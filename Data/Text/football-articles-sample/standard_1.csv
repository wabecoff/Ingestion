Rutten rejects offer to be Ten Hag's Man Utd assistant as he's 'uncomfortable' with the project,"Fred Rutten says he turned down the chance to become one of Erik ten Hag‚Äôs assistants at Manchester United as he felt ""uncomfortable"" about the project. Ten Hag has begun the process of building his backroom team after it was confirmed he will leave Ajax for the Red Devils this summer. Rutten, however, will not be among them as he would rather stay closer to his family in the Netherlands. Rutten, 59, is a vastly experienced coach having managed the likes of Twente, Schalke, PSV and Feyenoord over the last two decades. His assistant at PSV between 2009 and 2012 was Ten Hag, who has since gone on to establish himself as an elite manager in his own right. The 52-year-old was keen for a reunion with Rutten at Old Trafford, this time with the roles reversed, but Rutten was not interested in the move to England, instead revealing that he could return to PSV as assistant to new boss Ruud van Nistelrooy instead. ‚ÄúErik ten Hag has asked me to be his assistant at Manchester United, I said no,‚Äù Rutten told ESPN. ‚ÄúEveryone makes his own choices in life. I have a family, I have grandchildren that I want to see. This type of project, I felt uncomfortable with it. ‚ÄúAt Manchester United you get on a train and you can‚Äôt get off it.

Bayern Munich's Lewandowski equals yet another Gerd Muller record with 30 Bundesliga goals for fifth time,"Bayern Munich sharpshooter Robert Lewandowski has tied with Gerd Muller as the man with the most 30-goal Bundesliga season hauls in the league's history.  Lewandowski hit twice on Saturday to help his side take down Union Berlin in a comfortable 4-0 win.  Victory lengthens Bayern's lead at the top of the standings in Germany, while the Poland international's double also secured yet another record for the prolific striker.  The 33-year-old was on target with a penalty in injury time during the first half at the Allianz Arena and doubled his tally just after the break to put Bayern 4-0 ahead.  Earlier, Kingsley Coman and teenage defender Tanguy Nianzou were on target to put the hosts into a commanding position early on.  All eyes were on Lewandowski, though, as he took his season's tally to 31 in the Bundesliga and 45 overall, a number he has reached in just 37 matches.  Robert Lewandowski has scored 30 goals in the Bundesliga for the fifth time, equalling Gerd Muller‚Äôs record üëëAll the other players in Bundesliga history have only reached the 30-goal mark five times COMBINED ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/9qMF7IOqJo This is his fifth season in which the Pole has reached 30 in the league, a feat which only Bayern legend Muller has ever achieved before.  Lewandowski's latest goals come at a time of fevered speculation over the forward's future at Bayern, where he has starred since joining on a free transfer from Borussia Dortmund in 2014.  He has just one year remaining on his contract after the current season, and so far an extension offer is yet to materialise.  Just who is to blame for the stand-off, however, is a matter for some debate.  Ex-Bayern and Germany star Lothar Matthaus recently pointed the finger at his former employers, calling them ""disrespectful"" for keeping the player waiting.  Another old boy, Markus Babbel, on the other hand, believes Lewandowski is at fault and accused him of ""making a circus"" out of negotiations.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-s-lewandowski-equals-yet-another-gerd-muller/blt0951b18e27dc6668,Daniel Edwards,0fa80066-a7dd-44d8-9329-4bfdf9ea7904
The ultimate Chelsea season preview: Tuchel's still at the wheel but can Sterling carry title challenge?,"Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel declared himself ready, willing and able to drive some of his players to matches in a seven-seater ‚Äì that's how grave the situation was as Stamford Bridge just a few months ago. No top European club had a more tumultuous 2021-22 campaign than the Blues. Not even Barcelona! The financial chaos caused by Roman Abramovich's removal as owner meant that there was a very real fear that the club might go under. Chelsea survived, of course, and despite the colossal off-field distraction, Tuchel still managed to secure a third-place finish, thus securing Champions League football for another season. Of course, for all of the problems created by Abramovich's enforced sale of the club because of his ties to the Kremlin, Tuchel remained in possession of a stellar squad. Indeed, just a couple of months before Stamford Bridge was thrown into turmoil by sanctions imposed upon Abramovich after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chelsea had followed up their UEFA Super Cup success at the start of the season by winning the Club World Cup for the first time in their history. The Blues could have easily added another couple of trophies, too, but they were beaten on penalties by Liverpool in both the final of the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup. Some key players have since departed but Chelsea's new owners, a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, have been extremely active in the transfer market this summer. Optimism, then, has returned to west London, particularly as it seems that more new players will arrive before the close of the transfer window...",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/chelsea-season-preview-tuchel-sterling-title-challenge/blt375415ef3f5ee8dd,Mark Doyle,fbeb1be9-f848-401c-a68b-69760d9bf493
PSG coach Galtier: I won't change our DNA despite risks,"Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier has pledged to maintain the side's DNA despite associated defensive risks. Speaking after a 6-2 friendly win over Gamba Osaka on Monday, he said it was important to allow his immensely talented forward options to thrive with the support they need. Despite the victory in Japan, Galtier acknowledged PSG were ""very messy"" at times in the second half, which he will try to address without hindering the squad's scoring ability. The head coach is set for his debut season in charge of the club after the dismissal of Mauricio Pochettino. ""Even if the preparation was very short [this pre-season], even if there were long trips, the fact of playing these three matches here against ready teams and in front of a large audience forced us to raise our physical level,"" he told reporters.  ""We have one week left before the [Champions Trophy against Nantes], we will still work with a lot of rhythm and intensity, make sure to correct the things that need to be corrected, but also insist on being complementary of each other.  ""Even if we never want to concede goals or concede too many chances, the DNA of my players is to play, to take risks, to attack and to score the most goals, above all we must not try to change that."" On the defensive lapses in the second half on Monday, he added: ""Annoyed is not the term. Like the second goal conceded, we must be more structured and not be disorderly.  ""We were very messy, not in the right timing, we had trouble moving around. This will have to be corrected."" The club from the French capital will play for the Champions Trophy on Sunday against Nantes in a meeting of last year's Ligue 1 and Coupe de France winners. PSG then begin their Ligue 1 title defence on August 6 against Clermont Foot.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-coach-galtier-i-won-t-change-our-dna-despite-risks/blt0a02b1a2cc1895e2,Dan Bernstein,5fc91272-92f0-4a5b-b583-5a31e443ea5c
"SheBelieves Cup 2022 rosters: USWNT, New Zealand, Iceland & Czech Republic squads in full","The U.S. women's national team and the SheBelieves Cup return in February, with the hosts welcoming the Czech Republic, Iceland and New Zealand for this year's tournament. The 2022 edition of the round-robin competition will see games played in California and Texas, with the winner to be the team sat top of the standings after each nation has played each other. It will be the first action of the year for all four sides - though the U.S. did have a training camp in January - and it begins on February 17. Vlatko Andonovski's first squad of the year certainly grabbed attention, with star names like Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Christen Press and Tobin Heath all missing. The head coach justified this in his press conference announcing the squad, explaining that he wants to give opportunities to some of the younger players coming through - such as Sophia Smith and Ashley Sanchez - for this SheBelieves Cup camp. Trinity Rodman was expected to be included after a standout season in the NWSL in 2021, but was only called up as a training player, with Andonovski emphasizing the desire to bring her into the team slowly. However, on February 7, defender Abby Dahlkemper pulled out due to a back injury and Rodman was brought into the playing squad properly. Goalkeepers: Aubrey Kingsbury, Casey Murphy, Alyssa Naeher. Defenders: Alana Cook, Tierna Davidson, Emily Fox, Sofia Huerta, Kelley O'Hara, Becky Sauerbrunn, Emily Sonnett. Midfielders: Morgan Gautrat, Lindsey Horan, Rose Lavelle, Catarina Macario, Kristie Mewis, Ashley Sanchez, Andi Sullivan. Forwards: Ashley Hatch, Mallory Pugh, Margaret Purce, Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith, Lynn Williams. Player to watch: Sophia Smith One of the most exciting young forwards in the world right now, Smith settled well into her first full senior season with the Portland Thorns last season, scoring seven goals in 22 games. The U.S. will be heavy favourites for each of their games at the SheBelieves Cup, so will be expected to do plenty of attacking. Smith will be integral to that and could be one of the tournament's most dazzling players. Just five members of the Czech Republic squad that will travel to the United States do not play their club football in their home country. Goalkeeper Barbora Votikova plays for Paris Saint-Germain; Katerina Svitkova is in England with West Ham; Klara Cahynova represents Sevilla in Spain; and both Kamila Dubcova and Andrea Staskova play their football in Italy, with Sassuolo and Juventus respectively. Sparta Prague forward Lucie Martinkova is the most capped player in the team's history, having reached a century of appearances back in 2019. Goalkeepers: Olivie Lukasova, Alexandra Vanickova, Barbora Votikova. Defenders: Petra Bertholdova, Anna Dlaskova, Jitka Chlastakova, Lucie Jelinkova, Michaela Khyrova, Katerina Kotrcova, Simona Necidova, Gabriela Slajsova. Midfielders: Klara Cahynova, Franny Cerna, Kamila Dubcova, Tereza Krejcirikova, Aneta Pochmanova, Antoine Starova, Katerina Svitkova, Tereza Szewieczkova. Forwards: Klara Cvrckova, Lucie Martinkova, Miroslava Mrazova, Andrea Staskova. Player to watch: Andrea Staskova A rising star in the Czech Republic, Staskova was the top-scorer in Czech league in the 2018-19 season and Juventus didn't hesitate to sign her off the back of that. With the Italian giants, she has made a seriously good impression, boasting an excellent scoring record despite not being the team's first choice striker. At 21 years old, she is only going to get better, too. Iceland announced its roster for the tournament on February 4, with Thorsteinn Halldorsson's squad containing players from six different leagues. Eight of the 23-woman roster is based in Iceland, with the rest in England, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States. The most familiar names to fans in the U.S. will be Dagny Brynjarsdottir, the West Ham midfielder who spent three years in the NWSL with the Portland Thorns, and Gunnhildur Yrsa Jonsdottir, who currently plays for the Orlando Pride. Goalkeepers:Sandra Sigurdardottir, Cecilia Ran Runarsdottir, Telma Ivarsdottir. Defenders: Hallbera Gudny Gisladottir, Glodis Perla Viggosdottir, Sif Atladottir, Elisa Vidarsdottir, Ingibjorg Sigurdardottir, Gudrun Arnardottir, Asta Eir Arnadottir, Natasha Anasi. Midfielders: Dagny Brynjarsdottir, Gunnhildur Yrsa Jonsdottir, Agla Mar√≠a Albertsdottir, Alexandra Johannsdottir, Selma Sol Magnusdottir, Karolina Lea Vilhjalmsdottir, Karitas Tomasdottir, Amanda Andradottir, Ida Marin Hermannsdottir. Forwards: Berglind Bjorg Thorvaldsdottir, Svava Ros Gudmundsdottir, Sveindis Jane Jonsdottir. Player to watch: Glodis Perla Viggosdottir After five impressive years with 12-time Swedish champions FC Rosengard, Glodis Perla Viggosdottir joined Bayern Munich last summer and has settled well in central defense. The 26-year-old has top level experience that will be particularly important when Iceland face the USWNT and she is a goal-scoring threat at set pieces too, having netted three times in the league already this season. Jitka Klimkova, appointed head coach of the New Zealand women's national team in September 2021, announced her squad for the SheBelieves Cup on February 7. It includes Rebekah Stott, the popular and experienced defender who was diagnosed with stage 3 Hodgkin's Lymphoma early last year and has since undergone successful treatment. ‚ÄúShe means so much to this team and we‚Äôre honoured to have her back,‚Äù Klimkova said. Goalkeeper Lily Alfeld is the only uncapped player on the roster, which includes 17 of the 22 players that went to Tokyo last summer for the Olympic Games. Goalkeepers: Lil Alfeld, Victoria Esson, Erin Nayler. Defenders: Elizabeth Anton, CJ Bott, Katie Bowen, Claudia Bunge, Abby Erceg, Meikayla Moore, Rebekah Stott, Ali Riley, Ashleigh Ward. Midfielders: Daisy Cleverley, Betsy Hassett, Ria Percival, Malia Steinmetz. Forwards: Olivia Chance, Ava Collins, Jacqui Hand, Gabi Rennie, Emma Rolston, Paige Satchell, Hannah Wilkinson. Player to watch: Abby Erceg Defensive solidity will be key to a successful tournament for New Zealand and at the heart of that will be Abby Erceg. With 144 caps to her name, the centre-back has tons of experience with her national team, while her club career has seen her recognized as one of the best defenders in the NWSL, winning individual accolades for her performances as well as being crowned a league champion on three occasions in the United States.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/shebelieves-cup-2022-rosters-uswnt-new-zealand-iceland-and-czech-/blt95757f7d6d964dda,Ame√© Ruszkai,f8129bf1-3623-42c0-84ea-152ce6e19de4
Chelsea meet Sevilla's Kounde demands with fresh ‚Ç¨65m transfer bid,"Chelsea have increased their bid for Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde to the ‚Ç¨65 million (¬£55m/$66m) asking price provided by the Spanish outfit, GOAL can confirm, with the Blues tabling a fresh transfer offer in their attempt to bring the Frenchman to Stamford Bridge. Thomas Tuchel's side have conducted a lengthy, on-off pursuit of the defender from La Liga over the past year, seeking to bring one of their long-term targets to the Premier League to shore up their defence. With Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen's departures, the need to bolster their back-line ranks has become more imperative - but having seen their previous bids knocked back for failing to match the price requested, they have now stumped up a deal that meets his valuation. Having been turned down with a recent move for the defender, the Blues have returned with a package they hope will appease Sevilla, who have been reluctant to let one of their star performers depart the club this summer. Reports confirmed by GOAL Spain have alluded to the fresh proposition as an attractive offer - and Chelsea will hope that it provides enough to sway the club as they work on the player. Kounde is reportedly not only in discussions with the Premier League outfit but also with Barcelona over a potential move - though just how much financial clout the cash-strapped Blaugrana have after selling off key non-playing assets to land Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha remains to be seen. While the Blues have seen a fleet of outgoing faces following uncertainty surround the transition to the Todd Boehly era, the club now look to be moving forward with a belated transfer agenda. Though Romelu Lukaku has been loaned back to Inter, Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly have both represented major statement signings for Chelsea, as Tuchel looks to revamp his squad for another silverware charge. Another forward seems a likely option too after missing out on Barca new boy Raphinha. Chelsea had reportedly agreed a deal with Leeds United for the Brazilian, only for the latter to rebuff personal terms as he held out for Barca to stump up the cash for a deal with the Elland Road club.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-meet-sevilla-kounde-demands-fresh-65m-transfer-bid/blte5410557b88e3149,Goal Spain,45511ec3-971d-40ff-9521-07fb13a1ffdc
"Outplayed, Tierney & Partey injured - What next for Arsenal after Crystal Palace disaster?","If this was the start of the final sprint in the race for the top four, then Arsenal have just stumbled dramatically out of the blocks. Things had been going swimmingly for Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side in the Premier League in 2022, with the Gunners winning six of their last seven games ahead of Monday night‚Äôs trip to Crystal Palace. But with the pressure on following Tottenham‚Äôs 5-1 drubbing of Newcastle 24 hours earlier, Arsenal produced their worst performance in months as they crashed to a shambolic 3-0 defeat Selhurst Park. It‚Äôs a defeat that keeps them fifth, below Spurs on goal difference, although they do still have one game in hand on their north London rivals. But perhaps more worryingly, it‚Äôs a defeat that raises big questions about whether Arteta‚Äôs side have what it takes to stay the pace during the final weeks of the season. They were without Kieran Tierney due to a knee injury and there are fears the Scotland left-back could be out for the remainder of the season with the problem, which was picked up on international duty. Tierney, who will have a scan on Tuesday to determine the full extent of the issue, was replaced by Nuno Tavares on the left hand side of the back four and the 22-year-old endured a torrid time. The summer signing from Benfica was beaten at the back post by Joachim Andersen in the build up to Jean-Philippe Mateta‚Äôs opening goal for Crystal Palace and was then caught flat-footed by Jordan Ayew, who doubled the home side‚Äôs lead on 24 minutes after an error by Gabriel Magalhaes. Tavares was replaced at half-time by Arteta, with Gabriel Martinelli coming on. It was the second successive time that the Portuguese full-back had failed to even make it back out for the second half when handed a start by Arteta. And with Tierney potentially out for the remainder of the campaign, that is a major problem with nine games still remaining. Arsenal ended last season with Granit Xhaka as a makeshift left-back and it cost them dearly in the big moments, most notably in the latter stages of the Europa League. It could be that history now repeats itself with the Champions League once again on the line. And to make matters even worse for the visitors, they lost Thomas Partey to what appeared to be a thigh injury midway through the second half. The Ghana international signalled that he needed to come off, but the hosts broke through Wilfried Zaha before the ball could be kicked out of play and were awarded a penalty when Martin Odegaard tripped the Palace winger. Zaha, so often the scourge of Arsenal in recent years, made no mistake from the spot to pile even misery on Arteta‚Äôs shell-shocked side. Partey limped off before the penalty was taken. It could be a while before we see the midfielder in action again. His form alongside Granit Xhaka in midfield has been a big part of Arsenal‚Äôs recent form so a prolonged spell on the sidelines will be another major worry for Arteta. There was at least some improvement from Arsenal after the interval and they did have some chances, with Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard both wasting glorious opportunities and Eddie Nketiah hitting the woodwork. But the visitors were still well beaten. Outplayed and outfought all over the pitch. Arteta now has to try and raise his players ahead of Saturday‚Äôs game against Brighton. This is of course just their third league defeat since December and they do still have Champions League qualification in their own hands. But with Tottenham looking increasingly impressive under Antonio Conte and with Tierney and Partey potentially facing long-term spells in the treatment room, Arteta‚Äôs small squad is going to be tested to its limits in the coming weeks. The way they respond to this truly disastrous night in south London will go a long way to deciding how their season pans out.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/outplayed-tierney-partey-injured-what-next-for-arsenal-after/blt10cb75425717b64f,Charles Watts,58caafeb-e072-4f48-b25d-e2502f8cbe7e
Championship weekend betting tips,"Bournemouth are undefeated in 11 home games in all competitions this season, with each of those games producing at least three goals. Odds of 13/8 (2.63) seem generous on them coming out on top and over 2.5 goals going in once again when they face a Blackburn team that have won only three of 15 away league games but scored in eight out of 10 this season. Hull have turned their form around in impressive fashion recently, taking 13 points from the last available 15 in the league. They will surely back themselves at 21/20 (2.05) to overcome a Bristol City side that have lost five out of their last six fixtures on the road. Preston have lost just one of their last nine league games on home soil, while Barnsley have gone 11 away fixtures without a victory - losing six of their most recent eight. The Lilywhites therefore look a strong 5/6 (1.83) bet to come out on top for the fourth time in five meetings between the teams. Luton have lost four of their last seven matches in the league, while Fulham have won three and lost none of their previous four away games - scoring 14 goals and conceding only one. The Cottagers therefore look well worth backing at 17/20 (1.85) to claim maximum points in a fixture that has seen a home defeat in each of the two most recent matches. All odds correct at time of writing.

'Massive signing for MLS' - Columbus transfer Cucho Hernandez highlighted amid Bale and Chiellini deals,"Cucho Hernandez is a ""massive signing"" for MLS, says Columbus Crew head coach Caleb Porter, after the Colombia forward made the switch to link up with the Ohio club this week. The 23-year-old arrives from Watford following their relegation, and is the latest major name to arrive stateside amid a big influx of talent from Europe. But while Gareth Bale and Giorgio Chiellini have captured the headlines with their moves to Los Angeles FC, Hernandez has the potential to make major waves too, according to his new boss. ""It‚Äôs a massive signing for our club,"" Porter stated on the arrival of the attacker, who has penned a contract that will last through 2025. ""When you look at his profile, the age, his recent form, it‚Äôs a massive signing for the league as well - to get a young South American, 23 years old, who has proven himself in two of the top leagues in the world. ""We feel like he‚Äôs just beginning in terms of his career as well. He‚Äôs in his prime and he‚Äôll have the best years of his career here."" With Hernandez unlikely to be short of offers to stay in Europe, general manager Tim Bezbatchenko feels that his choice to come to America speaks to the growing quality of MLS as a league, adding: ""He's a young player who's entering the prime of his career. ""He's played and seen what it's like to play in the top leagues in the world, and yet he's choosing MLS because he believes that's the best place for him and his career, and where he can shine and be the guy and score the goals, collaborate with the coach and other players.

"World Cup 2022: Stadiums, fixtures & tickets","In 2022, the FIFA World Cup will head to the Middle East for the first time. Qatar won the right to host football's biggest tournament back in 2010. They remain on course to welcome world football's best and brightest. The World Cup will be a massive undertaking for the peninsula, with vast development and redevelopment of stadiums and infrastructure required between now and 2022. GOAL has all the information you need to know about the tournament as it approaches. The 2022 World Cup will be the first-ever to not take place in June and July. This is because of Qatar's hot summers, with the average high in June, July and August hitting a sweltering 42¬∞C. As a result, the 2022 tournament will begin on November 21 and be more compressed than normal, finishing less than a month later on December 18. Even at that time of year, it is still very warm: the average high in November is 30¬∞C and it only dips as far as 25¬∞C in December. As a result of the switch, several leagues will be impacted, with European football rescheduling to accommodate the tournament.¬† English football, for example, will be unable to play during the traditional Christmas period with many of the league's top stars in Qatar for the World Cup. A November-December tournament will also impact the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, which would have normally taken place the following January. The end of the year was decided on because of the weather between May and September as well as the desire to avoid clashes with the Winter Olympics (February) and Ramadan (April). Return to top World Cup 2022 will begin on November 21, 2022 and finish on December 18, 2022. Group stage fixtures will run from Monday November 21 until Friday December 2. The last-16 stage will commence immediately afterwards¬†with two games a day on December 3, 4, 5 and 6. There will be two rest days on December 7 and 8 before the quarter-finals are played¬†on December 9 and 10. üö® 2022 #WORLDCUP MATCH SCHEDULE üö®üèÜ It all starts in Qatar on Monday 21 November 2022 üåèüóìÔ∏èüëâ https://t.co/tIvYvRoy5j pic.twitter.com/yQvgGczszK ‚Äî FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) A further two rest days will be observed on December 11 and 12, with the semi-finals being played on December 13 and 14. The third-place play-off will then take place on December 17, with the final being played on December 18. Group stage matches will kick off at 10am, 1pm, 4pm and 7pm GMT (5am, 8am, 11am and 2pm ET). The simultaneous kick-off times for the final round of group games and all knockout games will be 3pm and 7pm GMT (10am and 2pm ET). The World Cup 2022 final will kick off at 3pm GMT (10am ET) and is set to¬†be played at the Lusail Stadium. Return to top Among the many questions being asked about the 2022 tournament is how exactly a country of 2.5 million, approximately one sixth¬†the size of Ireland, is going to welcome the world. This will be the last World Cup with 32 teams so Qatar will not, at least, have to deal with an expanded field. But the country's government - an extremely wealthy monarchy - still expects to spend between $8 to $10 billion on the World Cup, and that is substantially less than the budget initially touted. The original plan was to have 12 stadiums ready to host games but the number has been reduced to eight. The showpiece venue will be the Lusail Iconic Stadium, which will host the final and has the largest proposed capacity by far at over 80,000. The eight stadiums that will be used are:¬† It is hoped that all stadiums will be completed in 2020.¬†Yasser al-Mulla from the¬†Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, told¬†reporters in January 2018 that ""all the stadiums will be completed two years before the tournament starts."" One advantage of bringing the World Cup to such a small country, of course, is that travel times will be miniscule compared to the tournaments in Brazil and Russia. The greatest distance between two stadiums will be approximately 130 kilometres, a drive of approximately an hour and a half.

Conte admits Tottenham's top-four pursuit seems 'impossible' after third straight loss,"Tottenham boss Antonio Conte has admitted that it is likely ""impossible"" that the club will qualify for next season's Champions League after their 2-0 defeat to Wolves on Sunday condemned them to three straight losses under the Italian. First-half goals for Raul Jimenez and Leander Dendoncker put Bruno Lage's visitors on the path to victory in north London, leaving Spurs with no points from their last trio of top-flight encounters. Such a rut in form, following a nine-game unbeaten streak to begin his reign at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, has seriously checked Conte's momentum - and now the Italian has acknowledged that without the mentality to claim victory when the chips are down, his side will not make the top four this year. ""When you lose two games in a row at home and a previous game against Chelsea, a team that wants to fight for the Champions League, [it] is impossible,"" Conte told Sky Sports in his post-match comments. ""The problem is that you cannot buy the winning mentality. You transfer it day by day and [you are] not sure that [it is] day by day, because there are players that are more open and they understand the process quickly, other players need more time to understand this. ""Winning mentality in my opinion means when you play, [thinking] 'I am ready to kill you and to live'. This is the difference in every duel, every second ball, every set-piece."" The honeymoon period looks to be well and truly over for Conte, who has also seen a frustrating Carabao Cup semi-final exit against Chelsea further hamstring his quest for silverware after succeeding Nuno Espirito Santo late last year. His latest loss means that he has also matched an unwanted achievement alongside the Portuguese when it comes to barren runs without victory. Spurs have now lost three consecutive games for the second time in the Premier League this season, after losing as many on the trot in September - the first time they have had multiple losing streaks of such a length in a top-flight campaign since 2004-05.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/conte-admits-tottenham-s-top-four-pursuit-seems-impossible-after-/blt900b9d06f8af594e,Andrew Steel,2f5ad708-f7ce-4693-b357-836e46cd5e91
"Three games, 17 goals: Man City show why Guardiola doesn't need a striker in January ","Manchester City seem to have got over their goalscoring problems. A total of 17 goals in three matches would certainly attest to that. It makes a big difference if you are going to have an inexplicable wobble like they did against Leicester City - conceding three goals in the space of 10 minutes - but more of that later. Six goals against Leicester came on the back of four away to Newcastle and seven against Leeds for a remarkable, goal-laden 12 days of Christmas. It has been a perfect response, because the threat to City's title defence has always surrounded their lack of a guaranteed goalscorer, with coach Pep Guardiola admitting that City must cope without having a striker capable of scoring 30 times a season. The City boss wanted a striker, of course, but their failed summer pursuit of Harry Kane meant he once again had to mastermind a challenge using a mixture of false nines, inverted wingers and attacking midfielders. There were some easy victories early in the season, but many wins have been tighter than the comfortable scorelines that have become the norm during Guardiola's reign. There was even talk of the Premier League champions moving for a forward this January as Ferran Torres departs for Barcelona, but Guardiola was quick to shut that possibility down on Christmas Eve, saying: ""No, we're not going to bring in any striker in January."" With everything seemingly now clicking into place, he was likely right to do so. City's players are sharing the goalscoring responsibility at a time of the season when it really matters, particularly with a Covid spike causing havoc with the fixture schedule. Against Leicester, they had five different names on the scoresheet; in total, 19 players have now scored for the club this season. Raheem Sterling grabbed two against the Foxes - he has now scored in four Premier League games running - to underline an impressive return to his best form. A player that not too long ago was threatening to leave in search of game time has again become undroppable. ""He has been so aggressive in the one against one, his commitment to arrive to the box, he has been really good,"" Guardiola said. Kevin De Bruyne, Riyad Mahrez, Ilkay Gundogan and Aymeric Laporte scored the others as the goals were spread around. If that was not enough, there were another five different scorers in the victories over Leeds and Newcastle. Only at the start of the month, Guardiola was asked whether he was concerned that a lack of goals could potentially cost City the title. City were a point clear at the top of the Premier League but had a worse goal difference than both Chelsea and Liverpool. Indeed, they were nine goals behind Jurgen Klopp's free-scoring side, and now they are three ahead. Guardiola had remained remarkably unconcerned, insisting the goals would come and preferring to focus on chances created rather than missed. Those opportunities are still being created and now they are being taken. City started in blistering form on Boxing Day and were four goals up inside 25 minutes, with Leicester unable to cope with the devastating movement of Sterling, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Mahrez across the front line. But then came the exceptionally sloppy part as City were caught to concede three goals on the break as the Foxes threatened to pull off an incredible comeback. When opponents get their counterattack right they can cause City problems, and while Guardiola tried to dismiss those dodgy 10 minutes, behind closed doors it will be a concern and no doubt worked upon when they get back to the training pitch. ""It was a Boxing Day game,"" he told BBC Sport. ""It was a nice game to watch and three more points. We keep going. ""The quality of players we have produced this amount of actions to score goals. No manager and tactics can solve it without the quality."" Guardiola wants the perfect mix of lots of goals and none conceded, but it is hard not to focus on the positives as they head into the New Year. City sit six points clear at the top of the table, albeit having played a game more, and have now won nine successive Premier League games amid a rush of goals. Guardiola's side are starting to look very ominous again.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/three-games-17-goals-man-city-guardiola-striker-january/blt8ffcadae1ecf42f5,Jonathan Smith,fa42ba78-4f54-45b9-aaed-c2e0ec9a861a
Messi can put slow PSG start behind him with starring role against Real Madrid,"Even the most ardent Lionel Messi supporter would be forced to admit that things have not gone according to plan at Paris Saint-Germain. Six months into his adventure in the French capital ‚Äì his first professional club away from the bosom of Barcelona ‚Äì he has scored only two domestic goals. Yes, there have been eight assists and yes, he has hit the woodwork on an outlandish number of occasions, but Messi is held to a different standard to even his greatest contemporaries. While Ligue 1 continues to be a struggle for the seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner, he has come to life in the Champions League.  Five goals have come from five appearances in the competition, including a superb solo strike against Manchester City and a crucial brace against RB Leipzig as the Parisians came from two down at home to win. Tuesday, meanwhile, reunites Messi with Real Madrid, a club against which he has made his name like no other.  This will be his 46th match against Los Blancos and he goes seeking his 27th goal. Among his most famous contributions was a remarkable individual effort in the Champions League semi-final of 2011, when he carved through the Madrid defence to score past Iker Casillas. This is the type of moment that PSG are waiting for from the Argentine superstar and should it arrive, what has passed in the last six months would be easily forgotten. After all, following a decade of Qatari ownership, the Champions League remains PSG‚Äôs great ambition. It has continually eluded them, despite millions poured into trying to win the competition. They came within 90 minutes in 2020, when they lost a tight final to Bayern Munich, and the opportunistic summer recruitment of Messi was made with the goal of taking that final step. Certainly, there are few players more qualified with regards to his history in the competition.  He has lifted the trophy on four occasions and stands at second in the all-time lists for both goals and assists in the tournament. Although the 34-year-old has rarely shown this level in Paris, there have been signs of greatness in recent weeks.  A cute goal against Lille in Ligue 1 last week crowned a fine display against the defending champions, though he was quiet once again versus Rennes as PSG struggled to a 1-0 victory on Friday. ""Between Covid, injuries and the Argentina national side that has called him every month, his chances of adaptation have been limited,"" Mauricio Pochettino told El Pais. ""He‚Äôs never made excuses and neither have we. But he‚Äôs never played at a club other than Barcelona and when you arrive at a new side, you always go through a natural process of finding your place. ""Injuries, travelling and not being with your team-mates all lengthens the time for the team to adapt or for you to find the best version of yourself."" This slow integration has meant that Messi, for the first time in years, has been forced to accept that he is not the star man. Instead, that honour goes to Kylian Mbappe, who confirmed that status at the weekend by scoring a stoppage-time winner.  Having been revered as the greatest of all-time at Barcelona, this must come as something of a cultural shock for Messi. Nobody, though, is about to write the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner off as a lost cause.  A player of such talent is always only a matter of moments away from igniting something special, and that is especially the case in the biggest games. PSG have rarely seen the real Messi yet, but a successful performance against Real Madrid may just be the catalyst he needs to finally get going at Parc des Princes.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-slow-psg-start-champions-league-real-madrid/blt7eeef36c12a01ed7,Robin Bairner,c4fe715d-79f5-44ab-8072-5cc453c4889c
Tuchel admits Lukaku return not very likely after Chelsea's ¬£47.5m Sterling signing,"Thomas Tuchel has admitted that a return to Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku is not ""very likely"", with the Blues head coach suggesting he is now happy with his long-term attacking options following the ¬£47.5 million ($56m) capture of Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Lukaku re-joined Inter earlier this summer on a season-long loan after just one season back at Chelsea. The Blues saw little return on a club-record investment in the striker in 2021-22, and Tuchel has hinted that he no longer has a future at Stamford Bridge. The German head coach was quizzed on the 29-year-old while away on the Blues' pre-season tour of the United States. ""Given the fact he's just on loan, of course there's a chance,"" Tuchel told Sky Sports. ""I don't know if it's very likely, but it's not on me to give an outlook on that. There is a chance for it."" Chelsea have managed to add extra firepower to their forward line after losing Lukaku, with Sterling committing to a five-year deal following his switch from City. The Blues have also been linked with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski, but Tuchel says he would be quite content with his current attacking options if they don't manage to sign anyone else. ""We decided together with the owners that we'd let him (Lukaku) go,"" he added. ""It was his wish to go, he had the possibility, we let him go. ""We brought now Raheem Sterling, which gives us a lot of flexibility, a lot of mobility, a lot of attacking options at the front, even if we don't recruit more players.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-admits-lukaku-return-not-very-likely-after-chelsea/blt4ded18537f932d6d,James Westwood,40c3c6bd-8481-4745-bd80-8e96a5b2887a
"PSG's Mbappe proved he's 'best in the world' against Lorient, says opposing coach Pelissier","Kylian Mbappe was at his magnificent best as the Paris Saint-Germain star ran the show in a win over Lorient on Sunday, and opposing manager Christophe Pelissier said the attacker proved himself as the best player in the world. Mbappe played a part in five goals, scoring two while assisting three more in PSG's 5-1 win. The French forward teed up his superstar team-mates Neymar and Lionel Messi as each member of Mauricio Pochettino's attacking trio scored - the first time that has happened this season. ""When you're dealing with such a player, it's difficult,"" Pelissier said.  ""I think there are few people who ever see such strong players. Right now he's the best in the world. It's [amazing] to have him in Paris and to be French. But afterwards, when we are opponents, we are not necessarily happy that he is there."" Messi, Neymar and Mbappe all scored in the same game for the very first time on Sunday, with the youngest of that trio playing a part in all five goals. Mbappe helped set up Neymar on the first in the 12th minute, with Messi also playing a part in the build-up, before scoring goals of his own in the 28th and 67th minutes. He turned provider on a goal from Messi in the 73rd minute before setting up Neymar yet again in the game's final moments. 5 - Kylian Mbapp√© has been involved in five goals for the first time in his club career in all competitions (2 goals, 3 assists).

'The sad thing is he loves the club' -  Pulisic's dad sends message amid USMNT star's up-and-down Chelsea season,"Christian Pulisic‚Äôs father has taken to social media to express his frustration at his son‚Äôs situation at Chelsea. The USMNT international has struggled for regular action under Thomas Tuchel this season, with just 17 of his 34 appearances in all competitions so far being from the start. He was once again on the bench against Everton on Sunday despite scoring a late winner as a substitute against West Ham last weekend. Pulisic did make it onto the pitch at Goodison Park, replacing Timo Werner after 68 minutes, though he could not prevent a 1-0 defeat against the Toffees. Taking to Twitter after that game, Pulisic senior, Mark Pulisic, tweeted and then deleted: ‚ÄúThe sad thing is he loves this club, teammates, and London.‚Ä¶ puts his heart and soul into being a pro. Onwards and upwards my boy‚Ä¶big six months ahead.‚Äù Pulisic told Tuchel he ‚Äúalways wanted to be on the pitch‚Äù after his late winner against the Hammers last weekend, so to find himself on the bench once more at Goodison is likely to have been a huge disappointment. Despite being a talismanic presence for his country, Pulisic struggles to command a regular starting spot for the Blues. He has made just 10 starts in the Premier League this season, with his cameo at Goodison his eighth appearance off the bench. Pulisic‚Äôs last start in a Premier League fixture came against Burnley on March 5, when he also found the target in a 4-0 win. His father‚Äôs tweet suggests frustration at the forward‚Äôs predicament is rising, though whether it will lead to a push for a summer move remains to be seen.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-sad-thing-is-he-loves-the-club-pulisic-s-dad-sends/blt07263ae87eaa20cf,Tom Mallows,64e80876-2ce7-41c2-ae04-d2bfadb90a7a
Man Utd-linked Gakpo responds to transfer talk after PSV's Champions League win over Monaco,"Manchester United-linked winger Cody Gakpo has responded to talk of a potential transfer away from PSV Eindhoven. The 23-year-old was an integral part of the PSV squad last season as he scored 12 goals and made 13 assists in 27 league appearances. Gapko's performances have propelled him to the limelight and he is now attracting attention from some of the top clubs across Europe, including United, who are reportedly in the market for reinforcements in attack.  However, Gakpo wants to play in the Champions League, a competition that United failed to qualify for in 2021-22.  PSV took a big step towards the group stage after beating Monaco 3-2 in the first leg of their third qualifying round tie on Tuesday, and the Dutchman addressed speculation over his future after the game. ""We must first focus on and try to make it to the¬†Champions League,"" Gakpo told ESPN.  ""Then it is more likely that I will stay. I don't think I have said anywhere that I am leaving, so there is definitely a chance that I will stay.  ""I'm open for a cup of coffee with the management - or coffee for them and water for me.

Lewandowski doesn't need Ballon d'Or to prove he's the world's best player,"Robert Lewandowski should be a Ballon d'Or winner. There is no doubt about that. There may be legitimate arguments over whether he should have been forced to settle for second place behind Lionel Messi this year. But nobody can deny that he deserved to lift the award in 2020, when organisers France Football decided to cancel the vote due to the coronavirus pandemic. Even Messi admitted that the Bayern Munich No.9 was the best player in the world last year. ""Robert, you deserve your Ballon d‚ÄôOr. Last year, everyone was in agreement to say that you were the big winner of this award,"" Messi said after claiming his seventh trophy on Monday night in Paris. Lewandowski won the Champions League and Bundesliga in 2020, but has arguably been in even better form this year. Despite winning the Bundesliga again, with Lewandowski in record-breaking form, Bayern could not go as far in Europe, where the absence of their star striker through injury was apparent as Paris Saint-Germain knocked them out of the Champions League despite the Bavarians creating many more chances over two legs. Internationally, too, Lewandowski's performances with Poland have been impressive, with the centre-forward scoring 11 times in 12 games in the past 12 months, including three in three at Euro 2020. Poland were never realistically expected to compete for the European Championship and Lewandowski did as much as he could for his country, including securing a place in the World Cup play-offs as they finished behind England in qualifying. Being overlooked for the Ballon d'Or in 2021 will not cause the 33-year-old any sleepless nights, though, with legendary Bayern Munich midfielder Lothar Matthaus saying he has already moved on to his next target: Borussia Dortmund. Bayern travel to Signal Iduna Park on Saturday for Der Klassiker and a win for the visitors would move them four points clear of their title rivals. ""Lewandowski is always motivated. I'm sure he's not happy with the result in Paris. But he's very professional,"" Matthaus said. ""I have never seen someone more professional than Robert Lewandowski. He will not think on Saturday about the Ballon d'Or. He will think about his team, his club, to play a good game against Dortmund, score goals and win three points."" Lewandowski leads the goalscoring charts in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League again this season, which marks him out as an early contender for next year's Ballon d'Or. Win both of those again and it could be hard for next year's voters to look elsewhere, even with a World Cup on the horizon. 47 goals in 2020. 64 goals in 2021.No Ballon d'Or.Spare a thought for Robert Lewandowski üíî pic.twitter.com/yeYIVJ3VU9 International success with Poland is all but impossible despite the goals he provides, leaving Matthaus at a loss about what more Lewandowski could do to be named the world's best player. ""Lewandowski was playing at the highest level in the Bundesliga and in the Champions League, as top scorer, playing great games, breaking records,"" Matthaus said. ""But the journalists who make the decision decided on Messi and for that we have to congratulate Messi. But for me, Robert Lewandowski was the best player in 2021."" All Lewandowski can do is keep scoring goals to keep himself in the conversation for the 2022 Ballon d'Or. His former team-mate Jerome Boateng agrees, believing that Lewandowski will now want to score even more goals. ""It won't knock him down, but it has certainly been a big disappointment for him. But the way I got to know him, it will only motivate him further,"" Boateng told GOAL. ""He will continue to attack, I am sure of that. His statistics alone in the season so far are unbelievable."" Lewandowski will simply move on to the next victim and the next record. A goal against Borussia Dortmund would equal Klaus Fischer's record of 117 away goals in the Bundesliga. They're also the team he has scored most often against, with 24 goals against his former club in all competitions. He doesn't need a trophy to prove he is the world's best player. He just needs to keep scoring ‚Äì starting with Saturday's game against Dortmund.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lewandowski-doesn-t-need-ballon-d-or-to-prove-he-s-the-world/blt8a253e4f1812939a,Ronan Murphy,62be646e-1cd5-4cf6-aeae-ea947d42f63a

'I'd prefer none of them!' - Rooney makes Premier League title prediction between Liverpool and Man City,"Wayne Rooney has predicted who will clinch the Premier League title between Liverpool and Manchester City, while admitting that he'd ""prefer none of them"" win it. City cruised to their fifth Premier League crown and third under Pep Guardiola in 2020-21, and are currently in a strong position to retain the trophy. Pep Guardiola's side will be champions again if they win all six of their remaining games, but Liverpool are only one point behind them and Rooney thinks they could still leapfrog their rivals into top spot. The former Manchester United and Everton striker, who is now head coach at Derby County, is hopeful Man City will finish the job but fears Liverpool have the momentum after beating them in the FA Cup semi-finals. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer none of them but obviously one of them is.

Liverpool & Man City get 100 free buses for FA Cup semi-final after criticism of staging game at Wembley,"The Football Association has confirmed that the FA Cup semi-final clash between Liverpool and Manchester City on April 16 will take place at Wembley Stadium, but 100 free buses are being laid on for supporters following criticism of the decision to stage a meeting between two northern superpowers in north London. Questions had been asked of why two clubs from the north west should be forced to make their way down to the capital that weekend when a lack of train services would make getting to Wembley problematic. Semi-final encounters used to be held at venues such as Old Trafford and Villa Park, which would have been much easier for Reds and Blues followers to get go, but the FA has locked in a date at the home of English football and vowed to provide travel assistance to those intending to make a long journey south.

"Salah, Gerrard & Liverpool's all-time Champions League top scorers","Liverpool, having previously savoured four European Cup triumphs, did not compete on a Champions League stage for the first time until 2001-02. They have been regulars in elite continental competition since then, claiming two more crowns along the way, with some iconic names at Anfield helping the Reds to remain fiercely competitive. Some superstar performers have enjoyed many memorable moments under the brightest of spotlights ‚Äì including legendary captains and prolific frontmen ‚Äì but who has hit the back of the net on the most occasions? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Liverpool entered the Champions League at the third qualifying round in August 2001, with former England international striker Emile Heskey registering their first goal in a 5-0 win away at Finnish side Haka. Steven Gerrard, who was a starry-eyed youngster at the time but a man destined to become one of the Reds‚Äô greatest ever skippers, found the target for the first time in a clash with Dynamo Kyiv in October 2021. He went on to produce many inspirational European performances, but Liverpool did endure a notable dip between 2010-11 and 2016-17 as they made the Champions League just once. They burst back onto the scene in style after that wobble, with the likes of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane becoming talismanic figures for a team managed by Jurgen Klopp. Egyptian star Salah hit his first European goal for the club in a play-off round clash with Hoffenheim in August 2017, with Mane breaking his duck in a thrilling 3-3 group-stage draw with Sevilla a few months later. Both have been models of consistency since then, with Salah topping the all-time Champions League goal chart on Merseyside as he continues to add to an impressive tally in the present.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has five Champions League goals to his name, as does Diogo Jota ‚Äì with the Portuguese enjoying a stunning start to his time with the Reds.

The legendary Bob Paisley oversaw a third triumph in 1981, before a coaching baton was passed to Joe Fagan and he delivered again in 1984. It would be another 21 years before Liverpool conquered the continent again, but they did so in dramatic fashion under the guidance of Rafa Benitez in 2005. Having trailed AC Milan 3-0 at half-time in a thrilling final, the Reds hit back in style to complete the ‚ÄòMiracle of Istanbul‚Äô in a penalty shootout.

Real Madrid forward Benzema overtakes Thierry Henry as highest-scoring French player in modern era with 413 goals,"Karim Benzema's double for Real Madrid on Monday saw him overtake Thierry Henry as the highest-scoring French player in the modern era. Less than a week after he eased past Madrid icon Alfredo Di Stefano to become the third-top scorer in the club's history, Benzema has surpassed one of his country's all-time greats. The striker reached the milestone when he fired in twice against Mallorca to help Madrid strengthen their hold on first place in La Liga. Benzema now has 413 goals to his name for club and country. That sees him overtake Les Bleus and Arsenal hero Henry, who finished his career on 411. Overall, Benzema has scored 311 goals for the Santiago Bernabeu team, 66 for Lyon and 36 in his 94 caps for France. It is not known if that makes the 34-year-old the all-time scorer in French history as some historical data is not available, but he has confirmed his place as his nation's finest in the modern game. Benzema's stunning hat-trick against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last week saw him move above Di Stefano in his club's list of top scorers. He is now the third highest-scoring player in Madrid's history with 311 goals, while Di Stefano finished his career on 308.

Chelsea takeover latest: Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family confirm they'll bid for Blues before March 18 deadline,"Chicago Cubs owners, the Ricketts family, and billionaire hedge fund leader Ken Griffin have linked up to table a bid for Chelsea before the March 18 deadline. The consortium will make a formal offer for the Blues ahead of Friday's cut-off point, as the Premier League outfit continue to field interest amid the sanctions imposed on owner Roman Abramovich's by the UK government. ""The Ricketts family, owners of the Chicago Cubs, can confirm they will be leading an investment group that will make a formal bid for Chelsea Football Club this Friday,"" the family confirmed in an original statement. ""As long-time operators of an iconic professional sports team, the Ricketts Family and their partners understand the importance of investing for success on the pitch, while respecting the traditions of the club, the fans and the community. ""We look forward to sharing further details of our plans in due course."" The Ricketts family are not the only potential buyer for Chelsea, whose sale has attracted interest from numerous other parties. Among those are billionaire Nick Candy, who has been considered the nominal frontrunner, while MMA star Conor McGregor has been another candidate to throw his hat into the ring. Candy issued a statement on Wednesday that he had not held contact with a rival bid from Todd Boehly, adding: ""There are no talks under way with Nick Candy and the Todd Boehly and Jonathan Goldstein consortium,not least because Mr Candy does not want a lifelong Spurs fan as part of the future ownership of Chelsea Football Club.""

Defiant Neymar refusing to leave PSG 'until he wins Champions League' - so will Ligue 1 champions finally break their duck?,"Neymar remains determined to win the Champions League at Paris Saint-Germain and will not look to leave the Ligue 1 outfit until that target has been hit, claims the Brazilian star‚Äôs former agent Wagner Ribeiro. GOAL has learned that big-spending French heavyweights, who made a South American forward the most expensive player on the planet when snapping him up from Barcelona for ‚Ç¨222 million (¬£200m/$262m) back in 2017, are willing to listen to offers this summer for a global superstar. They do, however, have Neymar tied to a contract through to 2025 and the enigmatic 30-year-old is being tipped to stay put until he has helped to deliver a historic continental crown to Parc des Princes. When that question was put to Wagner Ribeiro by GOAL, a man that is more involved in marketing nowadays than player representation said: ‚ÄúNeymar has a dream: to be champion of the Champions League with PSG. ‚ÄúDespite all the rumours regarding a possible exit, he is very motivated and will not stop until he achieves it.‚Äù Quizzed on whether he likes the project at PSG, Ribeiro added: ‚ÄúOf course.

Bayern Munich boss makes Manchester City and Liverpool comparison as he addresses Kane transfer rumours,"Hasan Salihamidzic, the sporting director of Bayern Munich, minced no words to make it clear Tottenham striker Harry Kane is not on the wish list of the Bavarian outfit.  After the departure of Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona, the England international was tipped to move to Bayern to fill the vacant spot. However, there was no concrete offer from Germany and now Salihamidzic has quashed all doubts regarding Bayern's interest in Kane.  Kane's contract with Tottenham ends in the summer of 2024 and the prolific forward is yet to renew with the London club. However, Bayern will still not pursue the forward as they are trying to follow the footsteps of Manchester City and Liverpool who usually play without a typical No.9.  ""These are rumours. We're going a different way for now. Manchester City and Liverpool have been successful for years without a nine,"" he told Suddeutsche Zeitung.  The reigning Bundesliga champions had to let go of their talisman in Lewandowski after the Polish international forced a move from Allianz Arena, but Salihamidzic believes they have got enough attacking reinforcements to fill his void.  They got Sadio Mane from Liverpool for a bargain price of ‚Ç¨33.5m (¬£39m/$40m), and have also tied down Serge Gnabry with a contract extension.  ""We could substitute four players of almost the same quality for four positions. So much offensive quality is rare in Europe. It's now the job of the coach and his team to moderate that,"" said Salihamidzic. Bayern have let loose the strings of their purse in this summer transfer window and have invested heavily to make quality additions to the squad. They have roped in Matthijs de Light from Juventus, Mathys Tel from Rennes, midfielder Ryan Gravenberch and right-back Nousair Mazraoui from Ajax, spending more than ‚Ç¨137.5 million in transfer fees.

Carlo Ancelotti's men played their first three matches of the season on the road, picking up three wins and this weekend face the only other side in the division with a 100 percent record. Los Verdiblancos head to the Spanish capital following victories over Elche, Osasuna and Mallorca and bet365 price Manuel Pellegrini's at 11/2 (6.50) to record a fourth win of the season.

La Liga's joint top scorer currently is Betis' Borja Iglesias who is priced at 10/1 (11.00) ahead of team-mate Juanmi at 11/1 (12.00). Los Blancos are yet to keep a clean sheet this season and will surely be made to work hard by a confident and attacking Betis side. Pellegini's men have also been solid conceding just once this term and they should provide Madrid with their sternest test yet. Indeed, Betis boast a stunning record away to Real Madrid and are unbeaten in their last five visits to Los Blancos keeping a clean sheet in each of those five games. With the side from Seville in excellent form there should be plenty of interest in backing them to prove competitive opponents for the Spanish and European champions. Betis are offered at evens (2.01) to win with a +1.25 Asian handicap. This bet pays out in full if the visitors win or draw, while providing a half win if they lose by only one goal. This bet only loses if Betis lose by two or more, something that has not happened at the Bernabeu since 2015.

'I love this club!' - Rashford angered by Man Utd staff rift rumours,"Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has dismissed reports that the squad has turned against new manager Ralf Rangnick, while admitting he is not happy with how he has played in recent outings. Despite suffering just one defeat in six matches since taking over from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Rangnick has come under fire amid claims he has already lost the Old Trafford dressing room. Rashford, however, insists there are no truth to those rumours and that he is focused on improving his own game. ""We've all been disappointed with recent performances and we've been as disappointed with the news coverage questioning our commitment to not only the manager and the coaching staff but the club,""¬†the England striker signalled in a statement published on Twitter on Saturday. ""I have endless respect for both and I'm looking forward to bettering my game under the staff... I'm not sulking, I'm not unhappy. ""Am I disappointed in some recent performances? Of course I am. I'm my own biggest critic. It's been a tough start but I am determined to prove my worth. My dedication and my desire should never have been in question. I love this club."" https://t.co/SmpwLWT4mP pic.twitter.com/1I258YvrCm Rashford was one of the players singled out for criticism after a lacklustre display off the bench during United's 1-0 defeat to Wolves, which marked a poor start to 2022. ‚ÄúMarcus Rashford comes off the bench and you are expecting him to go out there and really fly and give it some. And sometimes you see him losing the ball and the reaction to losing the ball isn‚Äôt what you want to see,"" ex-Red Devil Rio Ferdinand fired on Vibe With Five. ‚ÄúThat could be down to him not being happy not playing etc. But you‚Äôve got to put that to one side. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre out of the team it‚Äôs about coming in and proving to the manager what you‚Äôre about and who you are. Maybe he feels he is not getting the opportunities he deserves.

Asamoah Gyan: ‚ÄòBetrayed‚Äô Ghana striker opens up on losing captaincy to Andre Ayew,"Former Ghana skipper Asamoah Gyan has revealed he felt ‚Äúbetrayed‚Äù on losing the armband to Andre Ayew ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals. About six months prior to the continental showpiece in Egypt, Ghana were caught in controversy as the leadership of the Black Stars was switched by then head coach James Kwasi Appiah, forcing the displeased Gyan to prematurely call time on his international career. The veteran striker, however, rescinded his decision in time to join the team for the tournament, where the Stars exited in the Round of 16. ‚ÄúI felt betrayed when the captaincy was taken from me because the people who know what actually ensued will tell you that they know that I was betrayed; that‚Äôs all I can say,‚Äù Gyan, currently unattached, told Asaase FM. Following their qualification for the World Cup in Qatar later this year, Ghana have been linked with a series of players, mostly based abroad, who could be included for the trip for the November 21-December 18 gathering. Gyan has, however, admonished the current officials of the Black Stars to be cautious on new additions to the team. ‚ÄúIt happened to my brother [Baffour Gyan]. In 2006 [when Ghana qualified for the World Cup for the first time], he played 90 per cent of the qualifiers and then they brought strikers who had never tasted one game [for the tournament in Germany]. He was on the standby [list],‚Äù said the 36-year-old. ‚ÄúThat was when my brother gave up on football. He doesn‚Äôt follow football, he doesn‚Äôt watch it, he doesn‚Äôt like it, he‚Äôs purely a businessman. Sometimes people have to be treated fairly. ‚ÄúNo player would like to be [left out], especially having played all the games. When these players come, they don‚Äôt even play one game. They just sit on the bench, get their bonuses and go, they don‚Äôt compete.  ‚ÄúIf they bring these players, they have to show us something, they have to prove to people that they deserve to get into the team, that‚Äôs all I want. We all want the national team to be better.‚Äù Gyan, who last featured for Ghana at the 2019 Afcon finals, is the Black Stars' all-time top scorer and most-capped player.

Teenager jailed for racially abusing Marcus Rashford after Euro 2020 final,"The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has confirmed a teenager has been jailed for racially abusing Marcus Rashford after the Euro 2020 final. Rashford was targeted by online trolls after missing a penalty in England's shootout loss to Italy at Wembley on July 11 last year. A full police investigation was subsequently launched, and a 19-year-old man has now been sentenced for directing a racial slur towards the Manchester United striker on social media. The CPS have released a tweet from Justin Lee Price sent after the final, which read: ""Marcus Rashford YOU F****** STUPID N***** MISSING A FREE PEN MY DEAD NAN COULD HAVE SCORED THAT."" Price initially tried to avoid detection after the post was reported by changing his username and denied the offence at his first police interview, before later admitting to writing the tweet. The teenager pled guilty to one count of sending a grossly offensive message by public communication network on March 17, and was handed a six-week jail term at his sentencing hearing on Wednesday. The senior Crown prosecutor for CPS West Midlands, Mark Johnson, condemned Price's actions at Worcester Magistrates‚Äô Court. ‚ÄúPrice targeted a footballer based on the colour of his skin and his action was clearly racist and a hate crime,"" he said. ‚ÄúThose who racially abuse footballers ruin the game for all. I hope this case sends out the message that we will not tolerate racism and offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/teenager-jailed-racially-abusing-marcus-rashford-euro-2020/bltbcb3666e1b84b273,James Westwood,79dff85a-272b-4820-87a6-da948029c3ba
Morata wants to stay at Atletico Madrid after Juventus refuse to exercise buyout option,"Alvaro Morata is keen to return to Atletico Madrid after his loan spell with Juventus ended on June 30 without the Italian club exercising their buy-out clause. He has a contract with Atletico until June 2024 and wishes to honour that.  There are several clubs, including some from the Premier League, who are vying for his services but he believes that the best thing for his future is to play this season at Wanda Metropolitano, GOAL can confirm.  However, the final decision on the future of Morata rests with Atletico, where there is a feeling that the summer will be a long one with several possible departures and arrivals.  The team exceeds the Liga wage limit even after the departure of Luis Suarez and is working to sell some more. They are also looking to bring in a right-back on loan for which they will have to loosen the strings of the purse.  Both Atletico and Morata's entourage are aware of the economic need to rebalance its accounts and have a margin of ""fair play"". There is also a possibility that if an offer between ‚Ç¨30-35 million is tabled, it will be up for consideration.  However, the club does agree that given the market and the current economic restrictions, Morata is the best possible option.  The Spanish international knows that this is a World Cup year and it will be good for him to continue at his old stomping ground.  In the 2019-20 season with Atletico, he scored 16 goals and provided five assists in 44 appearances.  To earn a ticket to Qatar, he knows that he needs to do even better than that. He has been summoned to do the pre-season under Diego Simeone and the striker will be giving his all to impress the ever-demanding Argentine.  Although he would understand if the club sells him to fit into the fair-play bracket, Morata is convinced: he wants to stay at Atletico Madrid.

"Lecce vs Inter: Live stream, TV channel, kick-off time & how to watch","Inter Milan will travel to the Stadio Via del mare to take on newly promoted side Lecce to start their Serie A campaign on Saturday.  Lecce sealed a top-flight berth after becoming Serie B champions last season. In their first match they face a stern test against a Inter side who will be looking to reclaim the Scudetto after finishing on the second spot to eternal rivals AC Milan in the previous season.  However, Simone Inzaghi led the side to the Supercoppa Italiana and the Coppa Italia titles beating Juventus on both occasions. But their recent form has not been up to the mark as they have won just once in five pre-season matches and have conceded 10 goals. Manager of Lecce, Marco Baroni, would be licking his lips to take on Inter at this juncture when they are yet to hit top gear.

Inzaghi is likely to stick to his 3-5-2 formation with Lautaro Martinez linking up with Lukaku up front. However, it is expected that 38-year-old- veteran shot stopper Samir Handanovic will keep his place between the sticks, despite the arrival of Onana. He could be shielded by a three-man backline of Milan Skriniar, Stefan De Vrij, and Alessandro Bastoni.

To sum up they have made 13 new signings in their bid to stay afloat after gaining promotion to Serie A. Baroni prefers to set his team up in a 4-3-3 formation and should stick to this formation while they take on one of the most formidable sides in Serie A.

Arsenal to sell Ballard as transfer interest grows in Northern Ireland international,"Arsenal will sell promising centre-back Daniel Ballard this summer, should a suitable offer arrive for the defender. The Gunners have held talks with the 22-year-old‚Äôs representatives recently and GOAL has learnt that both parties have now come to a mutual agreement about his future. They have decided that Ballard will be made available for transfer, but only if the north London club‚Äôs valuation is met. Arsenal have been delighted with the progress Ballard has made during the past two years following impressive loan spells with Blackpool and Millwall. But they do not believe he will have a clear opportunity to get the regular game time he needs to keep progressing if he stays in north London next season. Another loan is an option, but with two years left on his current contract, the Gunners are now open to letting the powerful 6ft 2in centre-back leave permanently. Ballard made 33 appearances in all competitions for Millwall last season, helping them to a ninth-placed finish in the Championship. Several clubs have expressed an interest in Ballard, who has already established himself as a regular Northern Ireland international despite never having made a senior appearance for Arsenal. Millwall are keen on bringing him back to the Den, but they will face competition from a host of other English clubs, as well as some from overseas. While Arsenal are open to letting Ballard leave, they will look to have some sort of buy-back option included in any deal. Speaking earlier in the season, Arsenal‚Äôs academy manager Per Mertesacker spoke in glowing terms about the progress Ballard has made in recent seasons. ‚ÄúYou get players like Dan Ballard, whose development we are really proud of,‚Äù Mertesacker said. ‚ÄúHe was nearly released twice. To come back, work his way up and create a pathway for himself ‚Äì I‚Äôm just so proud of him. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs now a reliable defender, playing international football for Northern Ireland and scoring for Millwall in the Championship. It‚Äôs brilliant to see. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an example of staircasing ‚Äì taking your time in our system, because there will be a pathway for you if you perform at the right time.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-to-sell-ballard-transfer-interest-grows-northern-ireland-/blt5346b0dd29571906,Charles Watts,60269536-a4cf-417b-9daa-aaed853b54e0
"Mane, Salah were very quiet for Liverpool against Tottenham Hotspur - Owen","Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen believes Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane struggled to get a positive outcome for the club in the 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League match staged at Anfield on Saturday evening. The Reds had come into the match hoping to get maximum points in their push for the league crown, but their effort took a setback in the 56th minute when Ryan Sessegnon set up Son Heung-min for the opener. Luis Diaz converted a Thiago Alcantara assist in the 74th minute but Spurs held on to get a point. The result sent the Merseyside charges joint-top on the table with 83 points, having played a game more than Manchester City, who will play Newcastle United on Sunday. However, Owen was not impressed with the way Salah and Mane, who have been key for the club this season, played against the North London side. ""Mo Salah, very quiet; gave the ball away an awful lot, had a couple of wrong decisions, could have passed on a couple of occasions,"" Owen told the Premier League Productions. ""Sadio Mane, very quiet. Diaz was probably the bright spark."" Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp underlined the importance of a point gained but went on to admit his disappointment for not bagging all three with the title race now firmly in favour of City. ""It is an important point because we have one point more than before the game, so that's how it is. But we all know the situation,"" Klopp said as quoted by the club's official website. ""We are now top of the table. If you ask me, my favourite situation, it just stays like this with the same points tally, and City and us, we lose all the rest of the games in the Premier League and it stays like this.

Chelsea get Ziyech boost as winger is left out of Morocco squad for AFCON,"Chelsea will not lose Hakim Ziyech to the Africa Cup of Nations in early 2022 as an ongoing feud between player and international coach has led to the winger being left out of Morocco‚Äôs squad.

The Bosnian revealed in September, when first snubbing Ziyech, that his patience with the star had been pushed beyond breaking point. He told reporters: ‚ÄúFor the first time in my coaching career, I saw a national team player who doesn‚Äôt want to train and claims to be injured, although tests have shown he can play. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt tolerate it. Not this behaviour as long as I coach Morocco."" Ziyech responded by posting on Instagram: ‚ÄúNext time when you speak SPEAK THE TRUTH THEN...!‚Äù Halilhodzic refused to back down and said in a subsequent international break that he wished he had dropped Ziyech sooner. He added: ‚ÄúWe tried to talk to him, but you have to draw the line somewhere.

"Bayern Munich made statement with 7-1 Champions League win over RB Salzburg, says Neuer","Manuel Neuer believes Bayern Munich made a statement with their 7-1 victory over RB Salzburg on Tuesday in the Champions League round of 16. The goalkeeper, who returned from injury absence to start, said the Bavarians' defence was much stronger than it has been of late. Bayern Munich's back-line has come under scrutiny since last season, but they managed to contain RB Salzburg while creating abundant chances at the other end. ""That was a statement win,"" Neuer told reporters. ""I think we started well and had the penalties and from there it just took off. We're very happy with the performance today. ""I think we showed a different side of ourselves today and didn't concede as many chances on the break. ""We were also more stable in defence, which obviously gives us hope that things can continue in that vein."" Robert Lewandowski notched the fastest hat-trick in Champions League history, while Bayern Munich became the quickest side to reach a 4-0 scoreline (31 minutes) in a Champions League game since they did so themselves vs Dinamo Zagreb in September 2015 (28 minutes). From there, the German giants coasted to a comprehensive victory as Thomas Muller, Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sane also added goals. Last year Bayern Munich surrendered 44 goals in the Bundesliga, their worst defensive showing since 1995-96, and they subsequently let their two most experienced centre-backs (Jerome Boateng and David Alaba) depart on free transfers. Their defensive record has actually been slightly better this term, but they have kept only one clean sheet since January 15. So, holding a talented young RB Salzburg squad in check on Tuesday marked an important step forward for Julian Nagelsmann's group. ""It was a very, very good match - football-wise from our part, wanting to win, full of energy,"" Nagelsmann told SID. ""When we have this kind of energy, we are hard to stop. If we play like this in the Bundesliga, things would be even clearer than they are right now.""

"Ronaldo & Martinelli share one key trait, says Arsenal & Portugal defender Cedric","Gabriel Martinelli shares one key trait with Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo, according to Cedric, who has hailed his Arsenal team-mate as a ""fantastic"" player with a ""willingness to fight"". Martinelli arrived at Arsenal from Brazilian outfit Ituano for just ¬£6 million in July 2019 and has since proven to be one of the best bargain buys in the recent history of the Premier League. The 20-year-old is now a fixture in Mikel Arteta's starting XI and his performances have helped the Gunners push for Champions League qualification, with Cedric left in awe of his natural instincts in the final third. The Portuguese right-back thinks Martinelli has the same eye for getting into goalscoring positions as his compatriot Ronaldo, who is considered one of the greatest strikers of all time and is still going strong at the age of 37 with United. Cedric has also praised the Brazilian for his positive mindset, telling the Evening Standard: ""Gabi has this aim for goal. He likes to attack the space, like Cristiano. He likes to score goals. ‚ÄúBut Gabi has this willingness to fight. Even when he doesn‚Äôt play, he keeps working the same way.  ""He is an easy young kid to talk with. You talk and you can see he listens to you. He‚Äôs talented, but the way he works is fantastic.‚Äù Martinelli has appeared in 26 games across all competitions for Arsenal this season, with 19 of those outings coming in the Premier League. The Brazil international has recorded five goals and four assists to date, thriving in a new role on the left-wing since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's departure in January. Arsenal supporters will hope he can make a big impact once again when they take in a trip to Crystal Palace on Monday night, where a win will take them back up to fourth in the Premier League table.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-martinelli-share-key-trait-arsenal-portugal-cedric/blt2e70dc893a522139,James Westwood,79f996f9-1883-4251-b1d8-0e59bbfe7533
Afcon 2021: Fear of failure will fuel semi-finalists‚Äô thirst for success,"If any random observer had put forward Cameroon, Egypt, Senegal and Burkina Faso as possible semi-finalists before a ball was kicked at the Africa Cup of Nations, few would have objected. Maybe the Stallions‚Äô inclusion would have prompted some raised eyebrows, although the fact the West African nation had featured in two semis in their last three Afcon appearances preceding this year‚Äôs finals would have been a perfect riposte. The major challenge for host nation Cameroon was handling the weight of expectation of teeming fans across the country.  Indeed, the nerves in that opening game against Burkina Faso were palpable and they might have had egg on their faces had the 2013 runners-up not conceded a pair of penalties in a crazy five minutes before half-time. On hand to twice punish the Stallions from the spot was Vincent Aboubakar, who has had a storming tournament, leading the scoring charts with six goals. No player had netted more than five times at Afcon since 1998 where Egypt‚Äôs Hossam Hassan and South Africa‚Äôs Benni McCarthy racked up seven strikes, a tally Aboubakar could reach if he scores against Egypt. Of course, he has experience in this area, having punished Africa‚Äôs greatest side in the 2017 decider in Equatorial Guinea, sealing a comeback 2-1 success. Without a doubt, Toni Conceicao will look to the ex-Porto frontman to be decisive yet again against the seven-time winners. Be that as it may, the Indomitable Lions boss ought to be safe in the knowledge that Karl Toko Ekambi will be on hand to step in if Aboubakar‚Äôs level drops, as it did in the last round against The Gambia. The Olympique Lyon man netted a brace to seal a 2-0 success against the debutants to allay fears when it seemed the tournament‚Äôs top scorer left his scoring boots in the dressing room at Japoma Stadium. Aboubakar fired blanks for the first time at Afcon 2021, preventing him from becoming the only player in the tournament‚Äôs history to score in each of his side‚Äôs first five games in the competition. Toko Ekambi spared his teammate‚Äôs blushes and the pair ‚Äî who have contributed to Cameroon‚Äôs 11 goals ‚Äî are the dynamic duo leading the Indomitable Lions‚Äô charge to a sixth title. Older supporters will remember the 1972 failure, where the Lions could only end third as hosts. They strive to go one better this time, but they have Mohamed Salah‚Äôs Egypt standing in their way. It would have been easy to predict the Pharaohs‚Äô demise after that Nigeria defeat in the opening round. It would have been somewhat reasonable to foresee another disappointing Afcon showing for the North African giants to follow the 2019 edition where they were eliminated by South Africa in the Round of 16 despite hosting the competition. Carlos Queiroz‚Äôs troops may have only two open-play goals at this finals, but the strength and resilience shown since the 1-0 loss to the Super Eagles mean they must be taken seriously. In Salah, they possess the tournament‚Äôs best player, whose importance and game-changing quality will strike fear into any defence.  The Liverpool star has been directly involved in all but one of the Pharaohs‚Äô four goals so far, brilliantly setting up Trezeguet in Sunday‚Äôs comeback win over Morocco for his third goal contribution. The Indomitable Lions‚Äô concession in every game but the last round suggests their backline is there for the taking, and Salah and co will strive to pounce as Egypt look to avenge that 2017 final failure. While the participants in Thursday‚Äôs semi-final can boast 12 Africa Cup of Nations titles between them, Senegal and Burkina Faso are yet to taste success in Africa‚Äôs esteemed competition. Aliou Cisse‚Äôs Lions of Teranga entered this year‚Äôs finals as the highest-ranked African nation and tournament favourites, a tag they have struggled to live up to. Having said that, it would be remiss to dismiss a strong showing in their quarter-final win over Equatorial Guinea on Sunday, a performance that indicated the West African nation could be hitting top gear at the right time. Their prospects are enhanced by Sadio Mane, who, despite not scoring in that 3-1 win last time out, was menacing for large periods, taking up interesting positions between the lines. In a sense, Cisse will be pleased his troops won without their talisman scoring, as they tend to lean on him to be decisive in these tight games. Be that as it may, the 2019 runners-up will look to the Liverpool forward ‚Äî whose shot conversion rate of 26 percent since 2017 is bettered by only Odion Ighalo‚Äôs 42 percent ‚Äî seeking another final and a chance to right wrongs of 2002 and 2019. Burkina Faso may be the least fancied side of all the semi-finalists, but the Stallions have earned the right to be here, battling through the group stage and showing a certain doggedness and determination to progress through tough knockout games. Since threatening to throw a spanner in the works of Cameroon‚Äôs big day, Kamou Malo‚Äôs troops have equally been undaunted by the political unrest at home to go within touching distance of only their second Afcon final and a first since 2013. ‚ÄúThese goings-on give us added motivation,‚Äù said Stallions coach Malo. ‚ÄúWe dedicated that victory over Tunisia to the people back home who are going through a turbulent time politically and socially.‚Äù Senegal must be wary of the Burkinabe‚Äôs menace in transition, particularly evident in well-worked strikes against Gabon and the Eagles of Carthage in the last round, the latter arguably the best team goal of the finals. The upcoming semis are fraught with anxiety with success now within touching distance for one of these four teams remaining in the competition. Whichever way the next couple of games play out, the four sides left deserve to be here and each will back themselves for a chance to compete for Africa‚Äôs finest honour in Sunday‚Äôs final.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-fear-of-failure-will-fuel-semi-finalists-thirst/bltf9474fb919b3548b,Seye Omidiora,4108caab-e441-4f19-856b-ee9a6dda927d

Nottingham Forest beat Huddersfield to end 23-year Premier League exile in dramatic Championship play-off final,"Nottingham Forest have ended a two-decade exile from the top-flight of English football after defeating Huddersfield Town in a dramatic Championship play-off final at Wembley to book their place in next season's Premier League. Steve Cooper's side overcame Carlos Corberan's Terriers to bring the curtain down on a 23-year absence in front of a raucous crowd in north London, with Huddersfield defender and Chelsea loanee Levi Colwill's own goal the decider. Yet Forest rode their luck to reach the finish line, after Huddersfield saw two penalty shouts in the second half turned down while goalkeeper Brice Samba was forced off through injury late on. The absolute SCENES at Wembley as Nottingham Forest book their spot back in the Premier League üçø pic.twitter.com/FJqSA8eeqN Having taken just one point from their first seven fixtures under Chris Hughton, the idea of promotion back to the Premier League - having been absent since the turn of the millennium - must have seemed fanciful to Forest fans. Under Cooper, they have sealed a remarkable turnaround, losing as many games in their remaining 39 matches as they did under his predecessor to seal an impressive fourth-place finish. That revival has now come full circle on the biggest stage of all - and means Forest, once regular contenders at the summit of the English game and two-times champions of Europe, will return to the top table. Mere hours after the rugby league club they share the John Smith's Stadium with were pipped for silverware across town at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, it was Corberan's side who came up agonisingly short in the end. Colwill's finish to turn Manchester United loanee James Garner's cross into his own net proved to be the decisive blow on the scoresheet, but the Terriers will have every reason to feel frustrated after a couple of huge calls went against them. Harry Toffolo saw a penalty appeal waved off by VAR after a near-foul by Jack Colback, while Max Lowe was fortunate to go unpunished for a clumsy challenge on Lewis O'Brien. All this came before Samba's late injury - and delay in getting off the field - which further stymied their attempts to find a late equaliser.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nottingham-forest-beat-huddersfield-to-end-23-year-premier/blt568ed6b22ecd233e,Andrew Steel,87c39d03-cf13-4d04-9285-c870fff5b923

Critics: Bafana Bafana friendly has no value for France - Deschamps responds,"France head coach Didier Deschamps has insisted that their upcoming friendly matches against South Africa and Ivory Coast have value.  The world champions¬†are set to take on Ivory Coast's Elephants at¬†Stade Orange Velodrome in Marseille on Friday, before facing Bafana Bafana at¬†Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille next week Tuesday.  Nicknamed Le Bleus, France have included high profile players such as Hugo Lloris, Raphael Varane, N'Golo Kante, Olivier Giroud and Kylian Mbappe in their squad for the two games.  There have been critics who have slammed the two matches against the African sides, suggesting that they have little value for Les Bleus, but Deschamps has dismissed this suggestion.  ""Some of you will say that these matches have no value but it is better to win them otherwise they will increase in value,"" Deschamps said during a press conference according to Sport 365.  ""I prefer to be in my place, qualified for the World Cup with two friendly matches on the programme than that of my Italian or Portuguese counterparts who will face each other in the play-off.""  Les Bleus have already qualified for the World Cup finals which will be hosted by Qatar later this year after they dominated their qualifying group - recording five wins and three draws from eight matches.  ""Do not trivialise an international gathering. The pleasure of meeting up is there because the players have chained matches with disappointments and moments of happiness,"" the retired defensive midfielder continued.  ""We haven't been together for four months: it's the return of the French team. Next, I am realistic. Many players are there, had very important matches before and will have very important ones after.""  ""We are going to play in Lille, the stadium is full and in Marseille, the stadium will be.""

'Wirtz hasn't reached his limits yet' - Leverkusen's NXGN star tipped for 'special career',"Despite an incredible Bundesliga season to date, Bayer Leverkusen wonderkid Florian Wirtz has yet to reach his full potential, according to the club's sporting director Simon Rolfes. Wirtz has scored seven goals and laid on 10 assists in the German top flight in 2021-22, while adding a further seven direct goal contributions in the Europa League. His fine form saw him named as the runner-up in NXGN 2022, finishing behind only Jude Bellingham in the list of the top 50 teenage footballers in the world. Rolfes is backing the playmaker to enjoy a ""special career"", though only as long as he continues to work hard and keep his feet on the ground. Speaking exclusively to GOAL and SPOX, Rolfes said: ""For me, he is without a doubt one of the best in Europe; one of the best in the world. ""Florian has great potential, as we have seen often enough, which will enable him to have a special career."" He added: ""Florian is only 18, he has not yet reached his limits... He can and must improve every year. No player in the world has completed his development at such an age."" Already a full Germany international, Wirtz has been singled out for potential stardom since he was working his way through the Koln academy. Leverkusen swooped to sign him in January 2020, and he has gone from strength to strength at the BayArena. ""I have been following Florian since he was 13 years old,"" explained Rolfes. ""What is extremely striking about him is that he has always given everything at every age, whether it was raining cats and dogs or the sun was blazing. ""No matter how good his team-mates were, Florian never gave up, he always wanted to win. ""In our first conversation here in Leverkusen, I told him that he had to keep exactly this gift. It's a great quality to always be able to get everything out of yourself.  ""He's a guy who always wants that, it's part of his game, and that will continue to drive Florian's development."" And what about any weaknesses? ""Off the top of my head, I can only think of one header he scored for us. And he hasn't scored too many penalties yet either,"" said Rolfes, with a grin.  ""But, in general, you can have problems looking for real weaknesses in Florian. ""That doesn't mean that he has 100 per cent mastery of everything without exception. But you will probably agree that his overall footballing performance leaves little room for complaint. ""Florian, however, is almost never completely satisfied with himself. He always wants more ‚Äì and that's a good thing."" Wirtz is currently in the early stages of recovery after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in early March, though there remains hope that he could return ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Rumours regarding his future continue to swirl, meanwhile, with Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Liverpool among the clubs to have reportedly shown an interest in signing him. Rolfes, though, is not concerned about newspaper talk when it comes to his star attacking midfielder. ""Florian is actually still an A-youth (Under-19s) player, you mustn't forget that,"" he said. ""We have a close relationship with his family and we all agree that Florian will be in good hands with us for a few more years. ""Of course, we can always stress that he has a contract until 2026, and that this contract does not include a release clause. ""People still speculate, that's what they're doing right now. But everyone here knows what they have in each other. That's why we are very relaxed in this respect.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wirtz-limits-leverkusen-nxgn-star-special-career/blte763922de8a54538,Jochen Tittmar,79c7a6ed-dd03-44c2-a41a-e429e98d3a5b

""I‚Äôm happy that once again I‚Äôm able to play well in England, as I‚Äôve played in Italy, Spain and Germany. ""It‚Äôs hard to say what didn‚Äôt work at Barca.

Coutinho is thrilled to be back with the Selecao as they try to finish an unbeaten qualifying stage in CONMEBOL. ""Today, I can happily say that this difficult time is behind me,"" he said. ""Tite's committee is very professional and qualified, always trying to be very fair with everyone in the group and I feel respected within the group.

Liverpool‚Äôs Salah is a match-winner and must start against Manchester City at Wembley - Murphy,"Former Liverpool player Danny Murphy has revealed the reason Mohamed Salah must be in the team‚Äôs starting XI to face Manchester City in the semi-finals of the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. The 29-year-old Egypt international has gone 753 minutes since he scored a goal from open play and against Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday, he was rested (on the bench) before coming on in the second half. According to the 45-year-old former England player, Murphy, who managed 170 appearances for the Anfield outfit and scored 25 goals between 1997 to 2004, Salah is a match-winner and must start against the Citizens. ‚ÄúIt is 753 minutes since Mohamed [Salah‚Äôs] last goal in open play for Liverpool but there is still absolutely no chance I would leave him out of Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City,‚Äù Murphy wrote on BBC Sports. ‚ÄúIgnoring penalties, Salah has not found the net with any of his past 38 efforts at goal over the past two months but he has to start at Wembley because he is a match-winner, and he has earned the right to play in big games like this one even if he is on a bad run. ‚ÄúI agree that he hasn‚Äôt been playing as well as he can do, but let‚Äôs not forget that since the 29-year-old Egyptian joined Liverpool in 2017, he has set standards with his goalscoring numbers above anything we thought could be possible. ‚ÄúWe are judging him against his own ridiculous record and the fact his statistics over the past two months are more ordinary does not change the fact he is capable of scoring remarkable goals that no one else on the pitch can, whoever the opposition are.‚Äù Murphy continued: ‚ÄúThat in itself is enough of a reason to pick him, but on top of that you have to remember the effect his mere presence will have on City. Regardless of whether Joao Cancelo, Nathan Ake, or Oleksandr Zinchenko play at left-back for City this weekend, they would fear Salah at all times. ‚ÄúThey all love to get forward themselves but they know that, when they do, they are leaving the Premier League's best goalscorer behind them. That is a very different dynamic to anyone else they could go up against in Liverpool's team. ‚ÄúWhile Salah didn‚Äôt score at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, he still had a huge impact on the game, not least with his perfect pass for Sadio Mane to make it 2-2 at the start of the second half. ‚ÄúI am expecting more of the same this time, and it would not surprise me at all if Salah actually scores the winner, because he has done it so many times before.‚Äù The clubs will meet for the second time in the space of one week after their entertaining 2-2 Premier League draw at the Etihad Stadium.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-salah-is-match-winner-and-must-start-against/blt51c360c38a4ab119,Dennis Mabuka,852bd126-44a8-46b2-9dd0-00ee46165649
Brentford fan arrested for alleged racist and homophobic comments during Man City clash,"A Brentford supporter has been arrested for allegedly making racist and homophobic comments during the team‚Äôs clash against Manchester City on Wednesday. The Premier League leaders won 1-0 at Brentford in their last game of 2021, with Phil Foden netting the decisive goal.

The Arsenal overhaul: How Arteta is restoring Gunners' lost soul,"When Mikel Arteta returned to Arsenal in December of 2019, he was shocked by what he found. It had only been three years since he had called time on his playing career and left north London to take up a role within Pep Guardiola‚Äôs coaching staff at Manchester City, but much had changed in that short space of time. The club he had left behind in 2016 felt different. The stadium, the training ground, even some of the players remained the same. But much of the soul had been sucked out of the place. It didn‚Äôt feel like Arsenal anymore. When asked during his official press unveiling whether he thought the club had lost its way, he replied, ""That's what I'm sensing from the outside. I would like to take some steps to start to understand the reasons why.¬† ‚ÄúThere will be reasons behind it, and a history behind it, and I have to try to understand quickly why this is. ‚ÄúWe have to create the right vibe, the right energy, and everybody at the organisation has to feel so privileged to be here. There's no other way.‚Äù It‚Äôs now been almost two years since Arteta made those comments and he has spent much of that time trying to bring a sense of identity back to the inner sanctum of the club. During his time as a player in north London, which stretched from 2011 to 2016, Arteta was well aware of what it meant to be at Arsenal. Arsene Wenger had spent two decades building an identity for which the club had become known throughout the world. But that identity became fractured during the final stages of the Frenchman‚Äôs reign. There was in-fighting behind the scenes over how Wenger‚Äôs departure should be handled, while large sections of the fans were becoming more and more frustrated with the direction in which the club was heading. Unity was a thing of the past and the cracks that were starting to appear widened during Unai Emery‚Äôs short tenure. The Spaniard was an extremely hard worker, but that came at a cost. He would shut himself away in his office, which was situated near the entrance of the main building at London Colney, and players and staff would often go hours without seeing or hearing from him. And he would often find no time to take any sort of interest in the youth teams or attend any of the games which were staged at the training ground. A disconnect appeared. There was no togetherness, no sense of everyone pulling in the same direction in an¬†attempt to turn things around. ‚ÄúI found an environment, a culture that I wasn‚Äôt feeling identified with,‚Äù Arteta said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about having a feeling of being privileged to represent this club every time you come through that door. ‚ÄúIf that is lost, you have to go, get back in your car and drive home because we are not going to move this club the way we want without a purpose.‚Äù The Gunners boss added: ‚ÄúIf I have to define our identity, that is one word: Unity. Without unity, you can‚Äôt achieve what we want to achieve.¬† ‚ÄúUnity means every person that works in the organisation. It‚Äôs our way of playing, our way of transmitting our values, our way of connecting with our fans, our ownership.¬† ‚ÄúEverybody, uniform, thinking in the same way, with the same purpose, without any individual agendas, without any egos. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we want to get, and I am going to push the boat very, very fast.‚Äù One of Arteta‚Äôs biggest strengths is his ability to get players to buy into his way of thinking. But he is also ruthless, as many have found out.¬† His first two years at Arsenal have been spent trying to completely overhaul a fractured squad which was bloated and contained players on big money that he did not believe suited the direction he wanted to take the club. It took some time, but slowly they have all been moved out and now, for the first time since he returned as manager, he has a squad that feels like his own. The summer transfer window felt a big moment in the rebuild, with the six additions adding a fresh and vibrant feel to the changing room. And the changes are now beginning to bear fruit, with Arsenal travelling to Manchester United on Thursday night sitting fifth in the Premier League and outside the top four on goal difference only. But it‚Äôs not just on the pitch that things are improving. Arteta‚Äôs work behind the scenes has been just as productive. He has pushed through big changes at the training ground, which has been given a facelift to celebrate former glories and remind the current players of the standards they need to try and follow. Arteta felt the corridors around London Colney were too sterile, so pictures, murals and inspiring quotes have been put up on the walls, with more to follow soon. One huge mural that the squad must walk past before heading out to train every day celebrates the record setting 49-game unbeaten run, while a giant picture of Arsene Wenger now greets the players when they enter the building each morning. A quote from Wenger sits on the wall underneath it, which reads: ‚ÄúHere you have the opportunity to get out the greatness that is in each of you.‚Äù When asked why having Wenger‚Äôs presence at the training ground was so important to him, Arteta told GOAL: ‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs something that we lost and we have to recover.¬† ‚ÄúI wanted that picture and a phrase that is very inspirational at the entrance because it was a big part of what he did at Colney and how everything started at the Emirates. ‚ÄúYou just look at his eyes and it‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs there. He has this capacity, he penetrates when he looks at you.¬†The players really benefit from it. He had to be there.‚Äù Arteta is now pushing for Wenger to return to the club in person, albeit not in a role of any official capacity. What the Spaniard would like is for his former boss to feel welcome enough to visit London Colney whenever he wants and to be able to pass on his experience, both to the coaching staff and the players on an informal basis. ""I think he would have a great time just seeing the environment he can create around him when he is around this place,‚Äù Arteta explained.¬†""Things take time and I think he has to dictate those timings.¬† ""What I can say from my side, and I think on behalf of everybody, is that we would be delighted to have him much closer."" As part of the London Colney facelift, Arteta has moved out of the office that both Wenger and Emery had by the main entrance and moved into one that sits next to the offices held by other members of the coaching and management staff. He works extremely closely with technical director Edu and academy manager Per Mertesacker, with group meetings now held in an open space within the new coaching area to try ensure there is a sense of openness and togetherness throughout the building. Arteta is now regularly spotted wandering over to watch youth games and training sessions and, along with Mertesacker, he is keen to bring legends back to work with the club‚Äôs youngsters. David Seaman has returned in recent months to help out with the academy goalkeepers on an informal basis, while Jack Wilshere was given the opportunity to work towards his coaching badges while he gets himself fit ahead of the January transfer window. There is still lots to be done at Arsenal and the ‚Äòprocess‚Äô that Arteta has spoken about since he returned is far from complete. But there is certainly a sense that the club is now in the best shape behind the scenes that it has been for a long time thanks to the work that has gone on during the last two years. Arteta said he found an environment he couldn‚Äôt identify with when he arrived in 2019. Now, two years on, the environment at Arsenal is starting to feel a bit more familiar.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-overhaul-arteta-restoring-gunners-lost-soul/bltfa5f328906eb3a94,Charles Watts,73049ba7-08b1-429f-920c-f53624917e57
Real Madrid boss Ancelotti: Bale's back is so bad that he couldn't walk,"Gareth Bale was absent from Real Madrid's Liga title celebrations because of a bad back, rather than because of a poor relationship with the rest of the squad, insists manager Carlo Ancelotti. Madrid sealed the Spanish league crown last weekend with victory over Espanyol and celebrated it with an open-top bus tour - but Bale was not among the players celebrating. Bale has been a peripheral figure at Madrid in recent years, spending last season on loan at Tottenham and rarely playing this campaign amid injuries and regular questions over his commitment. The Welshman's absence from the bus tour was viewed as being further proof of his being ostracised from the first team, however Ancelotti has moved to defend his player. The Italian coach said Bale was not on the bus because of serious back pain which prevented him from moving, let alone dancing and partying with the rest of the team. Speaking at his press conference ahead of facing Atletico Madrid in La Liga on Sunday, Ancelotti said: ""Bale couldn't even walk the day of the Liga celebrations, he's injured. If he was fine he would've been with his team-mates."" Madrid's Liga crown is the 35th in their history, and also represents an incredible personal achievement for Ancelotti - he has now won all of Europe's top five league titles as a manager, adding Spain to his Premier League, Ligue 1, Serie A and Bundesliga crowns. Having conquered all of Europe's leagues, there has been speculation that Ancelotti could retire from management when he leaves Real Madrid - but he isn't planning on that just yet. He said: ""If everything goes well here, I would stay until I'm 80, why not? It's an idea I have, the day I stop with Madrid, I can consider stopping. ""I've enjoyed it a lot. Looking for a better team in world football would be complicated.""

'He‚Äôs the best right-back in the world' - Alexander-Arnold battle forces Liverpool transfer admission from Williams,"Neco Williams concedes he may have to push for another move away from Liverpool in the summer as his path at Anfield remains blocked by ‚Äúbest right-back in the world‚Äù Trent Alexander-Arnold. The 21-year-old Wales international has made 33 appearances for Liverpool since graduating from the academy, with a title winners‚Äô medal collected in 2019-20. However he faces fierce competition for places on both sides of Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs defensive unit, with Andy Robertson another proven performer on the left, and a big future call lies in store for a man who has helped Fulham to bounce back into the big time during the second half of the current campaign. Williams linked up with the Cottagers on a short-term loan in January and admits another transfer may be required in the next window, telling WalesOnline: ‚ÄúI don't know yet where I will be playing next season. ‚ÄúI'm focusing on getting this year done, get the Wales games over in June and we'll see what happens then. If that's either staying at Liverpool, or if it's going out on loan again, I'm not entirely sure at this stage. ‚ÄúI've been at Liverpool since I was six and you always want to play for the team you grew up with, but I know it's not going to be easy. ‚ÄúTrent is only 23 himself, for me he's the best right-back in the world. I watch him in games and training and try to learn as much as possible from him. ‚ÄúTrent and Andy are incredible players who have been doing it for years. So it's always going to be tough trying to get into that team and be a regular starter. ‚ÄúHowever, the key thing for me is just improving every day, taking in as much information off players and staff as possible and trying to put it into my own game.‚Äù Williams has impressed while at Craven Cottage, opening his senior goal account while turning out in the Championship. He hopes he can follow in the footsteps of other buccaneering full-backs who have revolutionised that role in recent times. The Welshman added on the changes made to his position during the 21st century: ‚ÄúI think it just happens naturally when you look at how modern full-backs have developed. They're not like your standard Gary Neville kind of full-back today, I suppose, they're more offence minded. ‚ÄúThe best around, players like Trent Alexander Arnold, Andy Robertson, Joao Cancelo of Manchester City, are like midfielders or wingers trying to get assists and score, rather than just defend. ‚ÄúIt's an exciting role because you feel as important as any other player on the pitch.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/alexander-arnold-liverpool-transfer-williams/blt2504ef5de71f9725,Chris Burton,1045b986-1a9d-4b46-8988-f5bcc79488ed
"Osimhen, Napoli must prove strength of character against Roma","When Victor Osimhen halved the deficit with six minutes of normal time remaining against Fiorentina, the Diego Armando Maradona crowd refound their voice, knowing a point could still be salvaged after what was looking set to be a 3-1 home defeat. While Napoli could not eke out what would have been tagged a point gained rather than two lost owing to the flow of the game, the headlines were already writing themselves. Immediately Maurizio Mariani‚Äôs final whistle went, the cameras focused on a glum Kalidou Koulibaly standing in disbelief at what he had just witnessed, as the departing Lorenzo Insigne walked by. These two, more than most, perhaps knew what was coming.  Having experienced the cataclysm of the 2017/18 title race in which Koulibaly was somewhat culpable in the final weeks of Maurizio Sarri‚Äôs final season in Naples and last season‚Äôs final day failure to return to the Champions League following a 1-1 draw with Hellas Verona, Napoli were about to be accused of lacking bottle yet again. With Serie A not possessing any side as strong as Massimiliano Allegri‚Äôs 17/18 Juventus any longer, this season represents the Azzurri‚Äôs best chance of claiming a first Scudetto in a generation. Despite the recent setback, Koulibaly is not prepared to throw in the towel. ‚ÄúWe wanted to win at all costs,‚Äù the centre-back told DAZN after last week‚Äôs 3-2 defeat by Fiorentina.‚ÄúNow we need to prepare for the game with Roma and I still believe we can it [win the title]. We won‚Äôt look at the others, but we‚Äôll only focus on ourselves.‚Äù Napoli‚Äôs blushes were spared by AC Milan‚Äôs goalless encounter with Torino, a stalemate that meant Stefano Pioli‚Äôs team could only extend their lead over Luciano Spalletti‚Äôs men by a point, opening a two-point advantage over the 1990 champions. They have since extended that lead to five points, with Friday‚Äôs 2-0 success over Genoa heaping further pressure on Napoli who host Roma on Monday. Depending on where you stand, there is hardly ever indifference when discussing the Partenopei. You either reckon they are the real deal or, whisper it, serial bottlers who lack the know-how to go over the line at crucial points. That supposed mental block and both Milan clubs are what Napoli are up against if they are to end a 32-year wait for a top-flight title. In Osimhen, supporters at the Maradona have arguably the league‚Äôs most in-form marksman, with the Nigerian scoring five times and assisting one in his last three Serie A games.  This has put him on 12 league goals heading into Monday‚Äôs meeting with Jose Mourinho‚Äôs Roma where his next goal will see him match that 13-goal campaign from the 2019/20 season in Ligue 1. The strong-willed frontman has already surpassed last season‚Äôs return of 10 domestic goals, further impressive when considering the 23-year-old has achieved this year‚Äôs tally in three fewer appearances. There remain doubts over Osimhen‚Äôs decisive quality in the so-called big games, and the visit of the in-form capital club will test the Super Eagle who is yet to score in six meetings against teams possessing the technical quality to match Spalletti‚Äôs men. A strong showing by the Nigeria superstar will be timely, not least because of the ambition to close the five-point gap on Milan by three points and move level with Inter Milan on 69 points, but also to turn the tide of results this year on home turf. That loss at the hands of Fiorentina was Napoli‚Äôs fifth defeat in Naples this season, the seventh-best home record in the division. Contrast this with how they fare on their travels and the realisation that Spalletti‚Äôs men outrank every side on away results beggars belief. ‚ÄúYes, these home games where we could have jumped on top of the league table and instead we struggled, that‚Äôs the thing that gave me the most to think about,‚Äù the Napoli boss admitted to the media before facing his old side on Easter Monday. Two wins from five in front of their supporters will worry the tactician just as much as it should concern the players.  Failure to beat both Milan clubs ‚Äî interestingly the two other Serie A teams with impressive away records this term ‚Äî could be overlooked despite the obvious disappointment of not beating a title rival, yet the displeasure at losing to a Fiorentina side that had won only twice in the away league games since October (six defeats) probably hurts double. With five games remaining after this week‚Äôs round of fixtures (six for Inter who have a game outstanding), victory over a Roma side with 11 points from their last five away encounters is imperative to keep pace with the leading teams in the division. Napoli need a change at the Maradona to sustain this title challenge. In Osimhen ‚Äî who has contributed to four goals altogether in successive home games having previously scored only twice in Naples all season ‚Äî Spalletti‚Äôs top match-winner is finally delivering in front of their supporters. If the Nigerian delivers on Monday, not only will the home support‚Äôs belief in the young forward grow but it would suggest this Napoli iteration can cope under the weight of expectation of a Scudetto challenge.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/osimhen-napoli-must-prove-strength-of-character-roma/blt154ce13fa88bb90f,Seye Omidiora,8d8486ec-f7fb-44ef-90bd-3706db23916e
"Chelsea's best academy graduates of all time: From Terry to James, Greaves to Mount","Chelsea, one of the most successful English clubs in the 21st century, are known for buying expensive and talented players. Their domestic and European success has been built on their recruitment strategy, not just for the first team but also their academy.  The Blues have produced an array of top talents, thanks in no small measure to a revered scouting department that identifies potential talent at a very young age. Chelsea's youth academy at Cobham has nurtured many talented players in the recent past like current first-teamers Reece James, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Mason Mount.

'Maybe one winger has to play as a defender!' - Guardiola jokes on Man City injury crisis,"Pep Guardiola joked that he may have to field one of his wingers in central defence as Manchester City continue to contend with a major injury crisis at the back ahead of this weekend's Premier League game against Watford. The champions remain at the summit of the top-flight, and know that their title destiny is in their own hands as they prepare to face the Hornets, with Liverpool breathing down their neck. But a raft of injuries to key men such as Kyle Walker, John Stones and Nathan Ake has left them without several faces at the back ahead of both this weekend's test and next week's Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid - and Guardiola has now quipped that he may have to get creative in his coverage. ""Right now, we are definitely in trouble,"" Guardiola spoke when addressing his side's injury crisis. ""We have problems in many important positions and you have to adapt. ""The players know we are in trouble ‚Äî maybe one winger has to play as a central defender! ""[But a larger squad?] I don't like it. I'm sad to leave four or five on the bench who don't play ‚Äî I don't want it to be eight or nine."" Though City are now out of FA Cup contention, the club will still hope to go all the way in Europe alongside the Premier League, packing their tight schedule with even more matches - and Guardiola has spoken of how crucial it is for his team to take their moments to breathe when they can. ""It's better to recover and be fresh in your mind,"" he added. ""The sessions are exercises in socialising with laughter and positive energy. Practising can only be for five or 10 minutes ‚Äî we've lost players and cannot lose more. ""Today is the second day after Brighton and the Premier League don't know that the second day is when they are more tired. It's just relax and tomorrow we'll be ready.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maybe-one-winger-has-to-play-as-a-defender-guardiola-jokes/blt98f7173739ce6011,Andrew Steel,2fc8a5e7-5db0-4fd4-8432-831746a12ff5
Arteta's fixture fury - Does Arsenal's manager have a point?,"For once, Mikel Arteta let his cool demeanour slip. Arsenal‚Äôs manager had been his usual calm self when he sat in front of the press to dissect Wednesday night‚Äôs 2-0 defeat against Liverpool at the Emirates. However, when the questioning turned to the short turnaround facing his players before Arsenal‚Äôs visit to Aston Villa on Saturday lunchtime, Arteta‚Äôs anger suddenly bubbled over. ‚ÄúThank you so much to the Premier League for doing that,‚Äù he barked as he thumped the desk in front of him. ‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôve done it again when we have to play Chelsea and Manchester United [in April]. ‚ÄúSo, if they want to give them any advantage, I say to them: ‚ÄòThank you so much for doing that.'"" Arteta‚Äôs outburst took everyone by surprise. The short turnaround will give him very little time to work with his players, with the squad due to travel up to the Midlands on Friday having had a recovery day on Thursday. For a manager like Arteta, who puts so much value in training-ground preparation, that is an unacceptable situation. ‚ÄúIt is not fair what they have done,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, the players, they will be there on Saturday, with energy. ‚ÄúThey will eat, sleep well, but thank you so much to the Premier League for putting the fixtures like this. ""I heard some comments about me saying, 'Oh wait, when you are in Europe, it‚Äôs nothing new'.  ""But I‚Äôm complaining [about] the Premier League and how we schedule the games in the Premier League. ""When you are in Europe and you have Premier League, it‚Äôs a different story. What I am comparing is the Premier League and it‚Äôs very different."" Arsenal‚Äôs game against Villa will be their third in the space of just six days. The Gunners beat Leicester 2-0 last Sunday before their run of five successive Premier League victories was halted by Liverpool. The trip to Villa Park will bring an end to their gruelling spell, with the players then due to head off with their national teams for the international break. Given the crucial stage of the season and what is at stake for Arsenal, it is understandable why Arteta has been irked by the situation. And his complaints are not really over the actual fixtures, they are over the lack of suitable recovery time his players will get, something that he and medical staff believe will increase the risk of injuries. ‚ÄúThe first thing is to protect the players and we mention that many times,‚Äù he clarified during his press conference on Friday morning. ‚ÄúCan we please avoid Wednesday night and Saturday morning with travelling and other things? ‚ÄúI understand that they have commitments and TV. If you do it once, OK. But don‚Äôt do it twice. ‚ÄúWe still have the Spurs fixture [to find a date for]. Are we going to do it for a third time?‚Äù Arteta‚Äôs complaints clearly have merit. But nonetheless, he will be getting very little sympathy from a lot of his peers. ""I only want Arteta to remember the game between Tottenham and Arsenal that was postponed [at Arsenal's request],"" an angry Antonio Conte said when asked about the Arsenal manager's outburst. ""I don't forget this. I don‚Äôt want to speak about fair or unfair."" Three games in six days is far from ideal, but Arsenal have had things easier than a lot of other teams this season due to the fact they have not had any European football to worry about. Manchester United have had the Champions League, West Ham have had the Europa League and Tottenham were in the Europa Conference League before they were kicked out of the competition by UEFA. All of those sides have played more games than the Gunners.¬† United have totalled 40 in all competitions, West Ham 43 and Spurs 44. Arsenal, meanwhile, have played just 34 and have not had to deal with multiple overseas trips and the issues they bring. That does not excuse being forced to play the lunchtime kick-off on Saturday having kicked-off against Liverpool at 8.15pm on Wednesday night and it is a situation that could have been easily avoided by the Premier League and the TV companies. But sometimes it is best to keep your feelings to yourself. Arsenal took on Liverpool just under two months after the two teams had met in the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final on January 20. It was the Gunners‚Äô seventh game in that time period. Meanwhile, Liverpool had played 13. So, while there is certainly some merit in Arteta‚Äôs frustration, it must be noted that others have been coping with far more demanding schedules. And if Arsenal do go on to secure European football next season, they will have to adjust to playing games with far more regularity than they have during the past 12 months. ‚ÄúI think we had six games more than Arsenal [since the Carabao Cup semi-final],‚Äù Klopp said on Wednesday night. ‚ÄúThirteen and seven if I am right.¬† ""Thirteen games is really mad and it will not stop. I don‚Äôt complain, we don‚Äôt complain, it‚Äôs just how it is. ‚ÄúWe constantly travel, we go here, we go there. We wake up in a different hotel and somebody tells you where the restaurant is and you try to remember the number of your room ‚Äì that‚Äôs our life at the moment.‚Äù Arteta is a very smart man. He would have known he was going to raise the issue of the future scheduling before he walked into Wednesday night‚Äôs press conference. And there is no doubt that he has a point. There is no justifiable reason why a team playing a Premier League fixture on the Wednesday night should then be picked as the lunchtime kick-off on the Saturday.¬† It‚Äôs a situation that is easily avoidable. But this isn‚Äôt the first time it has happened and it won‚Äôt be the last.¬† As many have pointed out during the past few days, demanding schedules come with the territory of being a top team and that is what Arteta's Arsenal are presently trying to prove themselves to be.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-fixture-fury-does-arsenal-manager-have-a-point/blt701682c4b0ec36c8,Charles Watts,345e7b56-c2c1-462b-952e-6ada0c45b267
"Soccer City: Kaizer Chiefs‚Äô stadium capacity, location, facts & video tour","Soccer City, also known as the FNB stadium for sponsorship reasons, sits in the heart of South Africa and is the continent's largest stadium. Reconstructed and renovated in 2009, Soccer City hosted the 2010 World Cup final which saw Spain lift their first-ever World Cup trophy. GOAL brings you everything you need to know about this architectural marvel.  Soccer City is located in Nasrec, a suburb in Johannesburg's south-western region, bordering the town of Soweto. The stadium lies about five miles from Johannesburg's central business district.¬† Address: Soccer City Ave, Nasrec, Johannesburg, 2147, South Africa Google maps: Further directions to the stadium can be found here¬† If you're coming from the N1 motorway, which flows west of the city, take exit 67 for Randskouweg. Turn onto Rand Show Road and continue until you reach the T-intersection with Nasrec Road.  Turn left onto Nasrec Road and continue until you reach the stadium on your left. Whereas if you are using the M1 motorway in Johannesburg, take the Nasrec Road exit, then turn right at the intersection with Nasrec Road and continue until you see the stadium on your left. Fans can also make the most of public transportation to reach the stadium. The closest bus stops to the stadium are Soweto Hwy and Soccer City. From both the stoppages it's a 10-20 minute walk depending on which entrance you use. The construction of the Soccer City stadium began in 1986 and was officially opened in 1989. It remained largely unchanged until 2009, when it underwent major renovations as part of the preparations to host the 2010 World Cup.  The stadium's exterior was redesigned to resemble an African pot. Whereas the mosaic cladding on the exterior of fire and earthy colour combinations, with a ring of light running all around the bottom of the structure, is a marvel to watch.  Modifications inside the stadium ensured that no spectator is seated more than 100 metres (330 feet) from the pitch with an unrestricted view of live action.  The stadium had a capacity of 80,000 before the revamp, but now it can hold 94,736 people. However, for the World Cup, its capacity was limited to approximately 85,000 spectators. Soccer City's main tenants are Kaizer Chiefs, who play their home games there. However, the South African national football and Rugby Union teams are also regular users of the ground. Apart from the World Cup, it has also hosted the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996 & 2013.  Soccer City has hosted several pop sensations such as Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran.  Other events held at the stadium include large Christian gatherings, the most recent of which drew approximately 100,000 people in 2018. Whereas in 2010 it hosted its first rugby union match, a fixture between South Africa and New Zealand. Since then the stadium has hosted rugby matches regularly. A seating plan for Soccer City can be found on the Football Tripper website. Soccer City does provide guided stadium tours which include visits to the pitch, players' tunnel, changing rooms and the warm-up areas. Tours are available seven days a week, with the exception of event days, and last over an hour.

Bellingham 2023! Can Liverpool really afford to wait for the ‚Äòperfect‚Äô midfield signing?,"It‚Äôs been a busy few weeks at Anfield. With signings and sales, loan deals and contract renewals, Julian Ward, Liverpool‚Äôs new sporting director, has had his hands full as he looks to get the Reds‚Äô house in order ahead of the new season.¬† The drama, delight and eventual disappointment of last season has been swiftly forgotten.

"Speed, stability and Rick and Morty: Explaining adidas‚Äô new X Speedportal boots","adidas has extended its X line of football boots, introducing the Speedportal silhouette to the series of speed and movement-focused designs. The new boot takes this process in a new direction, quite literally. The key theme throughout the design process was the idea of ‚Äúmultidimensional speed,‚Äù a concept that reflects how football has evolved and how the role of speed within it has also shifted. ‚ÄúYou need to understand the game and the way speed is utilized,‚Äù explains Franziska Aurnhammer, Senior Product Manager at adidas. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre past the time where you talk about top speed linear sprints. Nowadays, in football, multidirectional speed is super important. It‚Äôs a high pressing game, attacks are faster, there is less time on the ball. There‚Äôs a lot of added pressure on players to perform faster not just physically but also the mental side. You need to react fast, take the right decisions quickly. That‚Äôs where the idea of multidimensional speed came from.‚Äù The focus on multidimensional speed comes after a long design process for adidas, beginning over two years ago and building heavily on the brand‚Äôs archive as well as insights from players and, for the first time, coaches. ‚ÄúOur goal is bringing a better product to the table every season for our athletes, that‚Äôs what we strive for,‚Äù says Thomas Mac√© adidas‚Äô senior design director of football footwear. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a great history of speed boots, and we use that as our starting point. We look at what our athletes love and dislike about the product, and then we try and improve it.‚Äù For the latest evolution of the X series, adidas focused its innovation on three main areas: the upper, the outsole and the stability system. Each of these sections of the Speedportal is designed to achieve the brand‚Äôs core aim of creating boots that allow players to be as fast as possible in as many different ways as possible. ‚ÄúWe engineered every millimetre of that material,‚Äù Mac√© explains of the PRIMEKNIT upper. ‚ÄúIt gives you the very best support in the right areas. Obviously a toe, a midfoot, the arch and the heel don‚Äôt have the same needs for the boot to increase speed, comfort and stability.‚Äù The upper is finished off with adidas‚Äô signature speed skin, which ‚Äúhelps to create the optimal ball to boot interaction,‚Äù according to Aurnhammer. The second major innovation comes on the outsole, particularly in relation to the studs. ‚ÄúWe knew we wanted to create a boot that enables the players to go fast in multiple directions,‚Äù Aurnhammer continues. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs how the studs were designed, they were designed to give you grip and help you push off in all different directions.‚Äù The outsole is also redesigned with two additional forefoot studs included. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been proven to bring a great performance benefit in terms of the initial push off to really get you going.‚Äù While both of these elements are important, the third and final section was highlighted as the most important thing for the professional players involved in the design process. ‚ÄúThe main thing from a performance point of view is stability,‚Äù Aurnhammer explains. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why on both the medial and lateral side there is a 2.7 millimetre TPU foil, a bit of extra reinforcement in the midfoot areas where it is crucial that you have a good lockdown, a tight fit, and really good stability to avoid having sideways movements that would make you feel less stable.‚Äù The stability innovations continue further than just adding some thin foil sections. Another addition is what Aurnhammer calls ‚Äústability wings,‚Äù helping to hold the wearer‚Äôs heel more tightly into the boot. ‚ÄúIt ensures that the players have the perfect fit and great lockdown,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúTherefore they are able to run faster, because they are more stable.‚Äù As well as improving its on-pitch capabilities, adidas has also improved the sustainability credentials of the boot. ‚ÄúSustainability is very close to our hearts at adidas,‚Äù says Aurnhammer. ‚ÄúFor the first time ever in football footwear, we aren‚Äôt using any virgin polyester. Also, the entire X range will now feature at least 50% recycled materials. In the upper. We‚Äôre really proud, it‚Äôs the highest sustainability standard that we‚Äôve ever achieved in football footwear.‚Äù Showcasing the technical know-how and experimentation that has gone into the X Speedportal, adidas recruited mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his grandson Morty Smith. The duo appear in an animated film ‚Äì alongside Mo Salah and Vivianne Miedema ‚Äì exploring the capabilities of multidimensional speed, and what it can do for Morty‚Äôs emerging football career.

MLS takes down Liga MX once again to win second consecutive All-Star Game,"WHAT HAPPENED? Mexican star Carlos Vela needed just three minutes to open the scoring while former Liga MX star and current Seattle Sounders striker Raul Ruidiaz adding another from the spot in the 73rd minute. A Kevin Alvarez stunner brought Liga MX back into the match, but couldn't find that second goal. THE BIGGER PICTURE: American soccer currently finds itself in a hot streak against Liga MX. In addition to winning both All-Star Games against Liga MX, MLS clubs have won the CONCACAF Champions League and Campeones Cup, while the U.S. men's national team has claimed both the Gold Cup, CONCACAF Nations League and, at the youth level, the CONCACAF U-20 Championship. Canadian soccer, meanwhile, is also on the up, having qualified for the World Cup while finishing atop the Hexagonal. ALL EYES ON: Of course it was Vela! The LAFC star, who has long had a tenuous relationship with those in charge of soccer in his home country, started the match with a bang. It was another reminder of Vela's quality, not that anyone who follows the league needed such a reminder. THE MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS:   DID YOU KNOW?

‚ÄòNo More Red‚Äô ‚Äì Arsenal to wear all-white kit vs Nottingham Forest in support of anti-knife crime campaign,"Arsenal have revealed that they will be supporting the ‚ÄòNo More Red‚Äô anti-knife crime campaign by breaking away from tradition and wearing an all-white kit against Nottingham Forest specially produced by kit suppliers Adidas. The Premier League club are throwing their support behind a cause that intends to shed light on the ongoing social issues that impact the lives of young people in London. There were more than 10,000 knife crime offences in the English capital between June 2020 and June 2021, with that 12-month period seeing the highest number of teenage murders recorded since records began. Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side will be donning an all-white kit when facing Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday. They would, with that contest taking place at the City Ground, have been forced to don a change strip in that fixture regardless as their hosts will be in Garibaldi red. An opportunity is being taken, though, to support those endeavouring to deliver noticeable change in London communities. ùó°ùóº ùó†ùóºùóøùó≤ ùó•ùó≤ùó± ‚ö™Last year saw a record number of teenagers murdered in London.

Instead, the 10 jerseys worn by the outfield players on Trentside will be gifted to organisations addressing the root causes of knife crime and youth violence. Film star Idris Elba, founder of Don‚Äôt Stab Your Future and mentor as part of No More Red, said: ‚ÄúFrom the time young people leave school, until the time they‚Äôre at home with family, there is often a void, a dangerous spike of nothing to do, where nothing can easily turn to something dangerous. ‚ÄúIf there continues to be no options for this after-school period, we will always see gangs form. Let‚Äôs create options for these young people.‚Äù Legendary former Arsenal striker Ian Wright added: ‚ÄúEvery young person deserves the opportunity to express themselves.

The opportunity to live free from fear of violence. ‚ÄúWe can never accept loss of life through youth violence as ‚Äònormal‚Äô in our city and it‚Äôs so important that we all work together to create a better environment for young people. ‚ÄúBy giving young people more places to play sport, more support, and access to individuals who can inspire them, together we can help make a difference to young people in London.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/no-more-red-arsenal-all-white-kit-nottingham-forest-anti/blt2d5c9f9e5529ede9,Chris Burton,886017ef-5c74-4c52-aed6-c6002fa4b570
Chelsea swoop to sign Arsenal wonderkid Hutchinson in shock transfer,"Chelsea have completed the surprise signing of teenage forward Omari Hutchinson from Arsenal as they bid to boost their academy ranks. Hutchinson was an integral part of the Gunners‚Äô Under-23s side that finished third in Premier League 2 last season, but has departed north London after finding first-team opportunities hard to come by. While Hutchinson did not make any appearances for the senior Arsenal side, he did feature in Mikel Arteta‚Äôs matchday squad on 10 occasions during the 2021-22 campaign. He will now, however, be available to Thomas Tuchel as the Blues look to yet again offer top English talent the chance to shine towards the top of the Premier League table. Born in Surrey, Hutchinson's formal footballing education began at Charlton Athletic before he joined Arsenal in 2015. Having honed his skills playing futsal, Hutchinson is known for his quick feet, supreme confidence and eye for the spectacular when it comes to goalscoring. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been known as a little skiller,"" he told GOAL in September 2021. ""I would say half of it has come from futsal. But also when I was younger, I used to do skills in my front room, in my garden and in my kitchen. Straight after school I would get changed and do skills. I loved it.‚Äù Over the past two seasons, Hutchinson has emerged as one of the stars of Arsenal's famed Hale End academy, providing 17 goals and 16 assists across the various age-group sides since the start of the 2019-20 campaign. That form caught the eye of Arteta, who invited him to pre-season training in 2020, but Hutchinson's failure to break into the first team has eventually led to him joining Chelsea. ‚ÄúWe are delighted that Omari has agreed to sign for Chelsea,"" the Blues' head of youth recruitment, Jim Fraser, said in a statement. ""He is a brilliant addition who joins us as an exciting emerging talent hoping to make a quick impression in the senior game.""

"'If Joao Felix knows what the problem is, he should tell us' - Simeone fires back at young star amid Atletico Madrid struggles","Diego Simeone has urged Joao Felix to come right out and say what he thinks after the Portuguese youngster hinted he knows what's wrong with Atletico Madrid this season. After winning La Liga last season Atleti sit fifth in the table in 2021-22, mired in a run that has seen them lose three of their last four matches in all competitions. And tension seems to be rising, as Simeone called out Felix after the attacker attempted to diagnose the team's problems. Speaking recently about his team's struggles, Felix told The Athletic: ‚ÄúI think we all know what the problem is [with the team], I don‚Äôt want to say though."" When questioned about his thoughts regarding Felix's claims, Simeone fired back, asking the young forward to speak his mind. ""About what Joao said, you can ask him,"" Simeone stated at a press conference.¬†""I work according to the team.¬†If he is clear about what the problem is, it would be good to know."" Felix, who joined the club in 2019, has featured 21 times this season but has scored just three goals. Entering this weekend's match against Getafe, Atleti are two points behind fourth-place Barcelona with league-leaders Real Madrid 17 points clear of their local rivals. Simeone, meanwhile, has come under fire recently for his handling of new signing Daniel Wass, having forced the former Valencia player to play on despite suffering an injury. ‚ÄúThis is how I‚Äôve always seen injuries, it‚Äôs nothing new,‚Äù Simeone said. ‚ÄúThe difference is this time he had an injury. Hopefully he can recover as soon as possible. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt apologised to him because normally when a player comes off, it isn‚Äôt anything serious and they can just run it off.

Southampton's Ward-Prowse on free-kicks: I only practice six per week!,"Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse has revealed he only practices six free-kicks a week, despite his reputation as a prolific scorer of set-pieces. The England international is closing in on David Beckham's Premier League record after another season filled with top-drawer finishes from such situations. Yet he has now dropped a nugget of information revealing that he does not spend his time agonising over his routines in training. ""Quite a bit, quite a bit,"" Ward-Prowse told Sky Sports when asked how frequently his set-piece skills are discussed by team-mates and fans. ""I think it's something that comes with scoring them, really. ""But I'm a football fan, a football lover so talking about them is not a problem for me. It's normally once a week [in terms of practice]. I try and maybe do six a week. ""I think it's a nice number to finish on. You don't get many opportunities in a game regardless, so what's the point practicing 20 a week?"" With 14 goals from direct free-kicks in the Premier League to date, the England international is fast approaching a record held by his Three Lions predecessor. Manchester United legend Beckham built a brilliant reputation for club and country as a set-piece master, and leads with 18.

Liverpool defender Van den Berg joins Schalke on loan as Reds get triple injury boost,"WHAT'S HAPPENING? The Dutchman was given permission to travel to Germany to finalise his move, after Schalke beat off competition from a host of clubs, including Blackburn, Bournemouth and Mainz. Van den Berg will now spend the campaign in Gelsenkirchen. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Van den Berg has been on the bench for all of Liverpool's four Premier League games this campaign, but spent the last season-and-a-half with Preston in the Championship, making a total of 66 appearances.  AND WHAT'S MORE: Liverpool's decision to let Van den Berg leave has been made easier by the news that Joel Matip is closing in on a return from injury. The 31-year-old was pictured in training with his team-mates at Kirkby on Monday, with Curtis Jones and Calvin Ramsay also taking some part in the session.  IN THREE PHOTOS:   THE VERDICT: Liverpool have always been open to the idea of Van den Berg leaving this summer, but with injuries mounting, the Dutchman has been required to help fill the substitutes' bench in recent weeks. Schalke represents a good switch for the 20-year-old, and a chance to test himself at top-flight level, in front of demanding supporters and against good opposition. WHAT NEXT FOR LIVERPOOL? It remains to be seen whether the Reds dip into the market themselves before Thursday's transfer deadline. Jurgen Klopp hinted last week that he would be open to signing a new midfielder, if the right player was available, but as yet there has been no sign of any movement.

'Put pressure on them' - Ancelotti reveals Real Madrid tactics to face Liverpool in Champions League final,"Carlo Ancelotti has revealed which formation Real Madrid will use in the Champions League final against Liverpool and says his side must put pressure on their opponents. Madrid will face the Premier League side at the Stade de France on May 28. The Italian coach says his side will line up in a similar shape to that which they have used for most of the current season. Ancelotti said at a press conference: ""[We will use a] 4-3-3 that will sometimes change to a 4-4-2. ""I think there is no defined system. Sometimes to put pressure on the pivot, as we did against Manchester City, you go from 4-3-3 to 4-4-1-1. ""The idea does not change much, just a little the way of defending the opponent, of putting pressure on them."" The Spanish giants are in with a chance of winning the European and domestic double this season, having already won La Liga. The Santiago Bernabeu team edged past Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in the knockout rounds of the Champions League to reach the final. Ancelotti's team had to pull fight their way back into each tie after falling behind. They trailed PSG by one goal heading into the second leg of the last-16 tie but managed to secure a 3-1 win at the Santiago Bernabeu. Despite beating Chelsea 3-1 at Stamford Bridge, Madrid came close to being eliminated as Chelsea managed to force the tie into extra time, only for the Spanish side to secure the victory. Then against City they were 4-3 down from the first leg but two late goals in the second leg took them into extra time, where Karim Benzema fired in a penalty to book a spot in the final.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/put-pressure-on-them-ancelotti-reveals-real-madrid-tactics/blta669f9921e3361f2,Peter McVitie,3c156e3e-f5ca-48ee-aaec-0e3dbf05f945
"Chelsea squad was 'not prepared for' Abramovich sale announcement, admits Kante","N'Golo Kante has admitted that the Chelsea squad was ""not prepared for"" Roman Abramovich's announcement confirming that he has put the club up for sale. Chelsea initially welcomed Abramovich to the club back in 2003 as he purchased the club from Ken Bates for ¬£140 million ($187m). The Russian billionaire has since overseen the most successful period in the Blues' history, with multiple Premier League and Champions League titles delivered, but his 19-year tenure now appears to be drawing to a close. Abramovich officially put Chelsea up for sale on Wednesday in response to the speculation that has been swirling around him since Russia began their invasion of Ukraine. As one of the richest and most influential men in Russia, it has been suggested that Abramovich could face sanctions as the UK, the United States and other major countries across the globe seek to cut off President Vladimir Putin's resources. The 55-year-old wrote in a statement on the Blues' website: ""In the current situation, I have taken the decision to sell the Club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club‚Äôs sponsors and partners. ""Moreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.  ""Please know that this has been an incredibly difficult decision to make, and it pains me to part with the Club in this manner. ""However, I do believe this is in the best interest of the Club."" Chelsea midfielder Kante has revealed that Abramovich's decision came as a huge shock to the whole dressing room. The Frenchman has urged his teammates to stay focused on football in these difficult times and expressed his hope that the conflict in Ukraine reaches a swift and peaceful conclusion. ""It's something we are not prepared for, it came quick,"" Kante told Sky Sports when asked about Abramovich's impending exit.  ""The only thing we can do, because we don't control these things, is to do the best playing football as we have always done, for the club, for the fans. ""It's hard to see things like this. We hope it finishes as quickly as possible and in the best way.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-squad-was-not-prepared-for-abramovich-sale/blt271cdc98c20451a4,James Westwood,388021d3-0ca5-416f-810e-f09ef6a4f11d

Sadio Mane's penalty 'shows cojones of the highest order' - Piers Morgan hails Liverpool star,"Renowned pundit Piers Morgan has lauded Sadio Mane's mental strength that massively contributed to Senegal's triumph in the just concluded Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) held in Cameroon. The Liverpool attacker starred as the Lions of Teranga defeated Egypt in the final to be crowned for the first time in their history. Extra time ended with neither side managing to find the back of the net. In the shootout, the West Africans managed to win 4-2 with the 29-year-old netting the decisive penalty. The winning penalty was also a relief to the former Southampton player who had missed the penalty earlier in the game. After being fouled by Mohamed Abdelmonem in the sixth minute, Mane dusted himself up, but his effort was saved by Mohamed Abou Gabal in the Pharaohs goal.  In the shootout, his early miss was forgotten as the ball found the back of the net and Senegal fans burst into celebrations.  ""To miss a penalty in an international tournament... and then win it later with one of the best penalties you‚Äôll ever see, shows cojones of the highest order,"" Morgan said on his official social media account. ""Take a bow, Sadio Mane, and congrats to Senegal on their first Africa Cup of Nations trophy.""

'He doesn't know who I am!' - Man Utd's Fernandes hits back at Agbonlahor criticism & reveals Mata's message of support,"Bruno Fernandes has hit back at criticism from former Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor, who singled him out following Manchester United's 4-0 defeat at Brentford last weekend. After the humiliating performance, Agbonlahor suggested that the Portuguese midfielder ""gets away with murder"" and described him as a bad team-mate. Fernandes has now issued a response, while also revealing that he has received a message of support from ex-Red Devils colleague Juan Mata. Fernandes told ELEVEN when quizzed on Agbonlahor's remarks: ""It‚Äôs honestly not something that worries me too much. He‚Äôs never played with me, he doesn‚Äôt know how I am."" The 27-year-old added on Mata's kind words: ‚ÄúJust yesterday I told my wife, who spoke to me about this interview and I said, ‚ÄòYou know what calms me down?‚Äô  ""Just two days ago a person called Juan Mata, world champion, European champion, winner of the Champions League, all in England, said to me, ‚ÄòYou were the best people I‚Äôve met in football, continue like that, being yourself, with that honesty, this ability to work‚Äô.  ‚ÄúIf someone says that‚Ä¶ you know how I am.

The German coach said that he didn't remember the former England international being a ""mentality monster"" as the last time he played against Liverpool, Villa lost 6-0. He added: ""I was close to calling in! I was close to calling in to tell him ‚Äòyou have forgot completely that you have been a player‚Äô. ""It was unbelievable and if ex-players are already like this, you can imagine how everything else is going.

Chelsea and England star Kirby out for 'foreseeable future' after suffering from fatigue,"Chelsea and England forward Fran Kirby has been ruled out for the ‚Äúforeseeable future‚Äù after suffering from fatigue. Kirby has not played since February and this latest setback puts her participation at Euro 2022 this summer is now in doubt. Chelsea boss Emma Hayes said there is no ‚Äúdefinitive reason‚Äù behind the fatigue and that more investigation is needed to reach a firm diagnosis. Speaking at a news conference previewing this weekend‚Äôs Women‚Äôs FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, Hayes confirmed Kirby would be sidelined for some time. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no chance of her playing at the weekend. She‚Äôs been taking some time in the background, she‚Äôs been suffering with a lot of fatigue. I don‚Äôt have a definitive reason why that is, we don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Hayes. ‚ÄúI think, forget the athlete, [she‚Äôs] just a human being and she‚Äôs struggling and we have to get to the bottom of that. I don‚Äôt think Fran will be available for club and country until that happens.  ""I‚Äôm not withholding [information], because I don‚Äôt have anything to tell you, because we haven‚Äôt got to the bottom of it. Until we understand some of the underlying reasons for that fatigue, I‚Äôd just be speculating. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going through a process of elimination to try and determine why she‚Äôs struggling. From my perspective, this isn‚Äôt the first time, it‚Äôs been ongoing for a lot of years. We need to give the time to find the right support so that we can come up with a diagnosis and then with diagnosis, you can come up with strategies. Right now, I don‚Äôt have any answers.

Liverpool's Salah wins Premier League Playmaker of the Season award for most assists in 2021-22,"Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has won the Premier League's Playmaker of the Season award for the most assists in 2021-22. The Egypt international ended the campaign with 13 assists to claim the award. He beat Liverpool team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold to claim first place. The 29-year-old had another excellent season. He shared the Golden Boot with Tottenham star Son Heung-min as they both finished with 23 goals in the English top-flight. His goal in Liverpool's 3-1 win against Wolves on Sunday ensured he finished level with the Spurs attacker in terms of goals. However no one contributed more goals in the Premier League this season, as Salah was the outright top assist maker in the division. Salah is also one of the top performers in the Champions League. He has scored eight goals and set up two in the European competition so far. He will have a chance to improve on that record when his team take on Real Madrid in the Champions League final next week.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-salah-premier-league-playmaker-of-the-season-most/blt1bad52738fbe5f90,Peter McVitie,85b7deaa-6aeb-44b0-a724-2e95c21055c2
'Kroenke ownership is as good as I've seen in football' - Arteta hails controversial Arsenal board,"Mikel Arteta has heaped praise on Arsenal's owners, the Kroenke family, after the Gunners electric start to the season. Arteta's team currently sit on six points from two games, one of only two teams to still have a 100 per cent record in the Premier League.  Arsenal have spent ¬£270 million ($319m) in the last two summers combined as they look to try and break back into the Premier League's top four, bringing in the likes of Ben White, Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko. And though they narrowly missed out on Champions League football last campaign, Arteta will be hoping he and his team can go one step further this time out. Arteta is particularly impressed with the level of ambition being shown by the Kroenke's ownership, telling a press conference: ""I think the commitment and desire of this ownership is without a question or doubt as good as I‚Äôve seen in football. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on it, they want to take this club to a completely different level. They have the ambition, and it‚Äôs clear, there is so much evidence that they‚Äôre giving us all the support we need in order to do that. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs great to see as well that now there is a little bit of change in that talk and even our supporters and everybody around the world is talking very differently about what is happening here.‚Äù Arsenal have failed to win the Premier League or any European silverware since the Kroenke's first bought shares in the club in 2007, leading fans to question their ownership and plans for the club, particularly since they became majority owners in 2018. The biggest controversy the ownership has faced is their involvement in the European Super League in 2021. The club, who finished eighth in the season the plans were revealed, were part of a group of top European clubs who announced a breakaway league. Fans protested the decision, and eventually all-but three of the clubs denounced their ambitions and the idea collapsed. It, however, left a stain on the relationship many of the owners have with their clubs, and Arsenal were no exception.

Tuchel reveals Kante is fasting & suggests lack of food may explain dip in form at Chelsea,"Thomas Tuchel has revealed that N'Golo Kante is currently fasting for Ramadan, which he believes could be an explanation for the Chelsea midfielder's recent dip in form. Kante was subsituted at half-time for the first time in his career on Wednesday night as Chelsea suffered a 3-1 loss against Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Tuchel insisted that the decision was a tactical one post-match, but Kante has struggled to reach his best level throughout the 2021-22 campaign while battling a string of niggling injuries and recovering from Covid-19. Tuchel also thinks a lack of food could be a reason for Kante's inconsistency, with the Frenchman having been observing the celebration of Eid since April 1. As a practising Muslim, Kante is not allowed to eat or drink during daylight hours until Ramadan ends on May 1. Asked whether the demands of top-flight football are catching up with Kante now that he is 31-years-old, Tuchel told a press conference: ""I can honestly not answer the question (whether football is catching up to him). One thing is very clear, N‚ÄôGolo is a key player with outstanding qualities, unique qualities. For other teams, maybe it is some strikers or central defenders.  ""For us it is N‚ÄôGolo, a unique player who can give something to the team that nobody else can. He struggles this season with consistency due to injuries, due to illness.  ""This is also a reason for our bit of inconsistency of course. We missed him for too many matches if you look at the minutes he is available he can play.  ""At the moment he is fasting due to his religion, due to his belief. Maybe another reason. He is not doing it for the first time but if you don‚Äôt eat during the day for many days it can have an effect.  ""He is used to it but yeah, maybe it is also part of the explanation why we had the feeling he is not on his highest level if you compare how much of an influence he was in the last campaign against Real Madrid.  ""This is also nothing to be ashamed of or feel sorry for. We try to push him, try to help him because we know what we have when he is on the pitch.‚Äù Kante will be available for selection again when Chelsea take in a trip to Southampton on Saturday, but will play on an empty stomach if selected. Muslims are only to permitted to break their fast between 19:30 and 20:30 BST, and the Premier League made allowances for some of the players observing Ramadan last season. In a meeting between Leicester City and Crystal Palace at the King Power Stadium, a pause in play was granted so that Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyate could eat, with an unwritten rule having been put in place allowing team captains to call short breaks before goal kicks or throw-ins. This season, it has once again been agreed that captains can call for similar breaks in play during their pre-match meetings with referees, but only nine of the 52 Premier League matches taking place during Eid are scheduled to kick off after 19:30.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-reveals-kante-is-fasting-and-suggests-lack-of-food/blt5eb28f905086e535,James Westwood,eb550adb-14c6-4c43-a6c8-70154a462180
"Messi's PSG struggles hurt, says Pedri, as Barcelona star hopes former captain returns to Camp Nou","Barcelona star Pedri says he is hurt to see Lionel Messi struggle at Paris Saint-Germain and hopes he returns to Camp Nou. Messi has so far been unable to replicate his Barca form since completing a free transfer to the French capital last year and the club's fans recently jeered the Argentina star and Neymar. He has scored just twice in 18 Ligue 1 matches and could not prevent his side crashing out of the Champions League as they lost to Real Madrid in the round of 16. Pedri has been watching his former team-mate's games in France and is sad to see him go through a difficult period. ""Whenever I can, I watch his matches because you learn a lot by watching the best footballer in the world play,"" he said to La Vanguardia.  ""But it's true that when things don't work out for a friend, as I consider him, it hurts a bit. ""I've had a great time with Leo on the pitch and off it he's a magnificent person so I hope he can come back.¬†I had fun playing with him and it is a joy to have him as a team-mate."" Just as Messi had a difficult start in France, Barcelona went through a rough patch in the beginning of the season. Results have improved since club legend Xavi took over as coach in November, culminating in a 4-0 win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. Pedri says Xavi has helped change his game and is happy with the impact he has had on the team. ""He always tells me to get forward, that any rebound or any play can result in a goal with a loose ball and that I can push on and help the team,"" the 19-year-old said.¬† ""And I have to pay attention to him because he's absolutely right, a goal in a play like this helps the team a lot."" He added: ""He is a coach who transmits confidence to us in all areas because he knows very well what he wants to do with the team and, as footballers, we understand it perfectly.¬† ""We know that we have to be able to control the game through possession and that is what he insists on the most.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-psg-struggles-hurt-pedri-barcelona-star-former-captain/blt76b000150aefc7d1,By Peter McVitie,b7bae7a4-5b87-42b5-b1b3-6e1c5c24bf03
Ghana FA retains Otto Addo to take charge of Black Stars until December,"Ghana Football Association (GFA) has retained Otto Addo as the coach of the national team, Black Stars until December 2022. In a statement on Ghana FA's official website, the German-trained tactician, who helped the Black Stars reach the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar, will be assisted by George Boateng, and Mas-Ud Didi Dramani while former Newcastle United manager Chris Hughton retained his role of Technical Adviser. ‚ÄúThe Ghana Football Association has appointed Otto Addo, Chris Hughton, George Boateng, and Mas-Ud Didi Dramani as coaches of the senior national team, the Black Stars until the end of December 2022,‚Äù read part of the statement. ‚ÄúThe quartet who masterminded Ghana‚Äôs qualification to the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 tournament will stay on to see to Ghana‚Äôs preparation for the World Cup, the 2023 Afcon qualifiers, and the World Cup itself.

During the competition, Ghana who were pooled in Group C alongside Morocco, Gabon, and Comoros, failed to go past the group stage after finishing fourth with one point. The Black Stars lost their opener against the Atlas Lions 1-0, drew 1-1 against the Panthers, and suffered a shock 3-2 defeat against Les Coelacantes in their final group fixture to exit the competition. Addo, who also had coaching stints with Hamburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach, helped the Black Stars to book their place in the World Cup finals set for Qatar after defeating rivals Nigeria on the away goals rule. After the two West African nations settled for a 0-0 draw in the first leg meeting in Kumasi, the Black Stars secured a 1-1 draw in the return leg in Abuja to earn the slot.

Benzema: I dissected everything about Ronaldo's game at Real Madrid to get better,"Karim Benzema has revealed that he studied Cristiano Ronaldo intensely as he looked to learn from the Portugal star at Real Madrid when they were team-mates. Benzema and Ronaldo joined the Spanish side in the same summer, from Lyon and Manchester United respectively. Ronaldo hit the ground running at the Santiago Bernabeu and became an immediate star in the capital, though it took slightly longer for Benzema to reach his top form. The France striker had a slow start to life at Madrid and tried his best to learn from his team-mate to help improve his own game. ""When I watched what he did, I tried to concentrate on his movements: the dribbling, the finishing, the passing, his ball handling, I dissected everything about him,"" Benzema told Onze Mondial.  ""But, then it‚Äôs impossible to achieve the same thing. ""I still have a lot of things in my head. I want to win more titles, more Champions Leagues. And with the national team, the World Cup. That‚Äôs all I have as a dream."" Benzema is coming off the best season of his career, having scored 27 times in La Liga in 2021-22 and an incredible 15 times in the Champions League as Madrid won both competitions. That's a significant improvement from his early struggles at Madrid. He started just 13 of the 27 La Liga matches in which he featured in his first season since making the move from France and struggled to maintain his place in the starting XI. ‚ÄúMy first season, the first six months, were very difficult, as I was alone and I didn‚Äôt speak the language so everything was complicated,"" he reflected.

The Selecao attacker cut into the box during Monday's clash in Japan, with a nifty bit of work showcasing his usual skills, before he appeared to crumple under minimal contract from Genta Miura after the latter lunged wide for the ball. Neymar's theatrics in what was a friendly against a vastly outclassed side drew condemnation across social media. Neymar sold this one pretty well en route to a penalty for PSG. üëÄ pic.twitter.com/Pww5lTqHbn",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-psg-star-neymar-draws-controversial-penalty-pre-season/blt23815b3639612b35,Andrew Steel,9f59e724-9de1-4787-9179-957f7e8b1b4b
Ex-Arsenal defender Gibbs explains converting part of salary to Bitcoin,"Ex-Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs has explained why he has converted part of his current Inter Miami salary to Bitcoin and joined other football players in embracing cryptocurrency investment. Gibbs, now likely in the back-end of his career in MLS, wants to protect his wealth against inflation by putting some of his money in an alternative asset. And while he has resisted telling others to follow his lead, he has suggested he won't be the last to convert his salary to Bitcoin. ""You start from the beginning - before we discovered gold - and you read through history, it just fascinated me,"" Gibbs said to the Daily Mail. ""It's a very powerful technology. ""Without getting too deep, look at how many people in the world don't have access to a bank account. The fact that all you need is internet and a smart phone [for cryptocurrency]. ""Then, you're instantly given access to probably two billion people, to services that obviously we're so used to, but a fifth of the planet aren't. ""If I was to get paid in dollars for the next three years, the way the economy is at the moment, I'm going to lose around 10 per cent of that a year [through inflation]. But my contract doesn't increase."" Gibbs went on to say he likely wouldn't be the last to convert salary to Bitcoin before saying:  ""I would never tell someone what to do. But, by me announcing something, at least it makes people aware. And then they can at least get educated on it."" Converting salary to Bitcoin is a simpler approach to cryptocurrency than many football players have taken. Rather than diving into the murky world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Gibbs has directly invested in a fungible alternative currency. He's far from the first player to receive cryptocurrency benefits, as even Lionel Messi received a cryptocurrency bonus in his Paris Saint-Germain contract last summer. A prominent U.S.-based player representative told GOAL last year that his clients have requested crash courses on cryptocurrency. He said he expects some will become involved in the market in the coming years. So despite massive fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin on a month-to-month basis, Gibbs is likely an early adopter in a trend that will continue in the coming years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-arsenal-defender-gibbs-explains-converting-part-of-salary/blt884b04addf81c362,Dan Bernstein,cece3e3d-5802-4f97-b390-dc604621e3c2
Arsenal agree ¬£3m Marquinhos transfer as Gunners close in on Sao Paulo attacker,"Arsenal have agreed a deal to sign Brazilian winger Marquinhos. The Gunners have been holding extensive talks with Sao Paulo over the 19-year-old during the past week and an agreement has now been reached. Final details still need to be sorted out before the deal can be concluded, but Marquinhos is now expected to be Arsenal‚Äôs first signing of the transfer window. GOAL has been told that the fee for Marquinhos will be around ¬£3 million ($3.7m). Arsenal have taken advantage of a contract loophole to land the forward for such a low price, with Sao Paulo reluctantly having to accept the offer due to fears he could leave for free, despite his current deal not due to expire in 2024. Personal terms are not expected to be an issue. Marquinhos is a talented young forward who mainly operates as a winger -¬†¬†but he can also play through the centre. He is left-footed and is comfortable on either wing, although his preferred role is wide out on the right so he can cut inside on his favoured foot. He broke through into the Sao Paulo side as a 18-year-old, making his debut against Flamengo in July, 2021. üî•üî• ¬°As√≠ cerr√≥ Marquinhos la tercera victoria de @SaoPauloFC en la CONMEBOL #Sudamericana!#LaGranConquista pic.twitter.com/k9oDPOJLBq Marquinhos is being signed as ‚Äòone for the future‚Äô, sources have confirmed to GOAL. Providing the deal goes through without any last minute hitches, he could be given an opportunity to work with the first-team during pre-season. If he impresses he could earn himself a place on the summer tour to the United States. His arrival will not have an impact on Arsenal‚Äôs main summer transfer plans, with the Gunners looking at bringing in two senior attacking stars.

Why is Lionel Messi called 'La Pulga'? PSG star's 'Flea' nickname meaning explained,"Most footballing greats have got their nicknames - Cristiano Ronaldo is known as the 'El Bicho' in Spain, while    Ronaldo de Assis Moreira is more commonly referred to as 'Ronaldinho'.  Similarly, Lionel Messi, who is widely regarded as one of the best footballers to have ever graced the pitch, also has got an interesting moniker - 'La Pulga'. So what does the nickname mean and why is he called it? GOAL takes a look.  One of Messi's most famous nicknames is that of¬†'La Pulga',¬†which means 'the flea' in Spanish.  He has been known by this nickname since he was a kid. It is believed that two of his elder brothers called him 'La Pulgita' (little flea) which later came to be known as 'La Pulga'.   The Rosario native was not one of the biggest kids on the pitch and his small stature earned him the moniker. In fact, Messi had a growth hormone disorder or GHD, treatment for which Barcelona helped to pay for.  Some in the Spanish media would also call him 'La Pulga Atomica' (the atomic flea) as he always had the explosive talent to take on defenders.  Indeed, Messi's considerable upper-body strength has allowed him to physically match his opponents in challenges - while his quick footwork allows him to excel at dribbling. Moreover, due to his height, he has a low centre of gravity which further helps him to keep his balance while he is dribbling or sprinting with the ball.  Messi has quite a few nicknames other than being known as 'La Pulga'. He is fondly called Leo, a shortened form of his full first name that is informally used by football figures, teammates, and pundits alike. It is also supposed that Messi may have been named after singer Lionel Richie, who has produced some immortal tracks like ""Hello"" and Truly"". His fans also refer to him as the ""Messiah"", as he has rescued many Barcelona and Argentina teams at their hour of need.

Tuchel explains why Lukaku hasn't been starting for Chelsea but striker an option to face Arsenal,"Thomas Tuchel has explained why Romelu Lukaku hasn't been starting games for Chelsea recently while revealing that he is ""an option"" to lead the line against Arsenal on Wednesday night. Lukaku returned to Chelsea from Inter in a club-record deal last summer, but has since struggled for consistency under Tuchel. The 28-year-old is still looking for his first Premier League goal of 2022 and is no longer a regular in the Blues' starting XI, with Timo Werner getting the nod ahead of him for their 2-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Crystal Palace on Sunday. Lukaku missed a glorious chance to get on the scoresheet after coming on as a substitute at Wembley, while Werner picked up the man-of-the-match award despite also failing to find the net. The German had scored three times in his previous two appearances, but Tuchel doesn't think that Lukaku needs the push from his team-mate to raise his level, with it his belief that fitness problems have significantly hindered the Belgian's progress. ""I don't think that he needs inspiration. He needs that one moment, that one spark,"" the Chelsea boss told reporters ahead of the Arsenal game. ""I told you that he would normally be a natural starter against Crystal Palace in terms of the number of minutes Kai Havertz has played now and the amount of physicality he has played with recently.  ""Because of the injury, he lacks the fitness of matches. I don't point the finger at him, but it's just like this. It's a crucial part of the season when you need to have rhythm. ""If you see the games against Brentford and Real Madrid, you see the effort we had to put in to become a winning team again. Rom should have had a goal against Real Madrid [in the Champions League], but he is missing the luck. If he starts, we need all he can do physically, but he is always an option."" Lukaku has only been able to record 12 goals in 37 appearances since re-signing for Chelsea, including just five in the Premier League. The 28-year-old was left out of the Blues' 6-0 win away at Southampton on April 9 and had been on the bench for their previous four top-flight matches. Lukaku's last Premier League goal came in a 1-1 draw with Brighton back in December, but he will hope to get the nod when Arsenal arrive at Stamford Bridge in midweek with a view to breaking his duck and going on to finish the season strongly.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-explains-why-lukaku-hasn-t-been-starting-chelsea/blt3d2d3b2037b58403,James Westwood,5099d0d2-64c4-47c8-9fc9-1b825da70a05
Chukwueze blow for Villarreal ahead of La Liga outing away to Levante,"Nigeria winger Samuel Chukwueze will play no part in Villarreal's La Liga outing against Levante on Saturday and remains a doubt for the Champions League outing away to Bayern Munich on Wednesday. The Yellow Submarine will be hoping to get maximum points away to Ciudad Stadium in Valencia to boost their chances of finishing in the European competitions places. However, they will have to engage in this weekend's action without one of their influential players. ""He [[Chukwueze]  will not be available [to play Levante] due to a small muscle injury,"" Villarreal manager Unai Emery revealed in his pre-match interview. The 22-year-old Chukwueze suffered an injury against Ghana on March 25 while playing for the Super Eagles in the first leg of the 2022 World Cup qualifier, a match that eventually ended without a goal. He was replaced after 60 minutes, with Watford attacker Emmanuel Dennis taking his place. The Nigeria technical bench had hoped the Villarreal man will recover in time to be involved in the second leg in Abuja, Nigeria four days later but it was not the case. Chukwueze went on to miss the game, which ended 1-1 and Ghana sealed their place in the World Cup to be held in Qatar from November 21 to December 18. Villarreal have been inconsistent away in the Spanish top-tier and Emery conceded it is a concern that should be addressed. ""That is our challenge to always improve. I am very demanding and self-critical with myself,"" the former Arsenal manager continued. ""We have made a reflection that when the best version of the team does not appear, the level falls. It is a great group and a team that shows its face, but away from home, it's costing us.  ""We have two trajectories, at the beginning and now, but it's true that the team has dropped points in games away that punish us. We want to be a team like the one in the Champions League away, we want to be that team and be competitive in that match against Levante."" Currently, Villarreal are placed seventh on the table with 45 points from the 29 matches they have played.

"Brentford vs Manchester United: Predictions, tips & betting odds","Manchester United head to Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday aiming to record their first win of the new season. The Reds began the campaign in disappointing fashion last weekend going down 2-1 at home to Brighton and face a Brentford team who fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 against Leicester in their curtain raiser. Despite their poor showing a week ago, United are clear favourites to win in west London with bet365 offering an away victory at evens (2.00). The Reds comfortably won both fixtures against the Bees last term and will be confident of claiming their first three points of the new campaign. Thomas Frank's men meanwhile are available at 11/4 (3.75) with the draw priced at 5/2 (3.50). Cristiano Ronaldo started last week's game on the bench, but the 37-year-old should get more playing time on Saturday and is the favourite to break the deadlock at 15/4 (4.75), with Anthony Martial offered at 6/1 (7.00) and Bruno Fernandes at 7/1 (8.00). Brentford's Ivan Toney scored 12 league goals last season, eight of which were the opening strike of the game and the former Newcastle forward is available at 5/1 (6.00) net first. United ended last season with six consecutive away defeats and that form will have to change significantly if the side are to improve on their sixth placed finish. Brentford last season were not overly impressive in front of their own fans although they did beat Arsenal and draw with both Tottenham and Liverpool at the Gtech Community stadium. The hosts should be able to make life uncomfortable for United, particularly given the negative atmosphere surrounding the Manchester club with another poor showing likely to heap plenty of pressure on Erik ten Hag even at this early stage of his tenure. Under 2.5 goals is priced at evens (2.00) and looks like offering decent value for this clash, while backing the draw at half time at 5/4 (2.25) should also appeal.

Afcon 2021: Cech tips Mendy and Senegal to lift title in Cameroon,"Chelsea legend Petr Cech has backed goalkeeper Edouard Mendy to guide Senegal to their first-ever Africa Cup of Nations title in Cameroon. The Lions of Teranga reached the quarter-finals of the competition after beating Cape Verde 2-0 in the Round of 16 with Liverpool forward Sadio Mane and Bamba Dieng of Ligue 1 club Marseille notching the goals at Stade Omnisports de Bafoussam. Writing in his weekly column, Cech suggested the 29-year-old custodian, who recently won the Fifa Best goalkeeper award, will win more trophies this year among them the Afcon title as Senegal are among the favourites. ‚ÄúEdou was named The Best goalkeeper by Fifa and it‚Äôs another great achievement for him,‚Äù Cech wrote on Chelsea's official website. ‚ÄúHe is the first African goalkeeper to win the award, which is amazing, and testament to how well he has done since he came to our club. ‚ÄúHe had an incredible year, winning two trophies, and it reflects his hard work and attitude. It‚Äôs great to see him getting recognition and our other players who made it to the Team of the Year. ‚ÄùThe best thing is Edou can now add more trophies this year. He is at the Africa Cup of Nations now, Senegal are one of the favourites, so he could even win this trophy before he returns to us. ‚ÄúAnd then we have the Club World Cup and the Carabao Cup final to look forward to in a few weeks.

From a meticulous approach to matching clothes: Why Germany always win,"A young Lisa Weiss remembers watching on TV as the Germany men‚Äôs national team made one of their regular trips to Frankfurt, which is customary whenever the country wins something special. They gather on the balcony of city hall with their silverware and show it off to the thousands of fans below who swarm the square to celebrate another national triumph. When Weiss was just 21 years old, she got to do that herself as part of the women‚Äôs national team that reigned supreme at Euro 2009. ‚ÄúYou stand there and you think, ‚ÄòWow, I'm here now! And I'm not watching this on TV!'‚Äù she tells GOAL, still lost for words at times when she replays the moment in her mind. As the goalkeeper recalls watching Die Mannschaft engage in the famous celebration, she is trying to remember the title they had just won in her memory. It‚Äôs fitting that she can‚Äôt put her finger on it, because there have simply been so many. After all, the men‚Äôs team has four World Cup trophies to its name, as well as three European Championships. The women have two World Cups, an incredible eight European titles and an Olympic gold medal. The success doesn‚Äôt stop there, either, as the youth teams have also won 30 major tournaments between them, the most recent of those coming in May when an eighth UEFA Women‚Äôs Under-17 Championship was added to the collection. It‚Äôs no wonder, then, that every Germany team goes into a tournament with a contender tag, even if they‚Äôre not at their absolute best ‚Äì just as the women's team do for this month's Women's Euros.  At the end of the day, winning is what they do. The question is, though, how do they do it? It‚Äôs a simple question, but one with a lot of different answers. Shortly after Germany tasted defeat to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup final, the German Football Association (DFB) introduced its Talent Development Programme, an initiative that would set up almost 400 bases across the country to further develop young players. Over the last 20 years, this programme has been upgraded, tweaked and improved in every way possible, such is the DFB‚Äôs attention to detail.  That trait is one key factor in the association's success. Their meticulous approach is seen in the work it does with academies, amateur clubs and state associations to identify and nurture talent.  Another trait becomes evident while talking to Weiss about her experiences. Over 10 years ago, when the goalkeeper first started representing her country at international level, women‚Äôs football was not in the developed place it is today. And yet she remembers the quantity and quality of the staff around here. There were multiple physios, a full-time doctor, video analysts and more.  Even the presence of a goalkeeper coach may seem trivial, but it has only just started to become commonplace in even the women's game's most progressive countries. For so many years, Germany has been ahead of the curve. It has been forward-thinking and advanced in all that it has done, which is why the team has remained competitive at all levels for an incredible amount of time.  However, many other countries followed their lead and are now reaping the rewards. ‚ÄúWe have reached a decisive turning point ‚Äì we want to raise our training to a new level, as other nations have now not only caught up with us but also overtaken us,‚Äù Joti Chatzialexiou, director of the German national teams, tells GOAL. ‚Äú[As for our winning mentality], we often discuss that we feel we are losing this quality a little bit. This is also a generational development, changing life circumstances. ""But always putting on the scale the qualities for which we are envied around the world is our absolute ambition. ‚ÄúOur teams have always been characterised by outstanding team spirit and the titles, especially with the Under-21 national team, have not always been won by the better individual players, but rather by the better team. We need to retain this strength.  ""However, we also want to develop more players with outstanding skills. Other nations are more successful in this matter than we are.  ""So, this is our aspiration as a great soccer nation: we want to get back to the top of the world!‚Äù That winning mentality is the stand-out trait when you think of Germany. It‚Äôs what gets its teams over the line so often, even when it is not at its best.  Chatzialexiou references the U21s Euros win last summer as a good example. The 2014 World Cup win is another. ‚ÄúWe could only celebrate when we won!‚Äù Weiss laughs, remembering her days in Germany‚Äôs U23 team. ‚ÄúI remember we played the Nordic Cup final against the USA and we lost, and everybody was like, ‚ÄòOkay, but it was still good.' ‚ÄúBut from the coaches, we got the feedback ‚Äì it's not enough for us. We couldn't celebrate and have a drink together because the coaches said, ‚ÄòNo, no, no, we have to win this tournament.' ""We wouldn't accept to lose and this was something that I learned in the national team, definitely.‚Äù It‚Äôs the reason she believes the women have had so much success, too, from her experiences working with one of its best ever teams. The Euro 2009 triumph she enjoyed was Germany‚Äôs fifth in succession. ‚ÄúI think it's the mentality and the drive of, ‚ÄòI want to win every game,'‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe had a coach at the time, Silva Neid, who demanded a lot from the players and a lot from herself. ‚ÄúIt was really the focus on, ‚ÄòI want to win every duel in practice. I want to win every little step.' This, I think, she put in our DNA.  ""We were also demanding a lot from each other. When there was a missed pass or something people would say, ‚ÄòCome on, let's go! What is this?‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúWe trust that intrinsic motivation and being obsessed with success can tip the scales in favour of less talented teams within a match,‚Äù Chatzialexiou adds, noting the DFB‚Äôs emphasis on maintaining that mentality. ‚ÄúTherefore, these elements are enormously important to us.‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes, I felt we need to be a little bit more chill and not to be, I would say, too German ‚Äì because we are very strict,‚Äù Weiss concludes.  ‚ÄúWe are always on time. We have rules over rules over rules ‚Äì in the national team especially. We wear the same clothes. If somebody has different shoes on, you have to pay a fine. ‚ÄúSometimes, it's too much but also, I think these are things where you hold on to and this makes also a little part of your success. Maybe it's crazy for other people. ‚ÄúWhen I see the U.S. women's team, how they go, for example, to have lunch, they are dressed in everything, it doesn't matter. But then you see the Germans like they are in the military!‚Äù she laughs. ‚ÄúWe all look the same. I think this is something that is special for us. I would like to have this a little bit more chill but maybe this is the key also of being successful ‚Äì not only the clothes, but the rules of everything.‚Äù The matching attire might not be the secret to so many consistent and successful German national teams, but it sums up the mindset behind them all. There are things they need to improve to keep up with what is going on around Europe and the world, but while Germany has that mentality, you can never write them off.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-germany-always-win/blt7394b8d26e3e7b7c,Ame√© Ruszkai,aab48b9f-8ccc-4430-99f6-f6660fc26465
'It's been a tough ride' - USMNT ace Pulisic perfectly poised to kickstart Chelsea career at Wembley,"Christian Pulisic's finest run as a Chelsea player ended with a severely damaged hamstring at Wembley Stadium, with Arsenal running out 2-1 winners in the 2020 FA Cup final.¬† The United States international had opened the scoring in that behind-closed-doors contest, making it five goals and four assists in the 11 games which immediately followed 'Project Restart', when football resumed after its pandemic-enforced suspension of play.¬† The injury he sustained interrupted the momentum Pulisic had built up but there are increasing signs that the American is one again building up a head of steam. Indeed, the 23-year-old is in line to start Saturday's Carabao Cup final clash with Liverpool having recently returned to prominence under Thomas Tuchel. Pulisic spent the entirety of Chelsea's Club World Cup semi-final against Al Hilal sitting on the bench but he was brought on just half an hour into the tournament decider due to an injury to Mason Mount and played a further 90 minutes as the Blues beat Palmeiras 2-1 after extra time. Following a positive display in Abu Dhabi, Pulisic started the next two games, scoring the second goal in a 2-0 win over Lille in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at¬†Stamford Bridge.¬† This run of games couldn't have come at a better time for Pulisic. After a difficult spell playing centre forward because of a Covid-19 outbreak in the Chelsea squad, the winger found himself benched for much of the winter.¬† He did start big games against Liverpool and Man City, but he still looked a long way from establishing himself in a competitive front line, having just scored twice in all competitions¬†before January.¬† Indeed, Pulisic hinted at a sense of frustration¬†after linking up with the U.S. men's national team for the most recent round of World Cup qualifiers.¬† ""It's a lot sometimes,"" Pulisic told reporters.¬†""When I come to the national team, it's: 'How are things with Chelsea? What's this? What's that?' ""It's tough. It's definitely played a lot on my mind. Mentally it's been difficult at times. ""But I'm always very excited to come back with the national team and step away and get to enjoy playing with these guys and get to just enjoying football in general."" He was back in the doldrums again, though, after being left out against Al Hilal, admitting in an interview with ESPN: ""I was very ready to play. I wanted to play. So, of course, I was upset that I didn't. ""There have been a lot of ups and downs. I have been on and off playing, different positions, kind of being moved around.  ""It has been a tough ride for me personally, to be honest, and I am just trying to get back into some rhythm, get into the run of things."" When pressed on his relationship with Tuchel, he effectively admitted they didn't always see eye to eye. ""You are not always going to get along the best or whatever, but I think we have had a good enough relationship where we've been able to  accomplish things together and I've been able to play at times,"" he explained.""Now, I'm  hoping to get back on that streak."" His downbeat tone was certainly understandable, given he had played fewer minutes than any of the Blues' other forwards at that point.  Even after starting against Lille, while he moved ahead of Timo Werner in terms of game time, he remains behind the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech. It also obviously grates that he's not always been allowed to play in his preferred position.  During that hot streak after 'Project Restart', Pulisic was being deployed on the left wing. This season, though, he's been moved all over the pitch to accommodate others. However, after injuries to Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi¬†and Hakim Ziyech of late, the door has opened again for Pulisic.¬† ""After his performance in the Club World Cup final, Christian deserves to stay in the team,""¬†Tuchel told Chelsea's Fifth Stand app.¬†""So, let's see if we decide it should be like this."" Pulisic certainly isn't the only forward to have struggled under Tuchel this season, Werner, Romelu Lukaku and Kai Havertz all having low goal tallies.¬† The American still has a long way to go to match the impact of the forwards at both Liverpool and Manchester City, and show himself capable of sustaining a Chelsea title challenge. However, he is full fit, on form, back in the starting line-up and now has a perfect chance to use Wembley to regain the momentum he lost at the same venue two years ago.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-ace-pulisic-perfectly-poised-kickstart-chelsea-career/bltc82473f3281545dd,Nizaar Kinsella,6c7346f7-5a97-4dff-863e-02b9c3184c38
Buck steps down as Chelsea chairman after 18-trophy tenure as Boehly era takes shape at Stamford Bridge,"Chelsea have announced that Bruce Buck will ‚Äì in the wake of the Todd Boehly-led consortium taking the reins at Stamford Bridge - be stepping down from his role as club chairman, with a 19-year tenure whih delivered 18 trophies to be brought to a close. The American lawyer, who has formed part of the Blues‚Äô boardroom since 2003, will be moving into a senior advisory role with the Premier League heavyweights from June 30. During his time at the helm, which has also seen the club‚Äôs women‚Äôs side land 12 pieces of silverware, while Chelsea have become a ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs elite football clubs and a globally recognised brand followed by millions"". Explaining his decision on the Blues‚Äô official website, Buck said: ‚ÄúI am proud to have helped Chelsea realise great success on the pitch and make a positive impact in the community. ‚ÄúNow is the right time to step down and let new ownership build on the strong foundations we have in place. ‚ÄúThe owners have a compelling vision for Chelsea‚Äôs future, and I look forward to helping them achieve it in this new role alongside our incredible staff, players, coaches and supporters.‚Äù Boehly, co-controlling owner of Chelsea following a takeover in west London that saw Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich sever ties with the club, added on Buck: ‚ÄúBruce has led Chelsea to the highest levels of international and domestic football, while also developing one of the most active social responsibility projects in sport. We thank Bruce for his service and his commitment to the club.‚Äù Buck's departure comes amid a time of huge flux at Chelsea, with Guy Laurence also leaving his role as SEO while director Eugene Tenenbaum has been sanctioned due to his financial connections with Russia. Bruce Buck to step down as Chairman of Chelsea Football Club. GOAL's Chelsea correspondent Nizaar Kinsella writes: Buck was a divisive figure among Chelsea supporters. His legacy includes the more negative side of his 20 years at the top: which includes trying to buy the land that Stamford Bridge sits on from Chelsea fans, while he also played an active role in the formation of the Super League.  However, he also sat as the chair of the Chelsea Foundation which won a host of awards for giving back within football.  Before the Super League debacle, he was also one of the most influential chairmen in the Premier League. He lives close to Chelsea and clearly loves the club.  He'll likely continue to be invited into the director's box and remains on the payroll as an advisor. Chelsea won the Premier League title for the first time in 2004-05, with Jose Mourinho‚Äôs appointment as manager ushering in a new era for the Blues. They have claimed a further four top-flight crowns since then, while in cup competitions Chelsea have won the FA Cup on five occasions since 2003. The League Cup has been captured three times and the Community Shield twice. Success in Europe has delivered Champions League crowns in 2012 and 2021, with the Europa League trophy lifted in 2013 and 2019. The UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup were both secured in 2021 on the back of the Blues‚Äô last triumph in continental competition.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/buck-steps-down-chelsea-chairman-boehly/blt877a2b31c53c6b17,Chris Burton,6f7fc2aa-d836-4209-9aea-6e1324bec74b
West Ham's Zouma avoids jail but banned from keeping cats for five years over abuse video,"West Ham defender Kurt Zouma has avoided jail over the viral video that showed him kicking and slapping a cat, but has been sentenced to community service and banned from keeping the animal for five years. Disturbing footage of Zouma abusing a cat that was posted on his brother Yoan's Snapchat account was widely circulated online in February, prompting an RSPCA investigation. The France international subsequently had his two male Bengal cats taken away from him and was later hit with three charges under the Animal Welfare act. Zouma pled guilty to two counts of causing ""unnecessary suffering"" to a cat at Thames Magistrates Court last week, and was also up on a separate breach of animal welfare duty charge. The 27-year-old was formally sentenced on June 1, with District Judge Susan Holdham handing him 180 hours of community service. Yoan, meanwhile, was also hit with two charges and received 140 hours of community service, and both men have been banned from keeping cats for the next five years. Ms Holdham¬†said that the brothers had expressed ""genuine remorse"" for their actions. She was, however, damning in her assessment of their treatment of the cat, as she added: ""Both of you took part in this disgraceful and reprehensible act with this pet cat. ""The cat looked up to you to care for its needs. On that date in February you did not provide for its needs."" Zouma's two cats have been signed over to be rehomed, while West Ham have yet to confirm whether the centre-half will face any suspension from football after the final verdict.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/west-ham-s-zouma-avoids-jail-but-banned-from-keeping-cats/blt16aeab8c1a797187,James Westwood,39be8808-c07d-431f-851c-c978bdd0404c
Liverpool eyeing another Champions League final after Henderson & Mane break down Villarreal's 'Yellow Wall',"Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Match Statistics Two minutes and eight seconds. That was all it took to turn a sticky night into a spectacular one for Liverpool. They‚Äôre not there yet, but Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side are now overwhelming favourites to reach their third Champions League final in five seasons, after seeing off Villarreal 2-0 in their semi-final, first leg at Anfield on Wednesday night. Quick-fire strikes from Jordan Henderson and Sadio Mane did the damage for the Reds, who, for 45 minutes, had looked as if they might find Villarreal‚Äôs ‚ÄòYellow Wall‚Äô as puzzling and as frustrating as Juventus and Bayern Munich had before them. Those two giants had fallen, but it would be a surprise if Liverpool were to go the same way now, even if they still have to finish the job in Spain next week. This was a convincing, dominant performance from Klopp‚Äôs men, who still have that unprecedented quadruple firmly within their sights. Unai Emery sent his side to annoy, but the gulf in quality between the two sides was evident throughout. Liverpool‚Äôs biggest annoyance, in fact, will be that they didn‚Äôt finish the tie here. They certainly had the chances to do so. That nutmeg assist from Mohamed Salah üòà pic.twitter.com/gT0xK3luwS In the end, a two-goal cushion will do them. It came courtesy of a piece of good fortune, Henderson‚Äôs clipped cross from the right drifting over the head of Geronimo Rulli, the Villarreal goalkeeper, and into the net, and from a piece of elite attacking quality, Mo Salah finding the perfect pass for Mane, who found the perfect finish for 2-0. Emery‚Äôs side looked shell-shocked. They had conceded only two goals in four games against Juve and Bayern, but suddenly they had shipped two in the blink of an eye, Liverpool‚Äôs relentless intensity too much even for a team designed to, in the words of their manager, ‚Äúsuffer without the ball‚Äù for long periods. They certainly did that here. Liverpool had almost three-quarters possession, took 19 shots and forced 10 corners. Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk spent more time in the Villarreal half than in their own, while Alisson Becker was a spectator for the most part. Safe to say, it wasn‚Äôt the ding-dong we saw at the Etihad on Tuesday night. African players with the most Champions League knockout goals:Sadio Mane - 14 üá∏üá≥Didier Drogba - 14 üá®üáÆ pic.twitter.com/kPz25Lg9mL The result, though, is what is important, and Liverpool will certainly be backed to finish the job in six days‚Äô time, even if they must first negotiate a tricky Premier League trip to Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime. They had all the quality here, the tone set by Thiago Alcantara‚Äôs probing and Luis Diaz‚Äôs pressing. What a pair of signings those two are turning out to be, players of pedigree and desire and class. Throw in Mane, who again led the line superbly, and Salah, who didn‚Äôt score but created havoc with Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold on the right, and you have a potent combination. The night finished as it had started, with The Beatles playing on the Anfield PA system. It was ‚ÄòYellow Submarine‚Äô before kick-off, a nice touch given the opposition, but it was a different tune being belted out by the end. ‚ÄòI Feel Fine‚Äô has become the soundtrack to Liverpool‚Äôs season, and no wonder. They're so glad, that Jurgen is a red, and come the end of next month, these fans, and this team, could have everything they ever dreamed of.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-champions-league-final-henderson-mane-break-down/blt17e01f0bc4a305d9,Neil Jones,e0a4dba4-85a4-4a62-9637-41e71aa6c569
Dirty Arsenal or referee bias - Are the Gunners really the Premier League's bad boys?,"When Gabriel Martinelli was shown a red card at Wolves last Thursday, he became the 12th Arsenal player to be sent off in the Premier League since Mikel Arteta was appointed manager in December 2019. No other team in the English top flight has had more than seven players dismissed during the same time frame. But are Arsenal really the league's dirtiest team? Or are they being unfairly targeted by officials because of a perceived propensity for ill-discipline? After Martinelli had become the fourth Gunner to be dismissed since the turn of the year, Arteta argued that his players are being hard done by. ‚ÄúYou ask me if I am happy with the decisions that we have had this season ‚Äì I am not at all,‚Äù the Spaniard told reporters. ‚ÄúBut that is a conversation that I will have with the officials privately. ‚ÄúWe need explanations. We need explanations for things that happened with VAR and I need an explanation for what happened [against Wolves]. ‚Äú[Those conversations] are going to happen soon.‚Äù When you explore the statistics behind Arsenal‚Äôs poor disciplinary record under Arteta, it is easy to see why he feels they are being harshly treated. Since his first game in charge, away at Bournemouth on Boxing Day 2019, Arsenal have committed 785 fouls in the Premier League and been shown 12 red cards.  That‚Äôs a red card on average once every 65.4 fouls committed. In contrast, Burnley have committed 804 fouls during the same time frame and have yet to be shown a single red. Liverpool, meanwhile, have had just one player sent off despite committing 820 fouls, Manchester United have had three red cards from 934 fouls and Tottenham have seen three players dismissed from 908 fouls. Of course, the number of fouls a team commits does not directly correlate with the number of red cards, as it all depends on the individual incident that leads to the referee taking action.¬† But what the numbers do show, at least, is that Arsenal are far from a dirty side. Of all the teams who have remained constant¬†in the Premier League since Arteta was appointed, only Manchester City (756) have made fewer fouls than Arsenal‚Äôs 785. So, the Gunners do not give away many free-kicks. It‚Äôs just that when they do, they tend to get admonished with far greater regularity than other teams. For example, since Arteta replaced Emery at the Emirates, Liverpool have picked up a card, either yellow or red, once every 8.91 fouls. Arsenal, though, are averaging a card every 5.73 fouls. So, it‚Äôs easy to see why many Gunners fans are frustrated, believing it's a classic case of one rule for them, and another rule for everybody else. While their players seem to be seeing red for relatively minor infringements, other teams appear to be escaping severe sanction for far worse misdemeanours. Think of Ben Godfrey‚Äôs stamp on Takehiro Tomiyasu's face during the game at Goodison Park. Somehow the Everton defender was allowed to stay on the pitch ‚Äì even after a VAR check. Crystal Palace‚Äôs James McArthur volleyed Bukayo Saka during the home draw with Crystal Palace and escaped with just a yellow card, while in the meeting with Manchester City on New Year's Day, Martin Odegaard was denied a penalty after being tripped by Ederson ‚Äì only for City to then be awarded a spot-kick of their own when Bernardo Silva went down after a tussle with Granit Xhaka. All of these incidents have led to a real sense of injustice at Arsenal, but while the players have every right to feel wronged at times, they also have to accept some responsibility for their actions. Gabriel Magalhaes lost his head against Manchester City and was shown two yellow cards in as many minutes following the penalty decision. It was a red card that could have been avoided, as was Xhaka‚Äôs at Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg, when he was sent for a professional foul on Diogo Jota. Thomas Partey was dismissed in the return game, again for amassing two yellow cards in a short space of time. The first booking may have been debatable, but he was extremely naive to dive in again soon after his first caution. All three of those reds were needless. The same goes for Martinelli‚Äôs at Wolves, even if Arsenal could point to similar examples in the past that have not led to players being booked twice for two incidents during the same passage of play. ‚ÄúWe know that playing with 10 men in this league we‚Äôre not going to get the points that we want,‚Äù Arteta admitted after the victory at Molineux. ‚ÄúWe have to stop it.¬† ‚ÄúBut, to be fair, it‚Äôs difficult to find more arguments and more ways to transmit that to the players.¬† ‚ÄúEverybody says it‚Äôs the most disciplined group they‚Äôve seen in the last 15 years, but we are getting red cards for other things.‚Äù Of the 12 red cards Arsenal have been shown under Arteta in the league, just three have been straight dismissals for bad tackles.¬† There have been two for violent conduct ‚Äì Nicolas Pepe against Leeds and Xhaka against Burnley ‚Äì while the rest were either for two yellow cards, professional fouls or deliberate handballs. So, it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs not really a case of 'Dirty Arsenal' when it comes to Arteta‚Äôs side, and they have had justifiable reason to feel as if they have been the victims of some poor calls. However, they must also do what they can to avoid some of the needless red cards they have been shown over the past two years. If they don‚Äôt, then their hopes of a top-four finish this season could come to a similarly frustrating early end.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dirty-arsenal-or-referee-bias-are-the-gunners-really-the-premier-/blta135519f3b22e4b9,Charles Watts,8b185ec7-3234-41eb-be94-c538fd8b3f91

Man City unveil Aguero statue on 10th anniversary of ‚Äò93:20‚Äô Premier League title-winning goal against QPR,"Manchester City have unveiled a Sergio Aguero statue outside their Etihad Stadium home on the 10th anniversary of the Argentine striker‚Äôs famous Premier League title-clinching goal against Queens Park Rangers. Said strike was recorded in the 94th minute of a final day fixture that saw the Blues battle back from two goals down to pip arch-rivals Manchester United to a domestic crown in dramatic fashion under the management of Roberto Mancini. Aguero would go on to become the club‚Äôs all-time leading marksman across 10 memorable years in English football, and a permanent reminder of his efforts has now been put in place alongside monuments recognising the achievements of his former team-mates Vincent Kompany and David Silva. We are delighted to unveil a permanent statue of Club legend @aguerosergiokun at the Etihad Stadium on the tenth anniversary of 93:20! üíô#ManCity pic.twitter.com/NUoyPyAMBm The Argentine frontman, who joined City from Atletico Madrid in 2011, hit 260 goals for the Blues through 390 appearances. None were more memorable than the one registered after 93 minutes and 20 seconds of a showdown with QPR that allowed a first Premier League title of the Sheikh Mansour era to be secured. In total, Aguero would claim 15 major honours while on the books at the Etihad Stadium ‚Äì including five top-flight crowns, one FA Cup and six League Cups. City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has told the club‚Äôs official website of the legacy left behind by a modern day superstar: ‚ÄúSergio Aguero‚Äôs contribution to Manchester City in a defining era for the club cannot be overstated. He is without doubt one of the greatest players that has ever played the game. ‚ÄúWhen our fans think of Sergio, they are immediately drawn to the iconic moment of 93:20 and the goal that secured the Club‚Äôs first league title in 44 years, but as his record of 260 goals for the Club demonstrates, his legacy and impact at Manchester City go far beyond that. ‚ÄúIt is only fitting that Sergio has been recognised with a statue of his own, in celebration and honour of his accomplishments in one of the most important chapters of Manchester City‚Äôs rich and long history.‚Äù When Sergio Aguero won Manchester City the title with this üòçThe greatest Premier League moment of all time? ü§§pic.twitter.com/XL6Gp1EI1T The 33-year-old, who was forced to retire due to a heart condition shortly after leaving City for Barcelona as a free agent in the summer of 2021, has said of being immortalised in Manchester: ‚ÄúTruthfully, it is a very beautiful thing for me, to see myself 10 years ago is very moving. ‚ÄúIn those 10 years I was able to win a lot of trophies and was able to help the club become one of the most important in the world. ‚ÄúI am very grateful to the club for making this statue in recognition of my football career in Manchester.

"Kalou: Ex-Chelsea forward talks up Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa‚Äôs Afcon 2023 chances","Salomon Kalou has tipped Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations billed for Cote d‚ÄôIvoire. The former Cote d‚ÄôIvoire and Chelsea forward as well as Lucas Radebe assisted the Confederation of African Football director of competitions Samson Adamu during the draw ceremony held on Tuesday evening in Johannesburg, South Africa.¬† The pairings served up plenty of interesting match-ups as 32 teams are expected to make it to the West African country in 2023. Nigeria will face Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe in Group A, and the 36-year-old is confident that the three-time African kings will stroll past their foes. ‚ÄúI think it is a good group [for the Super Eagles]. I think Nigeria is a team that will always qualify,‚Äù Kalou said on SuperSport after the draw. ‚ÄúThey will be the favourites of the group while the second place is open for the other three teams.‚Äù Having missed the last edition held in Cameroon, South Africa are hoping to return to Afcon, albeit, they must do well against Morocco, Zimbabwe and Libya in Group K. Notwithstanding the presence of the Atlas Lions and Warriors, Kalou has no doubts that the 1996 African kings will be making their 11th appearance at the biennial African football fiesta. The same sentiment he shared about defending champions Lions of Teranga who have been zoned in Group L with Benin Republic, Mozambique and Rwanda. ‚ÄúBafana Bafana are a strong team, they need to come back to the frontline now. I think they are capable of qualifying from this group,‚Äù he added. There are no easy games but I think it‚Äôs going to be easy for Senegal. They are the defending champions and I feel they will go through. ‚ÄúFor Benin Republic, Rwanda and Mozambique, it is going to be 50-50.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Elephants will try Zambia, Comoros and Lesotho for size even though they have already secured their place in the tournament which means only one other team from their group will qualify for the competition. Even with their temporary suspension by Fifa, Kenya and Zimbabwe will take part in the qualifiers. Notwithstanding if the suspension is not lifted two weeks before their first matchday of the qualifiers, both associations will be considered losers and eliminated from the competition. With Cote d'Ivoire 2023 scheduled to be held from 23 June to 23 July 2023, the 32 teams expected to participate will be known in September 2022 and will have enough time to get ready for their opponents and to fine-tune their preparations.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kalou-ex-chelsea-forward-talks-up-nigeria-senegal-and-south/blt0168d0d929c8b6bd,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,fc718215-e9ce-4a3e-bd3e-83702c825019

Why Gabriel Jesus' Man City career has reached a crossroads,"Gabriel Jesus returns to the scene of his most famous Manchester City goal this weekend. Back in 2018, the Brazilian emulated his mentor Sergio Aguero by scoring an injury-time winner on the final day of the season to clinch a victory with virtually the last kick of the season. His 94th-minute goal at Southampton didn't secure the Premier League title ‚Äì that had been claimed more than a month earlier. However, Jesus' strike at St Mary's saw City finish the 2017-18 campaign on 100 points, thus earning a place in the history books for one of the greatest Premier League teams of all time. Jesus's cool, lobbed finish sparked wild scenes as he ripped off his shirt to celebrate in front of the away fans, flanked by his team-mates and the substitutes that had sprinted down the touchline to join in, while Pep Guardiola punched the sky in delight. A supreme season of utter dominance was finished off with a worthy exclamation mark. ""Maybe this record will be broken but it will be difficult,"" Guardiola said. In the tunnel, a 21-year-old Jesus was so excited by his late winner that he started his post-match interview speaking in English before bursting into laughter and reverting back to his native Portuguese. ""I was blessed to score that goal but thanks to all the team for their great work,"" he said. Three years on and he now speaks fluently, and often with absorbing honesty, in English. He remains just as quick, though, to thank his team-mates for any individual recognition which comes his way. However, there is concern now over how much his career has kicked on since that magical moment at Southampton. Just like Raheem Sterling, he has 18 months remaining on his contract and sorting his future out is a priority. Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan are also out of contract in 2023 but both will be 32 by that stage. Jesus, however, will be 27 and should be reaching the prime of his career. He has always had plenty of suitors. Juventus have been regularly proposed as a possible destination while Serie A champions Inter were also linked last summer.  However, there have also been suggestions that his wage demands would be too high for the top Italian clubs. For now, Jesus remains a part of Pep Guardiola's plans, having started more than half of City's Premier League matches this season and appeared in 22 of their 28 league and Champions League games ‚Äì missing two because of Covid-19 regulations. A summer pursuit of a striker is also unlikely to impact on his future, with a decision made at the start of the season to deploy him more regularly as a winger. The change of position has worked effectively, with only Joao Cancelo contributing more assists this term, and Jesus admits he prefers to play without the added pressure of being the main goalscorer. City's goals are spread around, with 18 different scorers already this season, and Jesus is part of a menacing attacking unit in which seven players have contributed five goals or more. The position always seemed a good fit as proved by his iconic match-winning performances home and away to Real Madrid in the 2019-2020 Champions League campaign. ""I have played [as a winger] with the national team for two years,"" he said in October.  ""I started to play in the first team of Palmeiras as a winger as well and I played sometimes when I arrived here as a winger as well. So, I think I'm okay there. ""I can make runs in behind, control the ball, make passes, make crosses, help defend, so it's all good and suits my game."" But there is an incessant battle for starting places at City and Jesus doesn't always prevail. During last season's run to the Champions League final, he didn't feature in any of Guardiola's starting line-ups after the round of 16 first-leg victory over Borussia Monchengladbach, in which he scored. Intense competition for places will always be the norm, though, at a club like City, who will always strive to have the strongest squad possible in order to compete for the game's biggest trophies every season. This feels like a good time for him to take stock, though. Exactly five years ago this week, Jesus made his City debut in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham in which he was denied a late winner by a narrow offside decision. Joining midway through the season, he finished with seven goals from 11 appearances after a metatarsal fracture disrupted his campaign. Aguero's side in the place came seriously under threat and it was perhaps the Argentine who learned the most from their rivalry, as it forced him to increase his pressing and general work-rate. Most strikers would struggle to match Aguero's remarkable strike-rate, of course, and 88 goals from 219 appearances is still a good return from Jesus' time in Manchester. ""Today I complete five years wearing Man City's jersey. Happy and proud to be part of the history of this club. Come on, City!"" he proudly posted on social media this week. Jesus is clearly still enjoying his Etihad experience but, with his contract expiring, his future at the club remains shrouded in uncertainty.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gabriel-jesus-man-city-career-crossroads/bltcc5c71b16e7ae63a,Jonathan Smith,2d4a13de-832c-4b62-9de9-22725828c9a0
Will Man Utd sign Antony? Ajax boss ready to fight Ten Hag to stop transfer happening,"Ajax manager Alfred Schreuder is determined to keep Manchester United from raiding his club this summer. Schreuder said it's important that the Dutch organisation hold onto Red Devils target Antony, as well as defender Jurrien Timber. Manchester United hired Erik ten Hag away from Ajax and are hopeful the head coach can bring stars with him to Old Trafford. ""It is clear that we want to keep that boy,"" Schreuder told ESPN. ""I think he still has a contract until 2025. ""I really want to work with him; he knows that, and the club knows that too."" On Timber, he added: ""I think this guy is very smart. He knows very well what is good for himself to develop. And I don't think he's finished at Ajax."" Despite Schreuder's objections, Antony is eager to join Manchester United this summer. His 10 goals and nine assists in all competitions this past term kept him near the top of the list of Europe's most sought after attackers, and the dream of joining a bigger league ahead of the 2022 World Cup is proving irresistible. But Ajax will do their best to convince him to stay at least one more season. Midfield is their top priority this window, and they have narrowed their focus to Frenkie de Jong and Christian Eriksen. Full-back is another area Ten Hag could look to bolster, though that's considered lower in importance than attacking and midfield reinforcements.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/will-man-utd-sign-antony-ajax-transfer-boss-ready-to-fight/blt878ffd2e8133baf9,Dan Bernstein,6d9ac6ff-db4b-4bc6-bf8f-5bb70ae04323
"How many South American teams qualify for World Cup 2022? Brazil, Argentina & the route to Qatar","With qualification for World Cup 2022 still underway, the competition and its participants have started to take shape, with more teams starting to be confirmed. Only two CONMEBOL teams have already directly qualified for the World Cup finals, with a few qualifying spots still up for grabs ‚Äì so how many South American teams are able to compete in the 2022 World Cup? GOAL takes a look. CONMEBOL will have either four or five teams competing in the 2022 World Cup. The top four teams qualify directly for the World Cup, while the fifth-placed team advances to the inter-confederation play-offs. Inter-confederation play-offs are contested at the end of the qualification phase to determine how many teams from each confederation will end up competing in the 2022 finals. CONMEBOL qualifying takes place from October 2020 to June 2022. The inter-confederation play-off takes place in June and will pit the fifth-placed CONMEBOL finisher against the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) fourth round winner. Brazil and Argentina have qualified directly for the World Cup following their first and second-placed finishes, respectively, in Conmebol qualifying. Neymar's Brazil were the first South American nation to qualify for the finals after beating Colombia 1-0 in November 21, cementing their status as the only country to have reached every World Cup so far. Argentina¬†qualified later that same month through a draw against Brazil and a Chile defeat to Ecuador. This means that Conmebol have two more places left for direct qualification, and a potential fifth spot if the fifth-placed team manages to register victory in the inter-confederation play-off.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-many-south-american-teams-qualify-for-world-cup-2022/bltdafd11ea943c782a,Cady Siregar,9d0ad2af-0d5c-47b4-9af5-5e57d339685b
Good news for Pogba! Juventus midfielder avoids surgery after pre-season injury,"Paul Pogba will not have to undergo surgery for a knee injury suffered during the Juventus pre-season. Still, he is set for a spell on the sidelines after developing an issue in his lateral meniscus that knocked him out of the club's tour of the United States. Pogba is set to miss at least the first few weeks of the Serie A season to heal and undergo treatment. He re-joined Juventus from Manchester United on a free transfer earlier this summer. Rather than undergoing surgery, Pogba will now begin a five-week program to prepare for his now-delayed Juventus return. The Frenchman will undergo conservative therapy aimed at shortening recovery times, with the first part of that recovery coming via gym and pool rehab. The second part will then see him return to the pitch as he will prepare individually for an eventual return to the field. Juventus are set to open their season on August 15 with a match against Sassuolo in a clash Pogba will miss. Injury aside, Turin is buzzing at the return of a man who helped the club to Serie A domination in his first stint. While Pogba may not have felt appreciated at Manchester United, he has certainly received abundant love at Juventus. ""Paul is back in Turin,"" wrote the club when his move was announced. ""He left as a boy and returns as a man and a champion, but there is one thing that has not changed - the desire to write unforgettable pages of club history together once more. Pogba is back and we couldn‚Äôt be happier.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pogba-juventus-midfielder-avoids-surgery-after-pre-season/blt0621f82d21ee7fbf,Ryan Tolmich,2805dddd-0c0b-47ae-9a17-1606f123de15
"Barcelona's title-winning women's team are an example for the men's team, says Xavi","Xavi has admitted that Barcelona's title-winning women's team are an example for the men's team. Barcelona Femeni secured their third successive Primera Division crown after thrashing Real Madrid in the Clasico on Sunday. In stark contrast, the men's Blaugrana side have not won La Liga since 2018-19 and are way off the pace in this season's title race, with Xavi acknowledging that the women are ""showing us the way"". Barca Women clinched the trophy with six games to spare while extending their 100 per cent record in 2021-22 with a 24th successive victory. Jonatan Giraldez's team have also scored 136 goals while shipping just six at the other end, and Xavi now ranks them among the best groups in the club's history. ""For several years [the women's team] have been showing us the way with how they play, how they compete and the hunger they have despite winning everything last year,"" the Spanish head coach told reporters. ""We have been watching them and it's a wonder to see them play. They are leading the way in the same way as the Dream Team did in their day or as Pep [Guardiola's] Barca side did later. They are an example for the men's team."" Barca's senior men's team have suffered early exits in both the Champions League and Copa del Rey, with Ronald Koeman axed from the managerial hot seat back in October due to the club's poor start. The Blaugrana's fortunes have improved quickly under Xavi, though, as a club legend has publicly expressed his determination to restore the team's lost identity. Progress has been made in the Europa League, and a place in the quarter-finals is awaiting Barca if they can bounce back from a 0-0 draw in the first leg of their round of 16 tie against Galatasaray when they meet again in Turkey on Thursday.

Chelsea owner Abramovich's associates sanctioned by UK government as up to ¬£10bn in assets frozen,"Two longtime business associates of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich have been sanctioned by the UK government, with up to ¬£10 billion in assets frozen. The government has referred to the move towards Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich as the largest asset freeze in UK history. It's a continuation of the UK targetting those with ties to Russia President Vladimir Putin, who is overseeing an invasion of Ukraine that has drawn scorn from the West. ""We are tightening the ratchet on Putin's war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine,"" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. ""Nothing and no one is off the table."" The Chelsea owner himself has already been sanctioned by the UK government, leading him to put the club up for sale in a process that is still ongoing. For a time, the sanctions limited ticket and merchandise sales, however those aspects have since been amended. As the Chelsea sale process occurs, Abramovich has stepped away from all leadership responsibilities.

USMNT's Berhalter on Pulisic's improved Chelsea form: He can be the leader we expect him to be,"U.S. men's national team boss Gregg Berhalter reflected on Christian Pulisic's ""rollercoaster"" season so far at Chelsea while calling on the winger to be the leader the team needs heading into the final round of World Cup qualifiers. The U.S. heads into matches against Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica with its fate in its own hands as it looks to avoid missing out on a second consecutive World Cup. Berhalter's team enters camp with Pulisic in great form and the USMNT boss believes a confident Pulisic could be vital to the team's hopes this window. ""It's been a pleasure to watch,"" Berhalter said, ""and, I say this all the time, when I was asked about it last camp, I said it's a rollercoaster, especially when you're in a club like Chelsea. When you're at these massive clubs, it's very, very difficult.  ""All they ask him to do is just to keep fighting, keep working and wait for his opportunity and he's done that and he's taken advantage of it. He's become again an important part of their team. He's shown that he can step up and score goals and make assists. ""He's got a great knack for arriving in the penalty box and he's got a finishing touch too. He's very good when he's in front of goal.  ""So for us, we expect very similar things. He needs to keep arriving in the box because we know, when he gets in good positions, he scores, and just continue to focus on the basics and be the leader that we expect him to be."" While Pulisic entered January camp struggling for form, the Chelsea star is in a much better place this time around. He's scored three goals in his nine appearances since the last round of qualifiers, with two of those goals coming in the Champions League against Lille. As always, Pulisic is expected to be a key part of the USMNT squad, although the U.S. has plenty of options on the wing with the return of Gio Reyna.

'Players are waiting to join us' - Galtier expecting more PSG transfers before window closes,"WHAT HAPPENED? The PSG manager mentioned that some players might leave the club in the ongoing transfer window and some new signings might be completed before the window closes.  WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to reporters ahead of their clash against Monaco, Galtier said, ""It will change a lot during the last days of the transfer window. Players are in the process of leaving, others are waiting to join us. We'll see how it will end. We have identified the positions in which we must strengthen ourselves, take players who will add values, but whether it will be done or not, I don't know."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Earlier in the window, Neymar was linked with a move to Chelsea but the deal did not materialise.

'Like he's playing Playstation' - Evra criticises Guardiola management style & says he's glad he was never coached by Man City boss,"Patrice Evra has criticised Pep Guardiola‚Äôs management style, accusing the Manchester City boss of being overbearing and expressing his relief that he never played under the Catalan. The former Manchester United defender says Guardiola ‚Äútakes away your responsibilities‚Äù as a player as if he is ‚Äúplaying on the Playstation‚Äù. Evra added that by giving his players so much information, they struggle to adapt or change tactics when things do not go their way. Speaking to Amazon Prime Video about Guardiola‚Äôs management style, Evra said: ""I have a lot of respect for Guardiola but I'm glad I never had him as a coach, because he takes away your responsibilities, I was talking to Clarence [Seedorf], you have the impression that he is playing on the Playstation. ""He tells you everything you need to do. I remember that [Thierry] Henry, for example, when he was at Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãGuardiola told him to stay wide, but Henry came inside to do one-two with [Lionel] Messi, he scored and after the first half Guardiola put him on the bench, he took him out, just because he didn't respect his directives.‚Äù Last week‚Äôs dramatic defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final means Guardiola‚Äôs quest to lift the famous trophy as City boss will extend into a seventh season. The former Barcelona coach, who last lifted the Champions League with the Liga giants in 2011, is often accused of overthinking his tactics in big European matches. Evra says that character flaw leads to tactical inflexibility and a failure to adjust when games don't go as planned. The former France full-back compared Guardiola‚Äôs approach to that of his former Red Devils mentor Sir Alex Ferguson, who he says gave more responsibility to the players. ""So yes a great coach, but you have to be careful when you give so much information,‚Äù said Evra. ‚ÄúWe also saw him on the bench before the [Real Madrid] game, it seems like there are 20 people in his head, his brain is already burning, it's incredible. ""There is no plan-B. When they are in trouble, what do they do? They look at the bench, they don't take their responsibilities.

Pulisic: I can learn a lot from Liverpool star Salah,"Christian Pulisic says he can learn a lot from Mohamed Salah, with the Chelsea star describing the Liverpool forward as ""up there with the best"" ahead of their Carabao Cup final date. Thomas Tuchel's Blues face Jurgen Klopp's Reds at Wembley on Sunday with the first major domestic honour of the season up for grabs. Both Pulisic and Salah are expected to play key roles for their respective clubs as they face off in London - and the USMNT international has nothing but praise when it comes to his opponent this weekend. ""He is an incredible player,"" Pulisic told ESPN. ""As far as the Premier League goes this season, he has generally been up there with the best.

De Jong transfer: Man Utd target set for crunch Barcelona future talks as Laporta confirms bids for midfielder,"Barcelona have received offers for Frenkie de Jong, club president Joan Laporta has confirmed, but no deal has been done for the Dutch midfielder amid ongoing talk of Manchester United pushing to get a transfer completed. For now, La Liga giants continue to embrace the Netherlands international‚Äôs presence in their plans. Financial difficulties at Camp Nou mean that sales are essential this summer, but there is no guarantee that De Jong will form part of that process as further discussions are being planned when it comes to his future intentions. Laporta has maintained throughout a long-running saga that Barca have no desire to part with De Jong, and that remains the official line coming out of Catalunya as Premier League heavyweights at Old Trafford struggle to put an agreement in place. ‚ÄúFrenkie is our player, we really like him,‚Äù Laporta has told ESPN when asked for an update on the 25-year-old‚Äôs future. ‚ÄúWe received some offers for Frenkie but we didn‚Äôt accept as of now, as we want to talk with him and know exactly what he wants.

That could be a long-term option for player and club heading forward, with Xavi happy to have a proven performer at his disposal. He has said of playing De Jong in defence: ‚ÄúI am not sending a message to anyone. ‚ÄúHe can adapt to the position of centre-back. I like him a lot as a player. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had private conversations that are very important, that I will not reveal here.

‚ÄòThere is no luck‚Äô - Dani Alves appears to salute Real Madrid's comeback win over Man City in cryptic Instagram video post,"Dani Alves may boast strong ties to Barcelona, with the Brazilian currently back at Camp Nou for a second spell, but he appears to have saluted the efforts of arch-rivals Real Madrid following their remarkable Champions League semi-final victory over Manchester City. The Blancos refused to throw in the towel during an epic continental clash with Premier League heavyweights and a never say die attitude allowed them to snatch two crucial Rodrygo goals in stoppage-time, before going on to book a final date with Liverpool when Karim Benzema converted from the penalty spot in extra-time. Former Barca boss Pep Guardiola, who is now calling the shots at City, was left cursing his misfortune in elite European competition once again, but Alves has claimed ‚Äúthere is no luck‚Äù in football while also taking an opportunity to ask ‚Äúwhat would football be without the Brazilians‚Äù after seeing fellow countrymen Rodrygo and Vinicius star on the grandest of stages. The 38-year-old right-back, who remains the most decorated player in world football, did not mention Real by name in a cryptic Instagram post, but plenty have been reading between the lines. He said: ‚ÄúFootball friends. ‚ÄúJust like in life, there is no such thing as luck in football. Either you dominate the game or the game dominates you. ‚ÄúAh, what would football be without the Brazilians.‚Äù Alves returned to Barcelona in November 2021 after seeing the Blaugrana fall a long way behind Clasico rivals Real in the Liga title race. He was registered again in January 2022 and did help a side now managed by his former team-mate Xavi to close that gap at one stage. The Blancos have, however, been crowned La Liga champions, with Barca 15 points off the pace in second, and there remains much work to be done in Catalunya if major honours are to be chased down next term. They will be left watching on from afar when Real go in search of a 14th European Cup triumph against Liverpool on May 28, with it yet to be determined whether Alves will be back for more in 2022-23.

Matip warns Liverpool not to concentrate on Manchester City-Aston Villa Premier League season finale,"After scoring the winning goal for Liverpool against Southampton on Tuesday, Joel Matip has warned that they cannot afford to have their concentration on Manchester City during the Premier League season‚Äôs final day. With Matip‚Äôs goal in the 2-1 win, the Reds moved within a point of league leaders City, and the centre-back wants his teammates to focus on their game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. ""It will be hard enough and if our head is somewhere else, that would make it even more of a tough challenge,"" the retired Cameroon defender told the club‚Äôs website. ""We can only look at our game. It will be tough enough to play against Wolves, and our full concentration is on Wolves ‚Äì that‚Äôs the only thing we can change and that‚Äôs what we are doing. ""We will just try our best. We just can play our games and that‚Äôs what we are concentrating on. We try to make it as exciting as possible."" As Liverpool will host Wolves, the Citizens will entertain Steven Gerrard‚Äôs Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium. Meanwhile, Matip explained how he scored the goal that helped the FA Cup winners come from behind to claim the victory at St Mary‚Äôs Stadium. ""Just happy. I don‚Äôt know how it ended up as a goal, to be honest, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. We played well and deserved to win. Everybody was working quite hard,"" said Matip after the game. ""I think I touched it, but in the end, how it ended up there in the net I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt care, to be honest."" After the hard-fought win, Matip ended on the winning side in all eight Premier League matches when he's found the net, while he's only lost in 10 of his 125 Premier League appearances (8%), the lowest ratio of any of the 1,081 players to appear at least 100 times in the competition's history.

Are Juventus throwing away over ‚Ç¨90m by giving injury-prone Dybala a new contract?,"Juventus fans are well used to seeing Paulo Dybala cover his face.  The Juventus No.10 famously celebrates his goals by 'putting on' a mask in tribute to his favourite movie, 'Gladiator'. However, against Sampdoria on September 26, Dybala was trying solely to hide his tears. Just over 20 minutes had been played in the game at the Allianz Stadium when the Argentine felt an all-too-familiar pain.  His pre-season preparations had been interrupted by a thigh problem which sidelined him for nearly three weeks. So, when Dybala felt a twinge in the same area against Sampdoria, he was understandably distraught. Sadly, things have not gone much better for him in the interim. The forward suffered a calf injury while on international duty in November and then, just last weekend, was forced off 12 minutes into Juve's clash with Venezia.  The timing could not have been worse. The primary problem is that Juve are presently struggling to keep up with the top four sides in Serie A, with the Bianconeri slipping to seventh in the standings after their dismal draw in Venice, so they need all the help they can get right now, particularly in attack. However, there was also the fact that Dybala was, as GOAL revealed, just about to put pen to paper on a five-year contract extension worth ‚Ç¨10 million net per annum (‚Ç¨8.5m plus ‚Ç¨1.5m in bonuses). Unsurprisingly, the wisdom of such a deal is now under intense scrutiny, given the overall package would amount to approximately ‚Ç¨92.5m (¬£79m/$104m) including tax.  Dybala is, of course, beloved by Bianconeri fans, who even launched a social media campaign in a desperate bid to persuade their club to keep him when it appeared that the attacker was set to move to the Manchester United in 2019.  Their fondness is understandable too. On his day, Dybala is a devastating attacking talent, a fantastic dribbler blessed with a lethal left foot.  When he scored two goals in Juve's thrilling 3-0 win over Lionel Messi's Barcelona in 2017, it very much looked like a world star had been born.  Of course, the immediate talk of a baton being passed that night in Turin was desperately premature, but there was no denying Dybala's potential. However, while he stepped up another level over the course of the following year, netting a career-high 26 goals in all competitions in 2017-18, his progress has since stalled, and for two reasons. Firstly, Dybala became a tactical dilemma. There was confusion over where best to deploy him.  As former Italy international Antonio Cassano once said on Bobo TV, ""None of his Juve coaches have ever considered him essential, so I wonder if he is really a champion. He doesn't make the difference."" He has often looked utterly unsuited to a modern 4-3-3, and yet even when utilised as a classic No.10, he has admitted himself that he struggles ""to get the ball in between the lines against defensive teams"". There's also the fact that he has proven incompatible with two all-time legends. Dybala always said he was ""lucky"" to be able to play alongside both Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, for Juve and Argentina, respectively, but it has arguably proven his great misfortune. He always appeared too similar to Messi, of course, given the pair both like to take up attacking positions on the right-hand side so that they can cut in on to their favoured left feet, but it was a surprise that he never quite gelled with the very different Ronaldo, especially as they clicked off the field. Regardless, the net result was that Dybala was no longer a guaranteed starter at Juve by the end of Massimo Allegri's first spell as coach, in 2018-19. However, there is no denying that the Old Lady needs him now. Indeed, it is worth remembering that after Ronaldo's shock departure just before the close of the transfer window, captain Giorgio Chiellini told DAZN: ""We move forward. This will be Paulo Dybala's team now.  ""His numbers dipped a little because of the presence of Ronaldo, but he is the key player for this team and all of us recognise that."" Dybala has done his best to assume the mantle of a true team leader. Even though his game time has been limited by his fitness issues, he remains Juve's top scorer (eight) and no other player in the squad has racked up more assists (four, level with Federico Bernardeschi). With Juve struggling to both create and finish chances, which many would attribute to Allegri's conservative tactics, Dybala's importance is obvious, and also explains why he started against Venezia despite being taken off at half-time against Malmo ‚Äì just three days previously. ""We took a risk,"" Allegri admitted to DAZN, ""And it went badly."" And this leads us back to the second issue with Dybala: his physical condition. Dybala was desperately unfortunate to suffer ligament damage in January of this year, but it is worth remembering that he missed the start of the 2020-21 campaign with muscular problems which have repeatedly resurfaced. Juve's willingness to tie down a player that will be out of contract next summer is, of course, understandable.  Losing a player of Dybala's undoubted quality for nothing would be desperately tough to take and, as it stands, he is free to talk to other clubs in just over a fortnight. Time, then, is of the essence, which is why the protracted negotiations over his renewal are expected to be wrapped up before Christmas. However, many fans, ex-players and pundits are wondering if cash-strapped Juve should be committing just under ‚Ç¨100m (¬£87m/$118m) in gross wages to keeping a 28-year-old with a worsening injury record, even if the reported appearance-related clauses mentioned in the press this week have been inserted into the new agreement. The Bianconeri could, of course, be merely looking to ensure they secure a lofty transfer fee for Dybala should they decide to sell him next summer. But again, the question needs to be asked: right now, who would pay top dollar for an injury-plagued player in a footballing economy still devastated by the effects of Covid-19? Unless a significant amount of Dybala's new salary would be directly linked to appearances, the Bianconeri risk making yet another very costly mistake. Dybala being Dybala, he will be determined to return as quickly as possible to prove his worth to a club, or at least a fanbase, that he clearly loves. The reason for the Gladiator mask, after all, is that he says the film got him through tough times, teaching him that ""you always have to fight"". The very real fear, though, is that no matter how he tries, his ongoing fitness battle will only end in further tears.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-throwing-away-90m-dybala-new-contract/blt62d5ec792b836302,Mark Doyle,c18b61e1-e520-4471-9028-e3c8a7287e72
Billionaire Candy still interested in buying Chelsea as government minister says bidders can apply for new licence,"Uncertainty reigns at Chelsea following the news that club owner Roman Abramovich has seen his assets frozen by the UK government, with the Russian businessman in the process of trying to sell the club, but there is hope that a takeover could be completed as billionaire Nick Candy remains an interested party. As things stand, with those boasting ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin facing sanctions outside of their homeland, Abramovich, who has been at the Stamford Bridge helm since 2003, is being prevented from making any kind of profit from his interests in Britain. That has put talk of a sale on hold at Chelsea, while ticket and merchandise sales are shut down, but interested parties are continuing to explore all of their options when it comes to the Premier League heavyweights, with property developer Candy ‚Äì who is a Blues fan ‚Äì confirming that he remains in the race for control of west London giants alongside a number of American investors. A spokesperson for Candy, who is planning to attend Chelsea‚Äôs home date with Newcastle on Sunday, said: ‚ÄúWe are examining the details of yesterday's announcement and we are still interested in making a bid. ‚ÄúClearly this is a time of great uncertainty for all Chelsea fans. In our view, no one is the owner of a football club ‚Äì you are the custodian of it for the fans and the community.‚Äù Candy, who has vowed to put supporters at the centre of the club should he wrestle control from Abramovich, is in talks with several parties over a joint venture. Chelsea can be sold, as long as Roman Abramovich or the Russian Federation doesn't benefit from the sale.Chelsea are in dialogue with the UK government discussing what to do next. pic.twitter.com/3upNw3pQeS While Abramovich is not allowed to benefit from any deals involving Chelsea, Digital and Technology Minister Chris Philp has revealed that potential buyers ‚Äì with an offer from Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss on the table and interest from Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts and New York Jets supremo Woody Johnson being shown ‚Äì could ask for government assistance in discussions regarding licensing agreements. Philp told Sky News: ‚ÄúAs the license conditions are written today, the sale would not be allowed. ‚ÄúIf a buyer emerged then it would be open to that buyer or to the football club to approach the government and ask for the licence conditions to be varied in a way that allowed that sale to take place, and they would be able to approach the government to make a proposal. ‚ÄúTo be clear no proposal would be accepted which saw the money and the proceeds from any sale ending in an unrestricted bank account owned by Abramovich. He can‚Äôt benefit from the proceeds of any sale.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/billionaire-candy-still-interested-buying-chelsea-government/blt47880e8c11f85444,Chris Burton,dd5ef95b-c8d5-4320-94bf-ff1d77747ba7
The rise of Rodri: From Champions League final rejection to becoming Man City's midfield brains,"Pep Guardiola's decision not to play a defensive midfielder in last season's Champions League final is regarded as being one of, if not the main reason why Manchester City lost out to Chelsea. Six months on, and it is crazy to think that Rodri was not even in the equation to start that game. The Spain international had already been left out of the semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, with the veteran Fernandinho preferred by Guardiola. Rodri had played in all of the knockout games to that point, and his frustration was clear in the warm-up rondos at the Etihad Stadium, where for some of the time he could be seen with his hands tucked into his tracksuit trousers. If that was a minor suprise, then the decision to also leave Fernandinho out for the final in Porto and select Ilkay Gundogan at the base of a midfield three was a major shock for fans and media alike, and led to Guardiola facing tough questions about his team selection and tactics. Fast-forward to the present day, and City are back on top of the the Premier League, with Rodri having roared back to become one of Guardiola's most important players. No more so was that illustrated than during the recent thrashings of Leeds United and Newcastle, when the ex-Atletico Madrid man was substituted relatively early on to maintain his freshness for the upcoming busy festive period. It has been a rapid turn around in fortunes for the 25-year-old. Guardiola, a former holding midfielder in his playing days, demands a lot from those who play the position in his teams. He looks for players who can combine positional discipline with high-energy pressing, while also showcasing a sharp use of possession so as to anchor attacks. Fernandinho had the experience and maturity to quickly master the role following Guardiola's arrival in 2016, following in the footsteps of Sergio Busquets at Barcelona, and Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm and Xabi Alonso. The role is demanding, even for someone like Rodri who, in November, completed a degree in Management and Business Administration. He has, however, shown he can fulfil the requirements, and is now performing on a consistent basis so as to be a keystone of Guardiola's side. ""Last season he played good. Maybe in the last part of the season he dropped a little bit, but we gave him more minutes last season and we have to be careful this season,"" Guardiola said of Rodri earlier this term. ""He is playing at an extraordinary level. The consistency - not one game - he has to be here, seven or eight [out of 10], all the time. ""He cannot be three or four because it destroys the team, and cannot be a 10 because 10 is for strikers. He is playing with this consistency, defensively and offensively.‚Äù This is a different Rodri from his two prevous seasons at City, buoyed by a growing confidence and belief in his own ability. He has become a midfielder that is prepared to direct his team-mates around, to break into attacking positions as he did against Leeds, or to smash in 25-yard strikes like his blasted goal against Everton. An absolute rocket üöÄRodri's unbelievable strike against Everton is @budfootball's Goal of the Month for November!#PLAwards | @ManCity pic.twitter.com/bg8dBQvh2r Defensively, he is a player that knows where to position himself on the pitch to cut out counterattacks, resorting to the occasional tactical foul when required, just as his predecessor Fernandinho mastered the art of before him. It was understandable that not too long ago fans questioned whether Rodri would be able to succeed Fernandinho, but also not surprising that Guardiola has been able to mould him into his ideal defensive midfielder. Players such as Riyad Mahrez and Joao Cancelo have taken their time to learn and settle into the Catalan's philosophy, while Jack Grealish is still going through his own adjustment process following his record-breaking summer arrival. But there is even more responsibility and pressure to acclimatise to in Rodri's role, so that he has done so is a credit to the way he has taken feedback on board and improved. His influence can be difficult to prove with statistics in comparison to other areas of the pitch. One revealing figure, however, is that only Liverpool's Thiago Alcantara has a better percentage of successful presses from midfield this season, though the ex-Bayern Munich man has played only half the number of minutes as his Spain team-mate. Perhaps the biggest indicator of Rodri's impact is that City have won 18 of the 21 games he has started this season, and just one of the six he has not. Of those three they did not win when he was in the line-up, one was the defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain and another the draw at Liverpool - two games that City dominated for long periods. The only major blip, then, came in the 2-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace in October. That 2-2 draw at Anfield was possibly Rodri's most impressive performance of the campaign, coming against a Liverpool side that threaten to overrun visiting sides at home. Rodri held his own before coming up with a sensational block to deny Fabinho a late winner, eating up the ground as the Brazil international looked certain to tap into an empty net. ""For me the ball was in,"" Jurgen Klopp admitted at full-time, highlighting the miraculous nature of Rodri's intervention. The City star brushed off the incident as just helping the team, but there is no doubt that his presence has been crucial in helping City regain top spot in the Premier League ahead of their clash with Leicester City on Boxing Day. ""It‚Äôs not an easy position,"" Rodri admitted earlier in the season. ""You need to find the role, the team needs you and I understand perfectly what the team demands from me. ""I try to do my best every game and try to learn every day."" It's a position where players can never stop learning under Guardiola, but Rodri is starting to become a master of his craft. Far from being left out of key games in the future, he is becoming one of the first names on the Man City teamsheet.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rise-rodri-champions-league-final-rejection-man-city-brains/bltb710a9538cf7fc4a,Jonathan Smith,b10e2099-7846-473d-bc83-3ebe610dd3dc
Trending: Cameroon won match but Comoros won our hearts - Fans react after hosts advance in Afcon 2021,"Cameroon survived a late scare by 10-man Comoros to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals where they will face the Gambia. It was not an easy afternoon for the debutants who had to start the match with left-back Chaker Alhadhur in goal owing to the unavailability of their three recognised custodians. Ali Ahamada and Moyadh Ousseni returned positive Covid-19 results on Sunday and had been ruled out of the game. It was bad news for the Coelacanths who had also lost Salim Ben Boina to a shoulder injury. The Comoros faithful's hopes of seeing their team defy the odds and eliminate the tournament hosts were thwarted in the sixth minute when their team were reduced to 10 men after the sending off of Nadjim Abdou for a reckless challenge. The hosts went on to win the game courtesy of stikes from Vincent Aboubakar and Karl Toko Ekambi, with Youssouf M'Changama.  But Comoros had done enough to leave an impression.  Here is how fans reacted after the game: ""Cameroon won the match but Comoros won our hearts"" Our intention was to win the match not your bitter hrts! üòÖüòÖüòÖRest #AFCON2021#TeamCameroon üá®üá≤üá®üá≤ Chaker Alhadhur.

"Christian Pulisic salary, net worth, girlfriend, sister, jersey number and everything you need to know about AC Milan's USMNT star","Christian Pulisic is the face of American soccer and perhaps the most recognizable player in the history of the U.S. men's national team. Just 23-years-old, Pulisic has reached unprecedented heights for his nation, winning the Champions League with Chelsea while helping to lead the U.S. back to the World Cup after missing out in 2018. Having been in the spotlight since he was 16 years old, Pulisic's rise has been remarkable as he continues to transcend American soccer. Here's everything you need to know about the 22-year-old star: As a child, Pulisic played for local U.S. Soccer Development Academy club PA Classics and, at age 11, trained at Cobham with Chelsea's youth setup. He signed with Borussia Dortmund in 2015, with his family's Croatian heritage allowing him to head to Germany at just 16. He played for Dortmund until 2019 before earning a $73 million (¬£57.6 million) transfer to Chelsea. The American international had a shambolic return to his youth club as he was consistently dropped to the bench by the string of managers in charge of the Blues. Pulisic made a switch to Italian heavyweights AC Milan in the summer window of 2023 in hopes of reviving his club career for a transfer fee of ‚Ç¨22m.  Entering the 2022-23 Premier League season, Pulisic has scored a total of 44 goals in 243 club games. A total of 19 of those goals came during his time at Borussia Dortmund, with his final season being his most prolific there as he scored seven goals in 30 appearances. His best season at Chelsea, meanwhile, was his first, as he scored 11 times in 34 games in all competitions. In total, Pulisic has produced 25 goals in 116 games since joining the Blues. At international level, Pulisic has scored 21 goals in 51 appearances for the USMNT. The incredible rise of Captain America üá∫üá∏Christian Pulisic has come a long way since his inclusion on the 2017 #NXGN list üìà pic.twitter.com/Bt6tUyx1f4 Since bursting onto the scene, Pulisic has been hailed as Captain America, alluding to the famous Marvel superhero of the same name. The nickname had previously been used by Claudio Reyna, whose son Gio, coincidentally, calls Pulisic a teammate with the national team. Pulisic also has a more tongue-in-cheek nickname, the LeBron James of Soccer, which stems from an episode of Pawn Stars where the Chelsea winger is compared to the basketball icon. The winger wears the same shirt number for both club and country, with Pulisic earning the No. 10 jersey with both Chelsea and the USMNT. The former Borussia Dortmund is touted to wear the No. 11 jersey during his stint at AC Milan. Pulisic reportedly earned around ¬£145,000 ($177,000) a week¬†at Chelsea after signing from Borussia Dortmund. Therefore, he earned approximately ¬£7.5m¬†($9.1m)¬†every year¬†from his base club contract alone, so his¬†five-year deal with the Blues was tipped to be worth ¬£37.5m ($49m)¬†in total. ¬† At Milan, Pulisic is about to garner a lesser salary of $85,000 per week after the USMNT star decided to take a pay cut to join the Rossoneri. Although it is difficult to put an exact number on it, Pulisic's net worth is¬†estimated to be around $40 million, per Ventured. That number would include Pulisic's on-field earnings, as well as off-field sponsorships with the likes of Puma, Gatorade, Chipotle and EA Sports. Pulisic's parents, Kelley and Mark, both played college soccer at George Mason University, while his father went on to play professional indoor soccer for the Harrisburg Heat. His paternal grandfather, Mate Pulisic, was born in Croatia, with the winger being given the middle name Mate in honor of his grandfather. Pulisic also has one sister, Devyn. The winger isn't the only professional soccer player in the family, though, as his cousin Will is a goalkeeper that plays for USL League One club North Carolina FC on loan from Austin FC. To date, Pulisic has never revealed his relationship status. Pulisic is listed at 5-foot-10.

Emmanuel Dennis can score 15 to 20 goals for West Ham United next season - Philips,"Ex-Sunderland striker Kevin Philips has encouraged West Ham United to sign Nigeria and Watford attacker Emmanuel Dennis to help reduce the pressure on Michail Antonio at the club. The Super Eagles attacker scored 10 goals and provided six assists for the Hornets in 33 Premier League matches this season, but his contributions could not help the club from being relegated. However, he is still contracted to the club until 2026, but Philips believes he can score 15 to 20 goals for the Hammers if they bring him on board. Antonio has featured for the Londoners 35 times in the English top-tier, scoring nine goals and assisting eight times in the process. ""West Ham are in desperate need of a striker this summer,"" the now 48-year-old former England striker told Football Insider. ""They can‚Äôt rely on Michail Antonio all season again. A striker is a real priority, certainly. He [Dennis] could be one of these shrewd signings who can end up getting you 15-20 goals a season. ""He‚Äôs going to be playing in a more creative, better side if he goes to West Ham. All of a sudden, he goes from a ¬£20million player to a ¬£40million player. ""I think it‚Äôs a gamble worth taking. He‚Äôs shown he can score a variety of goals at this level."" Watford will be ending their campaign in the top tier on Sunday afternoon without the services of the injured Dennis. The 24-year-old West African started his football career at Kwara Football Academy Ilorin and was there from 2010 to 2016. He then joined Zorya Luhansk for a year and later on moved to Club Brugge. He has also played for Bundesliga outfit FC Koln before joining the English side at the beginning of the season. Dennis has also represented the Nigeria U23 team before being promoted to the Super Eagles in 2019. He has so far played five matches for them.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/emmanuel-dennis-can-score-15-to-20-goals-for-west-ham-united/bltc125f1b876765d09,Seth Willis,e3c0e8b4-c066-42ce-bc1c-817e22a24f68
Lucas Silva: From Real Madrid's next star midfielder to the Brazilian second division with Gremio,"In March this year, Gremio midfielder Lucas Silva shared a shocking image on social media of the facial stitches he needed after being hit by a mobile phone, thrown by a fan of rival Brazilian team Internacional. ""Another sad chapter of our football. Of so many we've had and that seems to have increased in recent days,"" Silva wrote on Twitter after the incident, which saw him hit in the mouth while celebrating the third goal in a 3-0 win with his team mates. It was the latest bump on the rocky career road of Silva, a man once tipped as the next big thing in the Real Madrid midfield, but instead finds himself playing in the Brazilian second tier. He joined Gremio in January 2020, four months after leaving Madrid and five years after he had first left South America in a ‚Ç¨14 million move from Cruzeiro, at which point he was described as ‚Äúthe future‚Äù by manager Carlo Ancelotti. ""I take great pride and great satisfaction in accepting the challenge of wearing this great shirt of Brazilian and world football,"" Silva posted on Twitter. ""Thank you for your confidence and be sure there will be no lack of commitment, dedication and hard work."" Hard work does not always get just rewards, and so has been the case for Silva at Gremio. The team, Libertadores champions and Club World Cup finalists as recently as 2017, were relegated in 2021 amid turbulence and turnover in the playing and coaching ranks. Silva is anchoring the midfield in an attempt to steer Gremio out of a stacked Serie B which contains fellow traditional heavyweights Cruzeiro and Vasco da Gama. Now 29, he is among the senior heads in the dressing room. Now longer is he the wide-eyed wonderkid Real Madrid fans may remember - or maybe not, given he made only eight Liga appearances across four years as a Blanco. It all started so well. Voted the best midfielder in Brazil‚Äôs Serie A for 2014, he made the long journey across the Atlantic to Santiago Bernabeu, a dream come true. ‚ÄúI am really happy and motivated. I've come to Real Madrid to learn and above all else to help,‚Äù Silva said at his unveiling.¬† ‚ÄúI feel good and am ready to honour this shirt, which belongs to the best club in the world. I've liked Real Madrid ever since I was a child. I'm really happy to be in the city and I'm certain that I will live very well here.‚Äù He made his Liga debut in February 2015, and his Champions League bow a few days after with 90 minutes of a 2-0 last 16 victory over Schalke. Still a young man fresh to the European game, Silva was loaned to Marseille for the 2014-15 season to get more first team minutes - and the problems began. He couldn‚Äôt hold down a place in Marseille‚Äôs starting XI, and when he declined a new loan out to Anderlecht in January, he was frozen out by the Ligue 1 side. Returning to Madrid ahead of 2015-16, a loan to Sporting CP was set up - but collapsed when his medical in Lisbon detected an irregular heartbeat. Not only Silva‚Äôs move, but his entire career was put on hold. Clarification that the unusual heartbeat was not a long-term problem allowed him to resume playing, but it added to the list of reasons why Madrid were not convinced to give him first team chances. Torcedor/Jogador D√°-lhe, @Gremio!!! üáßüáºüòÅü•Å pic.twitter.com/67LT0zXMbd In January 2017 he returned to Cruzeiro on loan, and remained there for two and a half years before his Madrid contract was terminated by mutual consent. He was then left as a free agent as the Brazilian giants were amid a financial implosion and a few months after Silva left - in a foreshadowing to his Gremio days - suffered their own humiliating demotion, being relegated to Serie B for the first time in their history. So Silva, without doing anything massively wrong during his time in Europe, found himself swept back home having made barely a mark and with only a few rueful memories of what might have been. ‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd had more opportunities in Madrid, but it just wasn‚Äôt possible. It was still a great experience. I learned a lot and with only one year left on my contract, we both decided it was better for everyone to just terminate the deal early,‚Äù Silva told Tuttomercatoweb in September 2019. ‚ÄúI was considered the best young midfielder in Brazil when I arrived, so naturally I expected it to go differently with Madrid, but I regret nothing and want to think only of the next opportunity.‚Äù Instead, Silva has thrown himself into life at Gremio - pictures on his social media show him banging a drum in the blue and white club colours, taking selfies with fans and celebrating with the trophy of the recently won local competition, Campeonato Gaucho.  Recently, he made his 100th appearance for the club. It may not be the career he should have had, but if he can help Gremio back into the Brazilian top flight and continue to rack up the appearances for The Immortal Tricolour, then Silva can become a cherished player at one of South America's most famous clubs.  When you take everything into account, that's not a bad career at all.

"Nottingham Forest vs Tottenham: Predictions, tips & betting odds","Nottingham Forest welcome Tottenham to the City Ground on Sunday afternoon in the Premier League, as Antonio Conte's men aim to continue their unbeaten start to the season. The side from north London have claimed seven points from their opening three matches and are well-fancied to record another success against their newly promoted opponents. The visitors can be backed at 4/9 (1.44) with bet365 to pick up three points from their trip to the east Midlands and last season Spurs won nine matches on the road. The hosts for their part are offered at 6/1 (7.00) and won their last home match 1-0 against West Ham. The draw can be backed at 18/5 (5.40). Harry Kane is the favourite to break the deadlock on Sunday with the England captain offered at 3/1 (4.00) to score the first goal of the game as he did last time out against Wolves. Fellow forward Heung-min Son is priced at 9/2 (5.50), with new signing Richarlison at 11/2 (6.50) although neither player has found the back of the net so far this term. Forest's Taiwo Awoniyi was the scorer of the only goal of the game against West Ham and is offered at 11/1 (12.00) to open the scoring once again. Spurs will be looking to build on their first clean sheet of the season last weekend and a solid defence will surely be the foundation upon which Antonio Conte constructs his side. Last season on the road Tottenham kept clean sheets against Wolves, Everton, Watford, Brentford, Leeds, Brighton, Norwich and Aston Villa, all clubs in the mid to lower part of the table and there could be some interest in backing them to record another shutout against a team likely to be battling relegation this season. Forest's attack has not been firing on all cylinders and investing in a clean sheet for the visitors could prove profitable. Spurs are available at 6/5 (2.20) to keep a clean sheet and that looks like a healthy price. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

Guardiola claims former Leeds boss Bielsa would have won more than him at Barcelona,"Pep Guardiola believes Marcelo Bielsa would have won more trophies than him had he been in charge of the Barcelona dynasty he guided a decade ago, while adding that he would have struggled to transform Leeds United's fortunes the way the Argentine did. Bielsa left the Whites earlier this season with the team in the thick of a relegation battle, but his exit has not dulled the respect that the club, the city and the manager's peers have for his talents. Guardiola has made no secret of his admiration for his fellow tactician, and has now revealed that he thinks if their positions had been reversed, it would only highlight the gulf in quality between the two, despite the Spaniard holding far more honours across his shorter career. Speaking toTelemundo Sports, Guardiola burnished his already famous admiration of the Argentine with the claim that the latter would have conquered more titles than he if gifted control of the Blaugrana - and that he would not have been able to transform his Whites side. ""Give him my Barcelona and you will see how he will win titles,"" he said. ""Give me Leeds, with all due respect to the Leeds players, but I would still be in the Championship."" Much was made of the bond shared between Bielsa and coaches who have been inspired by his methods during the latter's stay with Leeds, but the relationship between him and Guardiola stretches back beyond their Premier League days. The Argentine famously helped persuade the Spaniard to take up coaching near the end of his playing days, and the pair then faced off in the 2012 Copa del Rey final, when Guardiola's Blaugrana beat the former's Athletic Club to the title. Guardiola led the tributes to Bielsa following his dismissal by Leeds in February, describing his stay at Elland Road as ""spectacular"" after he guided a previously struggling Whites team back to the Premier League following their demotion 18 years earlier.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-claims-former-leeds-boss-bielsa-would-have-won/bltb5a2724662795c1c,Andrew Steel,06f06ff3-2297-49f5-866c-a705374be3cb

"Benitez gone, but Everton remain a mess on and off the field","In the end, the biggest surprise was that it took this long. Rafa Benitez and Everton always looked like a marriage made in hell, and so it turned out. The divorce was confirmed on Sunday, and few tears will be shed at Goodison Park. The end of an error, you could call it, but that would perhaps be too kind an assessment. Saturday‚Äôs defeat at Norwich City, a side that had lost its previous six Premier League matches without scoring, proved to be the final straw. Everton may have started the season well enough - they were fourth in the table at the start of October - but they have sunk like a stone since, and this represented rock bottom. Benitez leaves them in 16th, just six points above the bottom three and having taken just six points from the last 39 on offer. They have not kept a clean sheet since November 7, and have not won away from home in the league since the end of August. The fans who made the long trek to Carrow Road made their feelings crystal clear. ""GET OUT OF OUR CLUB"" read the huge blue banner in the away end, while the boos and jeers which greeted the final whistle told their own story. These are supporters that are falling out of love with their club, and little wonder. In May, it will be 27 years since Everton last won a trophy, 17 since they last finished in the top four and 13 since they last contested a major final. They are one of English football‚Äôs great football clubs, but what have they had to cheer during the Premier League era? Not much, and certainly not enough. Benitez, it should be said, is not responsible for all their ills. There is a reason why fans sang ‚ÄòSack the Board‚Äô at Norwich. They know the club‚Äôs troubles run far beyond the man in the dugout. But even so, his presence was still a huge problem. His connection to Liverpool meant he started on the back foot, and the passive, defensive style he imposes on his teams meant he would certainly not win the doubters over with entertainment. He would point to mitigating factors. Losing Dominic Calvert-Lewin for nearly four months left a hole up front, and the absence of players such as Richarlison, Yerry Mina and Abdoulaye Doucoure left holes that simply could not be plugged. Because make no mistake; Everton‚Äôs squad is poor and in need of a major overhaul, whoever is in charge. Benitez knew that when he signed up to a three-year deal in the summer, and it was almost inevitable that he would soon be clashing with Marcel Brands, the director of football. Everton made four signings before the season, spending less than ¬£2 million ($2.7m) in total, and all of them were Benitez picks. Demarai Gray and Andros Townsend, in fairness, have done well, though the less said about Salomon Rondon the better. Brands left in December after a hammering at the hands of Liverpool, and Benitez also oversaw the departures of both Dan Donachie, the club‚Äôs long-serving director of medical services, and Gretar Steinsson, the head of recruitment. His last act, prior to the Norwich debacle at least, was to sanction the sale of Lucas Digne to Aston Villa, a move which divided the fanbase. Digne had been frozen out after a training-ground row, with Benitez publicly suggesting the France international was more concerned with personal stats than with the team‚Äôs success. Everton have signed two up-and-coming full-backs this month, Vitalii Mykolenko and Nathan Patterson, and last week loaned Anwar El Ghazi from Villa, but it will take more than that to turn this ship around. They lack depth and quality in pretty much every area. How on earth has Farhad Moshiri, the club‚Äôs majority owner, managed to get things so wrong? Everton, it bears repeating, have employed six different ‚Äòpermanent managers‚Äô in Moshiri‚Äôs six years at the club and, under the ‚Äòguidance‚Äô of two different directors of football, committed more than ¬£550m in transfer fees. They have tried everything, from the ‚ÄòHollywood‚Äô manager - Moshiri‚Äôs description of Ronald Koeman - to Sam Allardyce the firefighter and Marco Silva the bright young thing. Even Carlo Ancelotti, the serial winner, could not get them purring. What chance did 'Rafa the Red' have? The mistakes and missteps have been staggering. Yannick Bolasie, Theo Walcott, Morgan Schneiderlin, Davy Klaassen, Alex Iwobi, Moise Kean, Jean-Phillippe Gbamin, Andre Gomes, Yerry Mina and Cenk Tosun all cost in excess of ¬£20m. None of them have delivered. Everton threw money at Wayne Rooney and James Rodriguez, superstars on the way down, and allowed others - Klaassen, Nikola Vlasic, Ademola Lookman - to depart without getting the chance to leave a footprint. Neither Steve Walsh, the supposed architect of Leicester City‚Äôs Premier League miracle, nor Brands, the debonair Dutchman brought in from PSV Eindhoven, have been able to find the recipe. While their peers and rivals make smart, long-term moves and have well-defined structures, Everton have bounced from one masterplan to another. The Benitez experiment should represent a line in the sand, as far as Moshiri is concerned. That appointment was his and his alone, and it did not take a genius to work out that it would end badly. Where they go from here, who knows? Duncan Ferguson will take interim charge again, and may well be the best candidate for the job permanently, given his association with the club. The alternatives are not exactly jumping out. Roberto Martinez is the bookmakers' favourite to return six years on from his own sacking at Goodison Park, while Kasper Hjulmand and Frank Lampard have been touted, but they do not look a good fit from here. Would someone like Graeme Potter, for example, want to play Russian Roulette with his career and leave behind a good thing at Brighton? Whoever it is, one thing is clear. Everton and their supporters deserve better. Whether they will get it, though, is another matter.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/benitez-gone-everton-mess-on-off-field/blt36db05a46e6db1c9,Neil Jones,3bf2ec58-c381-470e-9ba2-ab01c4026fdf

'Not a quick learner' - Grealish bashed by Souness over Man City debut season,"Jack Grealish is yet to showcase any noticeable improvement at Manchester City, claims Graeme Souness, with the England international's struggle to adapt marking him out as less than a ""top player"". The winger made a record-breaking ¬£100m ($120m) switch to Pep Guardiola's side last term, and became a Premier League champion in his first campaign at the Etihad Stadium. But his involvement was more restricted than some anticipated given the price tag, and now Souness has opined that he has not lived up to his billing to date. ""He‚Äôs not a quick learner,"" Souness stated on the former Villa man during a Sky Bet debate with fellow pundits. ""All the top players are quick learners. Jack‚Äôs had a year and for me he‚Äôs not improved. I have not mentioned his transfer fee [too]. ""City have got some world-class players. I‚Äôm looking at what he gives in the 90 minutes. I don‚Äôt see any improvement at all in him. Top players are quick learners."" Former Manchester United stalwart Roy Keane defended Grealish however, countering: ""We‚Äôll try and give Jack the benefit of the doubt. He‚Äôs gone in and he‚Äôs not really had the run of games, he had one or two injuries earlier in the season. The penny has to drop."" Across his first season with the Citizens, Grealish notched 26 appearances in the Premier League, with 22 of those in Guardiola's starting XI. But he was an unused player for the other dozen top-flight games, with his manager's rotational approach reducing his overall role. He only managed three goals in the league - just half the number he netted in as many games for Villa the term before.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/100m-man-grealish-yet-to-improve-at-man-city-claims-souness/blt86967e2bca910968,Andrew Steel,94ad6588-ba81-440b-b5ab-7b9d035cdfce
"16 years, 25 trophies... but now it's goodbye: How to watch Marcelo's Real Madrid farewell ceremony online","Real Madrid are giving Marcelo a farewell ceremony in the Spanish capital on Monday as a final gesture of appreciation for his service to the club. Marcelo  as the team's all-time most decorated player with 25 trophies to his name, including five Champions League titles. The left-back spent 16 seasons with Real Madrid's senior team. The event is scheduled to begin at 1 pm local time (noon UK, 7 am EST). Madrid will showcase every trophy he won with the club amid the celebrations, and he will hold a press conference afterwards.

Fans can watch the ceremony and press conference online on Real Madrid TV, the club's official streaming service. Highlights of the action are also expected to be shared on social media. While Ramos left Santiago Bernabeu after contentious contract negotiations fell apart, Marcelo's break from the club has been clean and he has showed no signs of bitterness. ‚ÄúI feel great joy and emotion,"" Marcelo said after last month's Champions League final triumph.

‚ÄòKorean women‚Äôs football is moving backwards‚Äô - Cho determined to take Asian Cup ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô with South Korea,"Cho So-hyun, captain of South Korean's women's national team, says she feels ‚Äúashamed of improvements‚Äù in women‚Äôs football at home, believing things are ‚Äúmoving backwards‚Äù. The midfielder will lead her team out at the Asian Cup this month, looking to deliver success after the country failed to reach the knockout rounds four years ago. Cho, who plays her club football in England with Tottenham, sees the tournament as ‚Äúthe best opportunity‚Äù to show how good her team can be, despite her feelings about the game in Korea. Speaking to GOAL in an exclusive interview, Cho said: ‚ÄúI feel ashamed of improvements of K-football because I feel like it's moving backwards since every Korean young pro player is moving abroad. ‚ÄúYoung players who are playing elite and pro, the number is not really high. In the long term, I don't think it shows high improvement. ‚ÄúThe women's football teams in Europe are highly improving, but compared to Asian leagues, the programme of training is absolutely different. ‚ÄúFor the self-improvement [for Korean players], I recommend to go to European leagues. I'm not saying that Asian players are not good at playing soccer, but I want to say to improve the skills and improve the physical [abilities], to improve both ways, I think it's much better to go and play and experience a team abroad.‚Äù Cho is one of three Korean stars who play for a club in England, alongside Chelsea midfielder Ji So-yun and Brighton forward Lee Geum-min. Asked if she believes there is anything players like herself and her high-profile team-mates can do to help the situation at home, she said spoke about the structure around elite teams and the dense football pyramid that England has in comparison to Korea. ‚ÄúIn England, the local soccer teams, they're always being competitive and that always helped them to improve more,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIf we have local soccer teams, it means that we can also improve the local financial stuff and so on. ‚ÄúThe boys‚Äô soccer teams in Korea, they have various types, from the amateur and the elite. They are trying their best to figure out which player do they have, but in Korea for the women's soccer team, I don't think they are trying their best.‚Äù Cho was speaking from the SingaCup, an event in Singapore that gives young boys and girls the chance to participate in several footballing activities. She explained one reason she got involved was to shine a light on how things are at home for young footballers. ‚ÄúI wanted to truly inform [people of] how the current situation in Korea is,‚Äù the 33-year-old said. ‚ÄúI was also wondering how the foreigners are looking at the Korean soccer team as well.‚Äù Cho and her team will have the chance to show the potential Korea has this month and how good it could be with more support, with the Asian Cup to kick off on January 20. Korea will face Vietnam a day later in their opening fixture, with Myanmar also in Group C with them, alongside reigning champions Japan. ‚ÄúI think this is the best opportunity that I have,‚Äù Cho said. ‚ÄúIf I can get the girls far, it means I can show the power of an Asian women's football team.

‚ÄòThe fish dies through the mouth‚Äô - Simeone snaps back at Atletico critics ahead of Man City showdown,"Diego Simeone has never been one to mince his words, with the Atletico Madrid coach snapping back at supposed ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù to have dared to question his tactical approach to management. The Argentine tactician has built his reputation on building defensively sound teams, with that system allowing him to deliver La Liga title glory and Champions League final appearances in the Spanish capital. His philosophy is not universally lauded, though, with legendary former AC Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi among those to suggest that Simeone‚Äôs sides are ‚Äúboring‚Äù after seeing them register no shots in the first leg of a European quarter-final clash with Manchester City, while Pep Guardiola and Kevin De Bruyne commented on a supposed 5-5-0 formation.

I‚Äôve been here since 2005-06 and I‚Äôve never talked down to a colleague of mine or talked badly. ‚ÄúI always try to get in the other coaches' shoes and there's different ways of expressing what you think and what you believe in every game. ‚ÄúWhen you don't show appreciation I don't really share it but there is opinions of every journalist, ex-player and people who haven't played the game for a while and they want to say a different thing. ‚ÄúLike my dad said: ‚ÄòThe fish dies through the mouth‚Äô. It's a saying. Talk is free and everybody can talk but I don't talk badly of colleagues and we all have our opinions. And I always respect my fellow coaches. ‚ÄúWe can all have an opinion, but among colleagues we all have ways, I always respect my colleagues, always, always.‚Äù Atletico Madrid have kept more Champions League clean sheets than anyone else since Diego Simeone's first appearance in the competition ‚úã pic.twitter.com/pxUj2bezGQ While Simeone will not be changing his ways, he will need Atletico to offer a greater threat at Wanda Metropolitano than they managed at the Etihad Stadium as they seek to overturn a 1-0 aggregate deficit. The man calling the shots believes a side that possess the attacking talents of Antoine Griezmann and Joao Felix can do just that while sticking to a blueprint that has served them so well, for so long. He added when asked what his game plan will be when locking horns will old adversary Guardiola once again: ‚ÄúOf course we‚Äôre not going to go too far from what we normally do. We will go for the perfect timing to try to create what we can do. ‚ÄúWe can have faster transitions and counter-attacks that we have and be clinical in front of goal.

Chelsea in major board shake-up as transfer chief Granovskaia leaving & Boehly assumes interim sporting director role,"Chelsea's transfer chief Marina Granovskaia will follow a host of other board members out of the club, with Todd Boehly becoming interim sporting director.¬† Granovskaia has been the single most important figure in conducting transfers in west London and the upheaval could cause issues when signing players - but she officially left the club on Wednesday morning, albeit she will still be available in a supporting role this summer. It follows, as first revealed by GOAL, the exits of CEO Guy Laurence and the sanctioned Roman Abramovich advisor Eugene Tenenbaum.¬† Boehly has taken over as interim sporting director and chairman, with further changes to come. He has been overseeing transfer activity in the early part of the market but is relying on the expertise of others within the football operation. Granovskaia has left her official role but will remain at Chelsea this summer to help them oversee their transfer dealings for the 2022-23 season. ""As custodians of Chelsea , we now begin executing our long-term vision and plan for the club, creating an outstanding experience for its passionate, loyal fans, and continuing to challenge for top honours in line with Chelsea's decorated history,"" Boehly told the club website. ""We thank Marina for her many years of excellent service to the Club and wish her all the best in her future ventures."" Former club chairman Bruce Buck will remain as a senior advisor to the club having impressed the Boehly-Clearlake ownership group.¬† The Blues have head of football operations David Barnard and technical and performance advisor Petr Cech able to step in on the transfer front too.¬† The new board has not been announced but the key stakeholders in the new ownership consortium will have places on the panel.¬†This involves the private equity firm Clearlake Capital and billionaires Hansjorg Wyss and Mark Walter.¬† There are expected to be further announcements on non-executive board roles for Conservative Party Member of the House of Lords Danny Finkelstein and PR executive Barbara Charone.¬† The new ownership group have ambitious plans for the west Londoners but many inside the men's football operation were concerned that the late completion of the takeover may hold the Blues back in this transfer window. Chelsea are amidst the most drastic change in their transfer structure for over a decade.  Boehly's role as interim sporting director formalises a position that he has filled ever since the takeover after he took an active role in the negotiations to loan Romelu Lukaku to Inter.  It follows his consultations with Thomas Tuchel, Emma Hayes and Neil Bath - Chelsea's academy manager). The interim nature of his role means he'll get to understand the club before handing it over to a new full-time sporting director.  The current scouts will remain in place and so will Petr Cech, who offers an advisory role to the board for the football operation.  Chelsea are ambitious but are playing catch up in the transfer window. They're keen to put Tuchel's ideas at the heart of the rebuild of the men's first-team operation. Granovskaia won the award for Best Club Director in European football in 2021.¬† The Russian-Canadian dual national informally came to London when Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, advising him throughout his ownership, but only officially became part of the operation in 2010.¬† She grew her association with Abramovich through the business which brought most of his wealth in the oil company Sibneft.¬† It's unclear what Granovskaia will do next having run the football operation at Chelsea in an unusual structure for one of Europe's top clubs.¬† It had been thought that Chelsea weren't planning major changes to their board structure until after the transfer window was over, through briefings made during the takeover process.¬†However, alternative decisions have since been taken.¬† ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-transfer-chief-granovskaia-leave-new-ownership/blt73616fb7d8319d86,Nizaar Kinsella,f4c16f16-c623-4498-a5d8-df9793b955b5
Haaland to Man City talk 'impossible' says Guardiola while Barcelona director says transfer would be 'very difficult',"Erling Haaland's potential summer move has been discussed by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and Barcelona vice-president Rafa Yuste, as rumours continue to grow. The prolific Borussia Dortmund striker is rumoured to be on his way out this summer, with Man City and Barca said to be keen on his signature. However, both Guardiola and Yuste played down the possibility of their respective clubs signing Haaland in the summer. Guardiola said: ""Since I am here, every month or two months people say we are going to sign 50 players. Right now, listen, It‚Äôs impossible that I am going to talk about some guy who is not here. He‚Äôs a Dortmund player and we‚Äôve an incredible run ahead of us.  ""At the end of the season it is the transfer window and many things are going to happen. Maybe I speak about this club needing a striker for next five, six, seven years maybe once in last 12 months. I‚Äôm not going to be the guy saying we are a success or not a success because we didn‚Äôt have a striker.  ""We have to play good and arrive with seven or eight players in the box. This is the best way to score goals. We are right now, heading into a game to try to get to Wembley in the semi finals of the FA Cup, we are in the last eight teams of the Champions League.  ""We'd love to be 20 points ahead of Liverpool but this is impossible but we are there. What we have done so far is great. then we come back and play the games, pray the players come back from international teams with no injuries and we fight to try to do it."" Speaking to Mundo Deportivo, Yuste said: ¬†""We have to focus on our club, there is a long way to go. We have found a club with a terrible economic situation, which has not allowed us to generate in 'fair play' the expectations that we should have had.  ""As the president said, the entity comes first and we cannot do according to what things that put us at risk. I see transfers of this magnitude as very difficult, although it can never be said unfeasible¬†because the world of football goes around a lot. ""During Guardiola's time, he told me that his dream was to play with an eleven from home and it continues to be my dream and we see that the youngsters show that they can have this relay of teams that we have seen in a dream. ""This is our path,¬†we are not going to go crazy¬†, under any circumstances,¬†with any player.""

"Steve Cooper ‚Äòhe hates the Leicester, he hates the Derby‚Äô chant: Lyrics & meaning of Nottingham Forest fan song","The role of Nottingham Forest manager can be a rather thankless one at times, with the shadow of Brian Clough looming large over anybody who dares to step through the doors and set up residence in the City Ground dugout. For many, the weight of expectation on Trentside has proved too much ‚Äì with the Reds rattling through bosses at an alarming rate ‚Äì but Steve Cooper has embraced the past, present and future to allow dreams of a potential Premier League return to form for a success-starved fan base. The affable Welshman has been warmly embraced into the hearts of Forest supporters everywhere, with it coming as no surprise to find that he is often loudly serenaded with his own personal chant. What is that song and how can you get involved? GOAL is on hand to deliver all of the information you need. The song, which has been sung in various guises by the Forest faithful, goes: Stevie Cooper, Stevie CooperHe hates the Leicester, he hates the DerbyForest are magic!Stevie Cooper, Stevie CooperHe hates the Leicester, he hates the DerbyForest are magic! (repeat) Check out a video of Nottingham Forest fans singing the song below The chant is a simple sing-chorus song, where fans sing Steve Cooper's name, followed by a declaration that he ""hates"" Forests rivals Leicester and Derby, concluded with a reminder that his team are ""magic"". Cooper was appointed as Nottingham Forest manager on September 21, 2021 with the club rooted to the foot of the Championship table. He had been out of work since severing ties with Swansea at the end of the 2020-21 campaign ‚Äì a side that he led to the second tier play-offs in successive seasons. It appeared unlikely when taking the reins at the City Ground that a hat-trick would be on the cards there, but a remarkable reversal in fortune has been overseen by a coach that is never anything but positive. He has refused to stray from a ‚Äòone game at a time‚Äô mantra with Forest, with short-term goals delivering potentially long-term benefits. On the back of the club‚Äôs worst start to a season in 108 years, Cooper delivered 26 wins, 10 draws and only eight defeats from his 44 games at the helm in all competitions during his first season.

'Miles off it!' - Grealish roasts Bernardo Silva at Man City trophy parade after Premier League title triumph,"Jack Grealish roasted Manchester City team-mate Bernardo Silva during Monday's Premier League title parade, joking that the Portuguese midfielder's best contribution to the final game of the season against Aston Villa was leaving the pitch. Manchester City needed to win that fixture to claim their domestic silverware, but when Bernardo Silva exited, they trailed 1-0. After going behind by two goals, Pep Guardiola's side battled back to win 3-2 with Ilkay Gundogan, the man who replaced Bernardo Silva, scoring twice. ""Do you know what?"" Grealish said on camera during a live stream of festivities. ""I said earlier on the coach, it's been brilliant to win my first title.  ""I want to thank everyone, but the main person I want to thank is Bernardo Silva for coming off in the [68th] minute, because he was miles off it yesterday!"" Team-mates Kyle Walker and John Stones laughed next to Grealish during his remarks. The attacker's humorous comments came despite not featuring at all against former club Aston Villa in the title decider. It was a rocky debut term for Grealish, as he managed just 10 goal involvements in 39 appearances across all competitions, but he nonetheless emerged as a leading jokester in the dressing room. From not knowing the word ""encyclopedia"" to winding up Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, Grealish made headlines throughout the campaign. He's admitted the adjustment to Manchester City was difficult at times, but he hopes he can increase his on-field production moving forward. ""It‚Äôs been a lot more difficult than I thought it would be in terms of on the pitch and off the pitch, moving to a new city and so on,"" he said in March. ""It‚Äôs been different, but I knew that it was going to be like that. I knew that it was going to be me stepping out of my comfort zone, but I‚Äôve enjoyed it.

"'At his age, Colwill is the best I've ever seen' - Inside Chelsea's NXGN star's impressive Huddersfield loan","Fans who follow Chelsea's academy sides have known about the potential of Levi Colwill for years, labelling the centre-back 'The new John Terry' as he developed in west London. A season-long loan move to Huddersfield Town in the summer of 2021, therefore, offered Colwill the chance to show why he had garnered such a nickname while playing first-team football. To say Colwill was confident of doing just that would be an understatement. While Terry's famous No.26 shirt has been semi-retired at Chelsea since he left the club in 2017, Colwill wasted no time in picking the same number when he arrived in West Yorkshire. And Colwill has since shown exactly why he has been so regularly compared to the Blues legend. The teenager has made over 20 league starts for Huddersfield over the course of the campaign, putting in a series of impressive performances for a team that finds itself fourth in the Championship and chasing what would be a surprising promotion back to the Premier League. ""On the pitch, how we play and the intensity on the pitch is so different to academy football. It took me a few weeks to get used to it and I am still learning,"" Colwill told GOAL back in September. ""The manager, Carlos Corberan, made a brave choice because, as an 18-year-old coming to the Championship at centre-half from Chelsea, it may have led to everyone asking questions, saying: 'Is he just getting the chance because he came from a big club?' ""I needed to prove myself, but for him to trust me and bring me in, all I can say is thank you for trusting me."" From impersonating Steven Gerrard to impressing Thomas Tuchel üí™ Levi Colwill is following in John Terry's footsteps üîµ pic.twitter.com/FVBBCYUIp3 That trust has been repaid, with Colwill having put in the kind of performances that led to Leicester City attempting to hijack his loan in the January transfer window so he could spend the second half of the season at the King Power Stadium. And he is the latest in a long line of Premier League loanees to have thrived at the John Smith's Stadium. ""We had Ben Chilwell on his first loan from Leicester, we took Trevoh Chalobah from Chelsea, had Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal,"" Leigh Bromby, the ex-Premier League defender who is now head of football operations at Huddersfield, explains to GOAL. ""Before that, we had two Chelsea players in Izzy Brown and Kasey Palmer, while we also got Aaron Mooy in from Man City, and they all came in and did well. ""Now it is Levi's turn as one of our top-end loans, and he has come in and done well."" He adds: ""We looked at Levi last January, so we were aware of him before we signed him. I am sure there was more interest around Levi. ""There were teams aware of him, but luckily for us, we have a really good relationship with Chelsea and a backlog of successful loanees. ""As a person, he has fit in so well. It's his professionalism, the way he has conducted himself and approached the loan has been fantastic. ""Some players come in from bigger clubs and think maybe it will be easy. He has humility and openness to come in and work for his place and buy into what we are doing. ""He has been excellent and is not only a credit to himself but Chelsea, with the way they work with players and prepare them. The way he has fit into the dressing room has been unbelievable. ""The players and staff really like him and love working with him. He's looking to improve and working to get better. Talent-wise, for his age, he is the best I've seen when I've either been playing or coaching. ""The chances, for me, are so high that he will go back and play for Chelsea and England."" Colwill's form saw him recognised this week by NXGN, as he was the only Chelsea player to make the 50-man list of football's best wonderkids for 2022. The 19-year-old is benefitting from Huddersfield's top-flight standard coaching, nutrition and physical performance facilities, while being watched over by the club's loans manager, David Fox. ""You forget he is so young,"" Fox, who had a 15-year professional career after coming through Manchester United's academy, tells GOAL. ""He has literally just turned 19 and played the whole season at 18. His performances, character and mannerisms are not that of a typical 18-year-old. ""He is unbelievably hard-working and humble. He comes from a good upbringing both at home and at Chelsea. ""We wanted him in for pre-season, which gave him time to settle and adjust. He was able to come in, do pre-season, play the pre-season games and bed in with the lads. That was a real positive to get his feet in the door before the season started. ""Chelsea want him in their first team some day, and if we can get him to help him while making him better along the way, then that's what it is about."" It is now a case of which team Colwill will play Premier League football for next season, rather than whether he will play it. Chelsea and Thomas Tuchel will integrate him into the first-team squad in west London during pre-season, meaning a decision on his future is likely to be delayed compared to last summer. Reece James has shown that the step up from the Championship to the Chelsea senior side can be made after he went from a loan spell at Wigan Athletic straight into Frank Lampard's plans in 2019. If there is no space for him next season, though, then he is sure to have options, with Huddersfield hoping they can get themselves to the front of the queue by securing promotion in the coming weeks. But if Colwill does not return to the Terriers following the end of the current campaign, the club can be proud of how it has helped develop another prospective England international. ""We made him better, he made us better and it will help Chelsea in the long run,"" says Bromby. 'The new John Terry' is just getting started.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/colwill-chelsea-nxgn-star-impressive-huddersfield-loan/bltc9ad9a92846ff843,Nizaar Kinsella,cd21bd31-475c-4331-bb4f-3ab6201d2aeb
Roy Keane as Man Utd manager? Red Devils legend says his CV not good enough to replace Rangnick ,"Roy Keane has distanced himself from the permanent manager's position at Manchester United, insisting that his ""CV wouldn't warrant"" consideration as the club seeks to appoint a replacement for interim boss Ralf Rangnick in the summer. United took the decision to sack their last permanent boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, following a poor start to the 2021-22 campaign, with a 4-1 loss at Watford on November 20 proving to be the final straw for the board. Rangnick was called in to steady the ship, but the Red Devils are set to install Solskjaer's long-term successor at the end of the season and the Norwegian's former team-mate Keane has been mooted as a potential candidate. Keane has previously taken in head coaching stints at Sunderland and Ipswich, but has been out of work since leaving his last role as Nottingham Forest assistant in 2019. The 50-year-old, who won seven Premier League titles and the Champions League as a United player, has been quizzed on the possibility of stepping into the Old Trafford dugout by another of his old colleagues. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs never going to happen,‚Äù he replied to Gary Neville on The Overlap Live. ‚ÄúMy CV wouldn‚Äôt warrant it - it‚Äôs as simple as that.

'Nobody remembers the 8-2!' - Lewandowski quizzed on Barca's Champions League humiliation against Bayern,"Robert Lewandowski has claimed that ""no one remembers"" the humiliating 8-2 defeat that Barcelona suffered against Bayern Munich in the Champions League back in 2020. The Poland striker was part of that formidable Bayern team and netted once as Barca were dumped out at the quarter-final stage.  It was also the first time that the Spanish giants had conceded five goals in a Champions League match, but Lewandowski says the defeat has been put firmly in the past. The ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$51m) summer signing, who made his debut for Barca during the 1-0 friendly win over Real Madrid at the weekend, is now fully focused on his duties at Camp Nou and does not wish to dwell on one of the lowest points in the club's history. The 8-2 thrashing was not the first time that Lewandowski won by a huge margin against a Spanish team in the Champions League.  During his stint with Borussia Dortmund, he scored four goals against Real Madrid in another Champions League semifinal as BVB edged out their opponents over two legs to secure a spot in the 2012-13 final.  ""Football is not what you did in the past, it's what you do in the present.¬†Real Madrid's four goals were a long time ago and they are already far behind,"" he said. When pressed on Bayern's memorable victory over Barca two years ago, Lewandowski replied: ""Of that even less.¬†Nobody remembers.""

'De Bruyne is a very unusual player' ‚Äì Belgium boss Martinez assesses Man City star's playing style ,"Belgium boss Roberto Martinez has offered his assessement of Kevin De Bruyne's playing style, describing the Manchester City star as an ""unusual player"". De Bruyne has lived up to his billing as one of the most talented players of his generation since moving to Etihad Stadium from Wolfsburg 2015, putting a disappointing early-career spell at Chelsea firmly behind him. The midfielder has also been a key player for Belgium at international level, most notably spearheading their run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, and Martinez doesn't think there is any other player that boasts the same skillset. De Bruyne has already won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup and four League Cups with City at club level, and is on course to land even more silverware this season. Martinez, who has worked with the 30-year-old for the past six years at international level, believes he is now at his peak. ""Kevin De Bruyne is probably a very unusual player,"" The Belgium manager has told EFE. ""We are used to seeing the player who executes that final pass, who has the great vision of the game, we always think that these players need their time to execute the actions, but Kevin De Bruyne he does it the other way around, he accelerates the tempo of the game. ""He is a creative player very different from what we understand, with great technical capacity, but above all because of the vision he has for spaces and finding the time to give the ball. ""He is now in a team that fights for everything, is in the best moment of his sports career. It is very difficult to find another player who can give that role to another team."" Martinez also discussed another of Belgium's talismanic figures in Eden Hazard, who has endured a dramatic fall from grace since joining Real Madrid from Chelsea in 2009. The 31-year-old has only scored once in 22 games for Madrid in 2021-22 as he continues to struggle with niggling fitness problems, but his international head coach hasn't lost faith in him yet. ""We need Eden Hazard,"" said Martinez. ""We haven't lost him at international level. At club level he doesn't have the relevance or the important role that he has always given to clubs, but his goal is still to be important for the team and help the team. ""Eden is a person who is very clear and rational, he doesn't have an ego that blinds him to what he wants to do.

Azpilicueta transfer still a top priority for Barcelona but Chelsea‚Äôs ‚Ç¨8m asking price holding up deal,"Cesar Apzilicueta remains a top transfer target for Barcelona, but GOAL has learned that Chelsea‚Äôs asking price for their long-serving club captain is proving to be a sticking point. Blaugrana boss Xavi is eager to add more experience to his defensive unit and, fresh from snapping up former Blues centre-half Andreas Christensen as a free agent, has his sights set on a 32-year-old at Stamford Bridge. A move to Camp Nou appeared to be on the cards at one stage, but no agreement has been reached and there are now more obstacles to clear. The Spain international, who can operate at right-back or centre-half, has been registering on Barca‚Äôs radar for several months. He was another of those heading towards free agency in west London this summer, but an automatic 12-month extension clause in his contract was triggered in March once 35 appearances in the 2021-22 campaign were reached. Chelsea‚Äôs new owner, Todd Boehly, has been in Catalunya of late to hold talks with Joan Laporta and Mateu Alemany ‚Äì the president and director of football at Camp Nou ‚Äì with Azpilicueta‚Äôs name cropping up in those discussions. Barca want to sign a Premier League and Champions League-winning star on a two-year contract, but a fee is now being demanded in any deal. 2012: Chelsea sign Cesar Azpilicueta for ¬£7 million ‚úçÔ∏è2022: Cesar Azpilicueta becomes the first player to win every major trophy with Chelsea üèÜ pic.twitter.com/ppwiWC53Fq Chelsea are reluctant to let their skipper walk away for nothing, with GOAL learning that they are looking to recoup the ‚Ç¨8 million (¬£7m/$8m) it cost them to sign Azpilicueta from Marseille in 2012.

Real Madrid welcome big investment deal as Mbappe talks draw to a close,"Real Madrid have announced a deal with investment firm Sixth Street and sports experience outfit Legends worth ‚Ç¨360 million (¬£305m/$381m), the club announced Thursday, as the final touches are reportedly put on Kylian Mbappe's move to Santiago Bernabeu. The Blancos are preparing for both the expected arrival of the France international from Paris Saint-Germain, and a Champions League final date with Liverpool later this month. But off the pitch, the club has confirmed a sizeable outside investment in a two-decade-long partnership that will see them boost their coffers across the board.

The young playmaker's composure has been a feature in his two appearances in pre-season, as well as his constant willingness to show for the ball. With Ten Hag overhauling his midfield this summer, the 19-year-old is determined to make a mark and cement his place in the team in the upcoming season. ‚ÄúI have told myself: ‚ÄòThis could be the only chance I get in the first team‚Äô,"" Iqbal said when quizzed on his impact on United's pre-season tour. ‚ÄúIt has been part of my game since I was young, always wanting the ball.

"'Sometimes it just doesn't work out, Jesse!' - Neville criticises Lingard over Man Utd send-off complaints","Gary Neville says there was no reason Jesse Lingard ""deserved"" an Old Trafford send-off after the Manchester United playmaker failed to appear in the club's final home game of the season against Brentford. It has been another frustrating season for Lingard, who was unable to follow last term's loan move to West Ham with increased minutes under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, as Man Utd have delivered a woefully subpar season ahead of Erik ten Hag's arrival this summer. His absence last week stoked ire from the player's family, and came after reported second-hand comments to Paul Scholes suggesting the dressing room was a ""disaster"" - but now Neville has refuted the idea that Lingard was owed a farewell match. ""There was a lot of nonsense spoken about Lingard,"" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast. ""He's been at the club a long time and done a good job. ""I've seen Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce not play in their last games for the club and not get a send-off in cup finals. They were both great captains and one of them probably is the greatest captain Manchester United have ever had. ""They didn't get the send-off they wanted so I'm not sure why Lingard deserved it. I was thrown away in West Brom in a toilet - sometimes it just doesn't work out, Jesse!"" The former Red Devils star has been among their harshest critics in a campaign that has seen the behind-the-scenes rot at Old Trafford bubble to the surface compared to their big six rivals - and he admits he cannot wait for it to end. ""It's been a shocking few months,"" he added. ""I can't wait for the season to end and to stop talking about them. I can't watch them because it doesn't represent anything that a football club should be, let alone Manchester United. ""The players are only damaging themselves to a point where the fans won't forget. They were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt"" - I have never, ever, heard Man Utd fans resort to that chant.

'Beat Liverpool 4-0!' - Guardiola asks Southampton for help as Premier League title race goes down to the wire,"Pep Guardiola says that Southampton could ""beat Liverpool 4-0"" and do his Manchester City side a massive favour after they were held to a draw by West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. Riyad Mahrez missed a late spot-kick as David Moyes' Hammers ensured a share of the points at London Stadium, to leave the Citizens four points ahead at the summit heading into the final day. Jurgen Klopp's Reds will fulfil their game in hand on Tuesday against Saints, and could close the gap to just the one point heading into a thrilling final day - but Guardiola hopes Ralph Hasenhuttl's men can instead deliver the title to him on a silver platter from St Mary's Stadium. ""Beat Liverpool 4-0!"" Guardiola responded when asked what Southampton could do against his rivals in midweek. He continued: ""Against this Liverpool side you cannot win the league four games ago. You have to fight until the end. The big privilege is that it is at home and it is in our hands."" The Spaniard however insisted that with destiny still in his team's hands, they intended to earn another coronation against Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium, adding: ""I can assure you something. ""In one week, our stadium will be so loud and we will give them all our lives, and they will give us their lives for 95 minutes. It's an incredible privilege to win one game at home to be champion."" Even though Liverpool have two games left compared to just the one for the Citizens, Guardiola knows that victory over Villa - coached by former Reds legend Steven Gerrard - confirms a successful title defence in Manchester. A draw meanwhile would still be enough if their rivals fail to win both of their final games - against Saints and Wolves - but would otherwise open the door for Klopp to claim victory if he picks up the maximum six points. Defeat would be the worst case scenario - and yet, it could be moot if the Reds fail to win at St Mary's Stadium, with such a result ensuring the four-point gap stays intact with a maximum of three points left to play for.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/beat-liverpool-4-0-guardiola-asks-southampton-for-help-as/blt12a731fdda1554d3,Andrew Steel,404f3c06-df45-4038-a652-e31bd6712dd1
Latest Orlando Pirates strike partnership miss-firing?,"The combination of Kwame Peprah and Kabelo Dlamini up front for Orlando Pirates in recent weeks is seemingly failing to inspire. Both players were also taken off the last time they started together, two games back against Sekhukhune United, as well as three games ago ‚Äì versus Al Ittihad.  In short, there has not been much to suggest there is a chemistry between the pair.   Individually neither man seems to be on top of their games right now either. After a fruitful spell just before Christmas, Peprah has netted just twice in 16 outings and is currently on a goal drought of eight games. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to give someone like Zakhele Lepasa a chance. Yes he‚Äôs coming back from injury, but could perhaps play the first 60 to 70 minutes. His guile and pace would offer something different. There are of course also options such as Tshegofatso Mabasa and Gabadinho Mhango, who should probably be Bucs‚Äô first-choice strike partnership, but who for varying reasons, barely get any game-time. Dlamini has managed three goals in his last 10 appearances, but the 25-year-old still lacks consistency in his game and is probably better suited playing as a traditional winger. If the Pirates coaches are thinking about getting a bit more adventurous at home for the second leg against Simba, perhaps it‚Äôs time to unleash Thembinkosi Lorch. He remained on the bench on Sunday. Lorch is another who‚Äôs output has been well below expected, but remains a player who can be a game-changer and a match-winner. At this crunch juncture of the season, the timing could just be right for former Bafana Bafana star Lorch to spearhead Bucs‚Äô run in the knockout stages of the Confederation Cup. Sunday‚Äôs match against Simba was a tight one and decided only by a controversial penalty. One gets the feeling though that the game had been there for the taking if Pirates had been a little more adventurous; hopefully they‚Äôll go with a more incisively attitude for the return game in a week‚Äôs time in Soweto.

"Sunderland forced me to play despite having coronavirus, claims Bayern Munich loanee keeper Hoffman","Bayern Munich goalkeeper Ron-Thorben Hoffmann has claimed he was forced to play while suffering from coronavirus during a loan spell with Sunderland last season. The former Germany youth international was loaned to the Black Cats and made almost two-dozen appearances for them across the course of the season before he was replaced by Anthony Patterson for the successful run-in to the League One playoff final at Wembley.

Wiegman was ecstatic after the win as England will now have a shot at the European Championship trophy against either Germany or France on July 31 at Wembley. She thinks that the convincing victory at such a crucial stage of the tournament will not only be an inspiration to the country but also a statement to their main rivals. ""We said before the tournament and throughout that, we want to inspire the nation, I think that's what we're doing and making a difference.

Sancho explains how he can avoid being a ¬£73m flop during second season at Man Utd,"Jadon Sancho feels better placed to make a positive impact at Manchester United during his second season at Old Trafford, with the England international looking to avoid being written off as a ¬£73 million ($88m) flop. Big money was invested in his ability during the summer of 2021, but a debut campaign with the Red Devils delivered only five goals and three assists through 38 appearances in all competitions. He has been looking lively in pre-season, with the target found on three occasions in four games, and the 22-year-old forward believes there is more to come from him as an individual and United as a collective as they open an exciting new era under the guidance of Erik ten Hag. Sancho has said of proving his worth at Old Trafford as the World Cup finals in Qatar also figure prominently in his thoughts: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my second year now, settling into the team, knowing how players play and I‚Äôm excited for the upcoming season, with a new manager and how he wants us to play. ‚ÄúI think it will be good for myself. The training, especially in pre-season, has been a real positive and all the lads have taken on board what he‚Äôs saying. ‚ÄúYou can see it in the games, we‚Äôre creating a lot more chances, keeping the ball more and just making good things out of the style we‚Äôre playing. This is my first pre-season with United because, last year, I had an infection in my ear, so I couldn‚Äôt do the whole pre-season with the team which was a bit annoying at the time. ‚ÄúIt meant a lack of fitness and understanding of how the players play. But now, this season, I feel a lot more comfortable and, especially scoring in pre-season, it is a confidence boost for myself and, hopefully, I can take that into the season and keep it going. ‚ÄúThis pre-season, we have the same players, but it just looks like a whole different team and I do think that‚Äôs something we‚Äôre working on and I feel like we‚Äôre getting better. ‚ÄúThe manager is big on team-bonding and having fun together and doing things like team dinners and things like that.

Confusion over ¬£4m Maradona shirt as his family says auction item is NOT the one he wore scoring 'Hand of God' goal against England,"Confusion reigns regarding the impending sale of a Diego Maradona shirt, with the Argentine‚Äôs family claiming that a jersey expected to fetch ¬£4 million ($5m) at auction is not the one in which an all-time great scored his famous ‚ÄòHand of God‚Äô goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.

Watch: Dortmund II keeper Unbehaun concedes bizarre goal after throwing ball to Wiesbaden striker,"Borussia Dortmund II goalkeeper Luca Unbehaun conceded a bizarre goal in a clash with Wehen Wiesbaden after throwing the ball out to opposition striker Gustaf Nilsson. The two teams opened their respective 3.Liga campaigns with a 1-1 draw at the BRITA Arena on Monday. Dortmund had Rodney Elongo-Yombo to thank for scoring a 77th minute equaliser after Unbehaun gifted the hosts the opening goal of the game shortly after the interval. Unbehaun gathered an overhit long-ball deep in his own penalty area in the 56th minute, but then threw the ball out in front of him because he apparently thought he had heard the referee whistle for a free-kick. Nilsson briefly turned around to check that the ball was in play before prodding it onto his right foot and firing low into the bottom corner of the net, and the referee allowed the goal to stand - much to Unbehaun's dismay.

"Osasuna vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona aim to get back to winning ways on Sunday when they visit Osasuna's El Sadar stadium on matchday 17 of La Liga. Xavi Hernandez's men suffered a crushing 3-0 defeat in midweek at the hands of Bayern Munich to confirm their elimination from the Champions League, while domestically the Blaugrana have also been struggling. Last weekend saw them beaten 1-0 at home by Real Betis and the Catalans are currently 16 points behind leaders Real Madrid. The hosts have only recorded one victory in front of their own fans all season and Osasuna can be backed at 3/1 (4.00) with bet365 to claim three points on Sunday. Barcelona, meanwhile, are available at 10/11 (1.91) to record what would be only their second away win of the current campaign while the draw is priced at 5/2 (3.50). Los Rojillos are likely to welcome back striker Kike Garcia from injury and the former Eibar forward can be backed at 7/1 (8.00) to break the deadlock. For the Blaugrana, Memphis Depay is the shortest priced player to score first at 4/1 (5.00) with Luuk de Jong at 5/1 (6.00) and Ousmane Dembele at 6/1 (7.00). Traditionally, El Sadar is one of the toughest grounds to visit in La Liga and, despite Osasuna's home form this season being indifferent, Barcelona can be assured of a hostile reception in Pamplona on Sunday. One of the division's loudest and most intimidating grounds is sold out and the game will provide a real test of character for a young Barca side at its lowest ebb for a while. Jordi Alba is missing for the visitors and with Osasuna a side that love to attack down the flanks, it could be a tough afternoon for the Catalan defence against an intense and aggressive side. Osasuna are priced at 11/10 (2.10) to score in the second half and this looks like an attractive option. Barca have conceded second-half goals in four of their last five league matches and there has been a trend for them to start brightly but fade badly.

Haaland wrote on Twitter: ""I was given advice by a farmer a few years back: let your feet do the talking and everything else will be fine.  ""I said okay and walked away."" Norway coach Stale Solbakken confirmed last week that the Borussia Dortmund star had requested he be kept away from media duties while with Norway over the last week. ""He has expressed to me that he would like to be screened a little,"" the coach told reporters.  ""He explained to me why. He explained to me in a nice and factual way, and a very convincing way that he needs it.  ""I see no reason not to respect that. When we meet next time [in June], Erling will be sitting here answering questions from you. Then that saga will be over."" Norwegian outlet NRK has managed to track down the farmer who passed on the advice to Haaland, revealing it to be former footballer Gabriel Hoyland. The former striker is regarded as Norwegian side Byrne's greatest ever players and still has the club's record in appearances, having made 595 matches. The 67-year-old has since turned to farming while he also helps develop young players, and he has confirmed that he was the man behind the wise words. ""My son contacted Erling and got confirmation that it was me he was talking about,"" he said.¬† ""I did not feel completely recognisable, but when Erling says that, I believe him.¬†If he remembers it, it must have been useful.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-was-given-advice-by-a-farmer-dortmund-s-haaland-addresses-lack-/blt86921d9c8c072711,By Peter McVitie,57bc55c2-59a0-4c58-b8bc-7c0ed33e9d29
'Proper game' - McTominay shows off battle scars after Man Utd beat rivals Leeds in Premier League clash,"Scott McTominay showed off his battle scars after Manchester United's thrilling win over rivals Leeds, which he labelled a ""proper game"". United boosted their chances of finishing in the Premier League top four by beating Leeds 4-2 at Elland Road on Sunday afternoon. Goals from Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes, Fred and Anthony Elanga gave Ralf Rangnick's side all three points as they battled through extreme weather conditions and silenced the passionate home crowd. McTominay played the full 90 minutes of the derby clash and was in the thick of the action right from the first whistle. The 25-year-old picked up a yellow card, but was also on the wrong end of a number of late challenges. He took to social media after the game to post pictures of a memorable occasion, including a series of cuts that had been left around his ankle with the caption: ""Leeds away - a proper game"".",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mctominay-battle-scars-man-utd-leeds-premier-league/blt920f2252fcc9a966,James Westwood,179aa892-662b-4070-bdf4-6a38a47171de
James Rodriguez open to Everton return after being forced out by Benitez,"James Rodriguez claims he would be open to returning to Everton after seeing a move away from a ‚Äúspectacular club‚Äù forced by former Toffees boss Rafa Benitez. The Colombian playmaker made a stunning switch to Goodison Park during the summer of 2020, as he was reunited with former Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti on Merseyside. He struggled to make an impact in English football, though, and was offloaded to Qatari side Al-Rayyan in September 2021 by a Spanish coach that showed no faith in him. James has said during a discussion on Twitch: ""Go back to Everton one day? Of course I would go back to Everton. It's a spectacular club with incredible fans, but I found a coach who didn't want to count on me.  ""I wanted to stay there but the manager didn't want to count on me. Until the last day I was super-professional and I trained to the fullest.  ""I wanted to be remembered as I am, a good person and a great professional. It was the coach's decision. Some people love you and others don't, you have to respect that."" The South American arrived at Goodison Park amid much fanfare, but departed having taken in just 26 appearances for the club. He did register six Premier League goals through 23 top-flight outings, and eight assists in all competitions, but never really got going with the Toffees. A new challenge has now been taken on in the Middle East, with those left behind at Goodison Park battling to avoid relegation. Benitez paid the price for those struggles with his job in January, with an ex-Liverpool coach never winning over a sceptical fan base, and Frank Lampard is now calling the shots. James was not the only one to be left surprised when an exit door was flung open in front of him by Benitez, with Everton forward Richarlison questioning the decision to let a proven playmaker leave. He has told TNT Sports of sales sanctioned by the Toffees: ‚ÄúWhen I arrived from the Olympics, I was surprised at how much he (James) was running and dedicating himself to training, training well. ‚ÄúAnd out of nowhere, the coach (Benitez) said he didn‚Äôt count on him any more. And nobody understood anything. ‚ÄúSo I think that also weighed a little on the group. Because we know about James‚Äô quality. Also from [Lucas] Digne, who we ended up losing. So it weighs, it weighs. Like it or not, it weighs on the group. ‚ÄúWe had a united group there and ended up losing two important players. So I think that‚Äôs it. James, we wish him all the best. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs it. We lost Bernard too, who was an important player. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs like I said, we had everything to reach the Europa League or the Champions League and we lose players so easily. Lose players through injury too. It ends up making competition difficult.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/james-rodriguez-open-everton-return-forced-out-benitez/bltb058fe0f98784b67,Chris Burton,f164ce72-161a-4ad2-926a-4889226bdf6c
'This is my journey' - USWNT star Huerta on battling anxiety and helping the next generation,"As the national anthems played ahead of a clash between her two cultures, Mexican-American full-back Sofia Huerta found herself struggling with a familiar question: Who do I really want to be? This was back in 2013 in Washington, and Huerta had made her choice. She had chosen to represent the country of her father: Mexico. But, as the Star-Spangled Banner played ahead of a friendly against the U.S., Huerta couldn't help but think about who she really was. ""[Playing for Mexico] was a great experience for me. I got to play internationally at a really young age,"" Huerta tells GOAL. ""And it actually made me realise what I knew all along: that I actually wanted to play for the U.S. ""Hearing that American national anthem, I just thought, 'Oh, I just resonate with this more right now and that feels more true to me.' ""I love that I'm Mexican, that was just what my dream was... A lot of people were giving me their advice and letting me know that I made the wrong decision. I took it all with a grain of salt. ""This is my journey. I know what I can really do."" To understand the context of Huerta's journey, you need to understand the context of Huerta's upbringing. friday.gif pic.twitter.com/bdfIXXWgUp Her father, Mauricio, had emigrated to the U.S. from Puebla, Mexico, settling in Boise. And, for those that don't know, Idaho is neither a hotbed of Mexican culture nor a prime developer of soccer talent. And so Huerta had a different kind of upbringing, one that saw her connect with her Mexican roots even if few around her truly understood them. ""I think my whole life I've kind of identified with being Mexican-American,"" Huerta says. ""I think it was a different experience growing up in Idaho, which is obviously a more low-diverse area. ""And so I always knew that I was different."" Different she was. Huerta emerged as a multisport star in Boise, winning Idaho's Gatorade Player of the Year award twice in soccer. She caught the eye of Santa Clara University, one of the premier women's soccer programs in the country. By 2012, her sophomore year of college, she was playing for Mexico, having previously represented the U.S. at the U-20 level. The decision to play for Mexico, at the time, gave her a source of pride and a chance to represent her father and all of the family in his homeland. In December 2014, after a period of soul searching, she announced she would not continue to play for Mexico. The switch, ultimately, took nearly three years. After that wait, Huerta had hopes that it was her time, her chance to finally seal her spot on the USWNT squad. But, after just seven caps, she found herself out of the picture. It was at that time that Huerta felt most alone. After several seasons in the NWSL that saw her bounce from position to position with the Chicago Red Stars and Houston Dash, she embarked on two loan spells to Australia, far from home and seemingly further away from her national team dreams. Nowhere near the USWNT and with her time as a Mexican international long gone, Huerta had moments of regret. Huerta looked back on her initial impressions with the USWNT and believed she'd squandered her chance. She looked back at all of the times where she didn't give as much as she could have . She'd heard the criticism from those that said she never should have left. She remembered everyone who told her she wasn't good enough for the USWNT. And, at that time, she started to believe them. ""Personally, I doubted my viability a lot during those years,"" she said. ""I had a lot of regret in terms of how I acted during my time with the national team. ""I feel like I wasn't as professional as I should have been. I wasn't doing everything I could to make sure that I was getting called in every time. ""In the years where I wasn't getting called in, you have to really sit with those feelings, and that's really uncomfortable. I really don't wish that upon anyone. ""I would kind of regret what I did in the past and then I would get anxious about the future and whether I was ever going to get the opportunity again, and that was not helping me at all. In fact, it was actually hurting me, I wasn't playing to my best ability and I just wasn't enjoying what I was doing. ""That was something I also had to kind of think about like 'I'm a professional soccer player!' Just because I'm not on the national team doesn't mean that I'm not a badass and that I hadn't made it this far. I had to change the narrative."" That, Huerta says, is still a process that is ongoing, even if circumstances have changed massively since those years in the wilderness. She's worked with a life coach since she has left college, and she believes that taking care of her mental health in that way has helped propel her to where she is now. The 29-year-old defender has become an important piece at OL Reign, one of the NWSL's top clubs. Having previously played just about everywhere on the field, including striker, Huerta is now one of American soccer's top right-backs. Huerta is also back with the USWNT, a key figure as they head into the CONCACAF W Championship. After all of those years of waiting, Huerta has now featured in five of the USWNT's eight matches so far in 2022. The success is a long time coming, but Huerta knows it can all go away in the blink of an eye. ""[Seeing my life coach] isn't something that you do for like a week and then like your life has changed,"" she says. ""I'm personally, always, every day growing. ""Like, it may seem like I know everything that I'm doing and that I don't have performance anxiety and that I play so many games so I'm fine. No, every day challenges me. Every day is something new. ""One day can be great and the next day, it's not so great. I think the main idea and point is that a lot of things are out of your control and all you can really do is have a short-term memory and move forward. ""A lot of people don't really talk about their mental health because I don't think people are really aware of anxiety or whatever it is and that's something I've always been super hyperaware of, and I think that it's really just helped me in all aspects of my life."" All these years later, Huerta has developed a bit of perspective. She realises that, in some ways, she was one of the lucky ones. ""Being from Idaho, I just was not at a place where I was seen or had exposure or was given many opportunities in terms of getting recruited and seen by college coaches,"" she says. ""If you're from like California, you're being seen every weekend from like some of the top colleges. ""For me, particularly that was not the case. Being Mexican-American did also get in the way. I feel like even when my club team would go on trips, my family, unfortunately, could not afford for me to go on that trip, so I just wasn't getting the exposure. And that was something that was really, really hard for me. ""I had those thoughts about how I was playing with these girls and they're also good but, unfortunately, because of the lack of resources and quite honestly because we're from Idaho, they just weren't given the opportunities. ""That happens all over, whether it's monetary reasons or where you're from. A lot of people are missing out on such great opportunities."" With that in mind, Huerta has recently partnered with Signing Day Sports, a college recruiting platform that uses technology to help players that are out of focus, players like Huerta, get their chance in the spotlight. Signing Day recently expanded to soccer, with the platform allowing athletes from all over the U.S. to upload footage, answer interview questions and, most importantly, connect with college coaches. It's a platform that Huerta believes would have helped so many girls like her get seen by the right people. ""I really think about what it would be like if this platform was available to me when I was going through the recruiting process,"" she says. ""I think it would have made it much easier. ""I think it would have been great just to have this platform to interact with coaches and to put myself out there because I think a lot of coaches didn't see my value, which obviously affected my recruiting process. ""Even though I'm very happy with where my journey has taken me, I just think that this is such an important platform for people because it helps athletes get discovered and recruited by college coaches across the country, which is something that is not easy. ""A lot of people just aren't seen."" Huerta has earned her moment in the spotlight and, if all goes to plan, there's a chance she could earn a chance to play at the biggest stage. The World Cup is just a year away with the Olympics coming up in 2024, and Huerta has reason to believe she could finally get that chance. It would be a dream come true for Huerta, the Mexican-American girl from Boise that overcame a lack of exposure, her own anxiety and a battle within herself just to make it this far. But, before she can look ahead to those moments, her story has another very fitting chapter to be written. Coincidentally, the CONCACAF W Championship take place in Mexico as Huerta returns to face the country of her father. The USWNT's third match of the group stage will be against the hosts, perhaps putting Huerta against Mexico with a World Cup spot on the line. She'll hear those same national anthems that she heard nine years ago but, this time, she'll be on the other side. The side she truly wants to be on.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-star-huerta-battling-anxiety-helping-next-generation/blt079396f26c817347,Ryan Tolmich,e41a5fc3-97fd-4089-af52-224b0ff84d73
Watch: Glorious Morata assist helps Juventus snatch late point against Bologna,"Alvaro Morata snatched an outstanding assist deep into injury time for Juventus, as the Bianconeri star's attempted overhead kick finish was headed home by Dusan Vlahovic to seal a 1-1 comeback draw against Bologna in Serie A. The hosts had been chasing a result against their heroically stubborn visitors for much of the second half in Turin, but had looked poised to leave empty-handed five minutes after regular time. But after a corner, Morata attempted to flick a return header in with an outrageous overhead kick, one which was safely guided home at the far post by Vlahovic to further bolster their top four spot.

Kelechi Nwakali: Huesca terminate ex-Arsenal midfielder‚Äôs contract,"Former Arsenal player Kelechi Nwakali is now a free agent after Huesca terminated his contract on Tuesday.¬† In the 2021-22 campaign, he featured in 19 league games before joining the Nigeria national team for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Since his return after the Super Eagles' failed expedition in Cameroon, he was considered for action by manager Xisco Munoz at his club. However, the Aragon team confirmed in a statement on their website that they have parted ways with the former Nigeria U17 captain but could not divulge the reason behind the decision. ‚ÄúSociedad Deportiva Huesca have terminated the contractual relationship maintained by the first team player Kelechi Nwakali with the Barca entity,‚Äù the club wrote in a statement. ‚ÄúThe club has informed the player of the decision to terminate the contract that united both in the current campaign but expired in June 2022.¬† ‚ÄúSD Huesca wishes Nwakali the best in his professional future.‚Äù Nwakali was named the Fifa U17 World Cup player of the tournament in Chile in 2015 after a resounding performance with Nigeria and had caught the attention of Arsenal. Following his inability to break into Arsenal‚Äôs first team, the Gunners sent the Nigerian to Dutch second division side MVV Maastricht. He enjoyed further spells at VVV-Venlo and FC Porto B before he was shipped out of the Emirates Stadium for a move to Huesca. In his maiden season at the Estadio El Alcoraz, he featured in just five games as the Spaniards got promoted to the Spanish elite division.¬† Huesca‚Äôs demotion to the second-tier saw him sent to Alcorcon for the remainder of the 2020-21 campaign.¬† His former coach at U17 level Emmanuel Amuneke had told GOAL¬†what the midfielder must do to justify his potential.‚ÄúThere is nothing to doubt about Nwakali‚Äôs talent.

Chelsea deny Alonso bust-up after players forced to train on day off following Wolves capitulation,"Thomas Tuchel did drag his Chelsea squad in for extra training the day after they blew a two-goal lead at home to Wolves, GOAL can confirm, but the Blues have denied that Marcos Alonso was involved in any bust-up. Top-four hopefuls from Stamford Bridge appeared to be cruising to three much-needed points in their latest outing after seeing Romelu Lukaku ‚Äì who was returned to their starting XI after recent questions of his form ‚Äì net twice in the space of as many minutes shortly before the hour mark. A late capitulation saw a winless run extended to three games, though, as Francisco Trincao snatched a lifeline for Wolves and Conor Coady netted a 97th-minute equaliser. Demanding German tactician Tuchel was less than impressed with the efforts of his side as they allowed London rivals Arsenal to close to within a point of their third-placed standing, with Tottenham only five points adrift of the Blues. He did request that all players report to Chelsea‚Äôs training base at Cobham on Sunday for a team meeting, with a scheduled day off being cancelled. Those players that were involved in a 2-2 draw with Wolves were asked to carry out gym work, while those that made the bench or were left out of the matchday squad entirely underwent an extra session on the field. It was, however, a meeting in which an untimely dip in form was discussed that became the main focus of the day ‚Äì with Chelsea readying themselves for an FA Cup final date with Liverpool at Wembley on Saturday. The Blues need to raise their game for that contest, but have already taken in 59 games this season across all competitions and are in danger of allowing fatigue to set in. Subequently, Tuchel responding to these reports, insisting it wasn't a punishment but that he thought this would be the best way to get over letting an important lead slip.  ‚ÄúYeah, we came in,"" he admitted. ""We planned a free day but after the disappointment it was not even to punish them. It was normally a free day and maybe some felt it was a punishment. It wasn‚Äôt.  ""It was not the moment for a free day, it is better to be together and talk about it than to go and everybody has his own opinion, own truth. You have more risk to be in fragments than to be here. We did very light training, had a run together and discussed things, how to approach the next days.  ""We brought everybody together to have the chance to be together. A lot of players supported the Under-23‚Äôs on the other pitch which was very nice. That‚Äôs what we are. Very supportive, open minded group of players. That‚Äôs what it felt like on Sunday.  ""That‚Äôs what the Sunday morning was for, not to punish them or do a video session and show the mistakes or behaviour we could have done better. It was just to be together and not in different groups away from each other on a free day. That‚Äôs why we put everybody in.‚Äù 90+7' Chelsea 2-2 Wolves Chelsea fans: pic.twitter.com/r25sSWpcaP There were suggestions on the back of a disappointing outing against Wolves that Spanish defender Alonso was involved in a heated exchange with Tuchel after being replaced by Saul Niguez at half-time. GOAL has learned that was not the case, with the buccaneering left-back in line to figure against Leeds on Wednesday. Tuchel offered no indication on the back of the Blues‚Äô last outing that he had any issue with Alonso, with a tactical tweak made during the interval intended to make his side tighter at the back. He told the club‚Äôs official website when asked about his changes at the break: ‚ÄúMarcos was not injured, it was just a decision we made. ‚ÄúAzpi [Cesar Azpilicueta] had a yellow card and he was very active in the first half but he was too offensive. He took too many risks there and sometimes we only had Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] as the spare player in the two v twos and that‚Äôs why we changed. Azpi had a yellow card and we wanted the runs from him in the second half.‚Äù Adding about the supposed bust up several days later: ""It started and ended in the first half [on the pitch].

'Pep's style is unique' - Why Man City's ¬£100m man Grealish will explode in second season under Guardiola,"Second-season syndrome is not uncommon in football. After a standout campaign, some players or teams are unable to reach the same level and suffer an alarming dip in form.¬†But, at Manchester City, it can mean the opposite. It can sometimes take at least a year working under and learning from Pep Guardiola before a player can feel entirely settled in the Catalan's meticulously drilled team.¬† Joao Cancelo, Riyad Mahrez and Rodri all struggled to make a big impact in their debut campaigns at the club but all were crucial in last season‚Äôs successful title defence.¬† Performance analysis coach Carles Planchart says he has verifiable data that can show how a player evolves over their first two seasons working under the Catalan coach. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a relaxed and confident attitude around Jack Grealish after a debut season at the Etihad Stadium when he didn‚Äôt make quite the impact he would have wanted. ‚ÄúI remember thinking that if I played in a team like City‚Äôs, I‚Äôd score so many goals, get so many assists but it hasn‚Äôt been like that,‚Äù the attacker told the club‚Äôs media after six goals and four assists in the season that followed his ¬£100 million ($120m) move from Aston Villa.¬† Guardiola has said he should ignore the statistics and insists he is happy with the contribution he made to a team that won the title and, but for a brilliant save from Real Madrid‚Äôs Thibaut Courtois to deny Grealish in the semi-final, would have reached a second successive Champions League final. City legend Joleon Lescott says playing for the City coach is unlike anything Grealish will have experienced before, so it's only natural that he didn't slot right into the side. ¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the rhythm and the understanding of the team, it‚Äôs totally new and Pep‚Äôs style is unique,‚Äù the BT Sport pundit tells GOAL. ‚ÄúNumerous other coaches have tried to emulate Guardiola's approach but it's hard. I'm sure that Jack is now aware of what the requirements are, and where he needs to be.¬† ‚û°Ô∏è @KevinDeBruyne ‚û°Ô∏è @JackGrealish ‚öΩÔ∏è @ErlingHaaland ‚öΩÔ∏è#ManCity | @Sure pic.twitter.com/eaoGPnZsut ‚ÄúIt's about recognising the patterns and understanding your team-mates, whichever full-back is playing behind and knowing what are their strengths. ‚ÄúWith the greatest respect to Aston Villa, Jack was that guy who had to create the moments. Now he can react and have someone else create for him to finish them off.‚Äù The upheaval involved in Grealish moving to Manchester last year shouldn't be underestimated. He had to leave the club he joined as a six-year-old and found himself in a new city, in a new team, surrounded by superstars. A pre-season tour to the United States this July saw the first-team squad working hard to get up to speed for the new season but a relaxed environment helped them to bond with dinners and events during their time in Houston and Green Bay. Grealish struck up a blossoming bromance with new signing Erling Haaland, and assisted his first goal in a sky blue shirt in the 1-0 win over Bayern Munich, and is already close to many members of the squad, including England team-mate Phil Foden. Former England defender Lescott was in the US and was impressed by his impact on the pitch in the high-profile friendlies with Mexican side Club America and Bayern. That individual skill and flair was back at the forefront and was his belief to keep running at defenders and creating attacking situations. ¬† ‚ÄúI liked that in the first game he should have had three penalties ‚Äì blatant penalties,‚Äù Lescott says. ‚ÄúBut what I liked most was his temperament, he didn‚Äôt let it affect his game in terms of reacting negatively. He just said ‚ÄòOkay, well give me the ball and I‚Äôll make things happen.' ‚ÄúHe went through one incident and had a reaction with Club America goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa and after the fans treated him like a pantomime villain, booing him.¬† ‚ÄúBut he rose to the challenge and it spurred him on and he's going to have to prepare for that this season, as there are going to be games when players and fans in particular will try to get under his skin.‚Äù The best of... @JackGrealish! ‚ú®#ManCity pic.twitter.com/uBu6zQy34D Grealish has always had something of a target on his back, both on and off the pitch. His ability to draw fouls often only further infuriates opponents.¬† Away fans will always jump on any mistake made by the British football's most expensive player ever, while some pundits will see his big transfer fee as a way to justify criticism if he‚Äôs not impacting games. Lescott, though, insists that the price tag is irrelevant. ‚ÄúPlayers are not in control of transfer fees, so it's unfair to justify his performances by that transfer fee,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhether he cost ¬£10m or ¬£200m, I'm sure he would have wanted to post bigger numbers ‚Äì every player wants to improve regardless of the fee. ‚ÄúBut he seems relaxed and he should be, because he's been there a year, he knows the players and the staff and, knowing Jack, he'll embrace the expectation of this season.‚Äù Guardiola has shown his confidence in Grealish by allowing Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus ‚Äì potential challengers for his starting position ‚Äì to join title rivals Chelsea and Arsenal, respectively.  A year after his arrival at the Etihad, the belief in his huge potential has only grown rather than diminished. Don't be at all surprised, then, if Grealish becomes the next City star to explode in his second season under Pep. Believe it? Now See it on BT Sport!

PSG ultras call for president Al-Khelaifi to leave after Champions League collapse,"Representatives of Paris Saint-Germain's ultra fan groups have called for president Nasser Al-Khelaifi to step down from his role immediately.  PSG were humbled by Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday, letting slip a two-goal lead to seal their elimination from the competition at the last-16 stage.  With the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar leading a star-studded team, first place in Ligue 1 appears to be insufficient to quell supporters' rage at failing to deliver in Europe.  ‚ÄúThe unacceptable and inevitable disappointment that we feared and foresaw has unfortunately come to pass,"" the statement issued by the Collectif Ultra Paris begins. ""How can you have the mindset to move mountains when your season seems to begin in February and you play domestic competitions at a pedestrian pace? C'est l'heure... DIRECTION D√âMISSION !!!@PSG_inside pic.twitter.com/y9ELoVKHaV ""How can you have a genuine game plan when your squad is nothing but a bunch of ‚Äòstars‚Äô who barely complement one another? ""How can a coach be the respected leader of the changing room when he is clearly not the true decision maker? ""How can you rebuild a squad when eternal substitutes can happily see out their contracts with such comfortable salaries?"" The Collectif's statement continues to demand the exit of Al-Khelaifi, affirming that: ""We don't have a short memory. We know what our return owes to president¬†Nasser Al-Khelaifi¬†but it is clear he is not the man for the job. ""The club's current situation requires complete reorganisation at all levels going forward and the daily presence of its president."" The current president took over in 2011 at the head of new owners the Qatar Sports Investments, and has overseen massive spending at the club and an unprecedented run of domestic success.  The Champions League title, though, has remained elusive, with Wednesday's collapse the latest setback for PSG.  Al-Khelaifi was left fuming at elimination, even attempting to storm into the referees' dressing room after the match in Madrid to protest their failure to disallow Karim Benzema's first goal for a supposed infraction in the build-up.

Chelsea monitoring Lewandowski transfer situation as wantaway Bayern Munich star linked with Barcelona,"Chelsea are watching the situation around Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski, who has opted not to renew his contract after interest from Barcelona.  The 33-year-old has just one year left on his current deal with the German giants and his desire to leave is now public.  Barca are targeting a deal but have work to do first in order to avoid La Liga's Financial Fair Play (FFP) sanctions and are concerned that Thomas Tuchel's personal interest could play a part in the Pole's decision. Currently, Chelsea are sanctioned and unable to make transfers ‚Äì but that's projected to end soon, with the Todd Boehly takeover into the final administrative details.  After that, they will begin planning their summer, as they are already behind most of Europe's big clubs who have started to make moves for new players.  Chelsea have long seen Lewandowski among the world's best strikers and have struggled to fill such a position ever since they sold Diego Costa to Atletico Madrid in 2018. Nor would this be the first time the Blues have been interested in bringing the Poland international to Stamford Bridge, having tried to sign him at least three times in the past.  It is believed that as well as a long-standing interest, Tuchel would be open to working with the veteran forward too. ‚ÄúI can confirm that I spoke to Hasan [Salihamidzic, sporting director] and informed him that I am not extending my contract with Bayern,‚Äù Lewandowski explained to Sky on Saturday. ‚ÄúBoth sides have to think about the future. It's best if we find the best solution for both sides. ‚ÄúI said [to Salihamidzic] that if an offer comes, then we have to think about it - also for the club. Both sides have to think about the future. That's all I can say.‚Äù Salihamidzic also spoke to Sky this weekend, stating: ‚ÄúI spoke to Lewa. In the conversation he told me that he did not want to accept our offer to extend the contract and that he would like to leave the club. ‚ÄúHe said that he would like to do something else but our attitude hasn't changed. ‚ÄúLewa has a contract until June 30, 2023. That's a fact. I don't deal with that because our stance has always been clear.‚Äù In short, yes, Romelu Lukaku would would have to be sold. Unfortunately, part of the government restrictions have forced players to stay and any move for Lewandowski is contingent on what happens with the Belgian. The ¬£100 million ($136m) record signing from Inter has rumoured interest from Italy, but his ¬£325,000-a-week wages are a major stumbling block. There have been no active talks to force a move away over the summer, with the Belgian instructing his entourage that he wants to get the most out of his season first. However, it is clear that Tuchel has been unwilling to adapt his style of play to suit Lukaku and that the striker has been unable to slot into the German's tactical formations. Indeed, the signing of Lukaku came after Chelsea held talks over moves with other options last summer, including Lewandowski, Tottenham's Harry Kane and Manchester City-bound Erling Haaland. None were viable so Lukaku was signed instead.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-lewandowski-transfer-bayern-munich-linked-barcelona/bltda63cc832fc32a45,Nizaar Kinsella,d5b537d0-4ab9-40f3-8005-63954a5a0083
"Sheffield United vs Nottingham Forest: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Sheffield United host Nottingham Forest in the first leg of their Championship play-off semi-final on Saturday. The home team booked their place in the play-offs by going on a three-game winning run to finish fifth in the second tier, one place behind their weekend opponents. At 6/5 (2.2) with bet365 to claim victory, Sheffield United are slight favourites to win the first leg of the tie. Nottingham Forest can be backed at 13/5 (3.6) and the draw is set at 21/10 (3.1). Sheffield United stars Billy Sharp and William Osula are 11/2 (6.5) to break the deadlock in the first leg. Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest striker Lewis Grabban is 6/1 (7.0). Nottingham Forest had a disappointing end to the season, collecting one point from their last two matches, but they had already secured their place in the play-offs by that point. Sheffield United, however, are in fine form heading into this match after they went four games in a row without defeat to be sure of a place in the top six. However, the home team have a bit of an injury crisis to contend with heading into this game.  Billy Sharp, David McGoldrick, Rhian Brewster and Oliver McBurnie are all missing for United, while Keinan Davis, Max Lowe and Lewis Grabban are out for the visitors. There have been under 2.5 goals in the last five matches between these teams, which can be backed at 4/7 (1.57) to come through this week.

USMNT's McKennie hobbles off injured in final moments of Juve's clash with Villarreal,"Weston McKennie was forced out of Tuesday's clash with Villarreal as the U.S. men's national team midfielder hobbled off injured in the game's waning moments. The midfielder was injured on a tackle from Pervis Estupinan, with McKennie going down clutching his ankle as Juve settled for a 1-1 draw. After a visit from the medical team, McKennie hobbled off with the assistance of trainers as he was replaced by Denis Zakaria. McKennie has been a massive presence for Juventus in recent weeks, becoming an indispensable part of the team's midfield. Manager Massimiliano Allegri recently said McKennie offers qualities to Juventus that ""other midfielders don‚Äôt"", further highlighting his importance to the team.

A change of position and chats with Rangnick - How Sancho found his form at Man Utd,"When Manchester United secured the signing of Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund, the hope was that they had finally addressed a problem position that had troubled the club for a decade.¬† Not since Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs first stint at Old Trafford have they had a player who could dominate the attack down the right wing and the England international was viewed as the solution to their problems.¬† It is ironic that the 21-year-old has found good form down the opposite flank.¬† Sancho‚Äôs start was so slow that it even led to reports that the club were trying to offload him in January.  That was never the case and his upturn in form in the last few weeks could not have come at a better time with the rest of the front-line now stuttering.¬† He has scored two goals in the last three games ‚Äì as many as he managed in his previous 23 ‚Äì and he has started delivering the sparkling performances which saw him light up the Bundesliga with Dortmund.  Over the last three games, Sancho has looked like a totally different player.¬† Club staff were keen to avoid piling pressure on the ex-Manchester City youth when he arrived and there was a feeling that the expectancy that comes with being a ¬£73m ($101m) transfer at a club the size of Man Utd was impacting the winger.¬† Illness delayed his pre-season and, while he was left playing catch-up to get fully fit to the standards expected, he struggled for game time, starting just three of the first 10 league games.  The pressure of his big-money move got to Sancho and the club have worked with him to build up his confidence and belief.¬† Ralf Rangnick and the United coaching staff have had individual chats with the forward in which they have encouraged him to be confident and take on opponents.  We are starting to see the results.¬† His average number of shots per game has increased from 1.4 to 2.3 in the last three games compared to his first 23 appearances, which means he is averaging a shot every 35 minutes compared to every 78.  He is now also averaging a shot on target per game compared to one every 2.7 games previously.¬† Sancho‚Äôs passing accuracy has also jumped from 84.8 percent to 88.5% but, most importantly, he is playing with a directness and a swagger which shows his confidence is starting to return.¬† ‚ÄúThis is also a normal reaction for the player if he realises he is getting better, that he is scoring goals, that he is giving assists of course this helps to raise his confidence,‚Äù Rangnick said ahead of United's Premier League clash against Brighton on Tuesday.¬† There is clearly still room for further improvement. Clips showing the England international failing to track back have led to him being criticised but he is not on his own in that aspect.  The team‚Äôs lack of pressing without the ball was pointed out by opposition manager Ralph Hasenhuttl on Saturday.¬† ¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big secret that when they lose the ball, the reverse gears are not the best from everyone,‚Äù the Southampton manager said. ¬† With the forwards fluffing their lines and averaging just 1.4 goals per game under Rangnick, the German manager will no doubt excuse Sancho of some of his defensive duties if he can get the rest of his strikeforce firing.¬† One of the issues which comes with Sancho finding form down the left is that the right side of the attack is still a problem.  Marcus Rashford does not look as confident over there and even when the pair switch during games, it is clear they both prefer the left.¬† ‚ÄúI think he is one of the players who now benefits from our style of football, playing from the left side is also something that suits him,‚Äù Rangnick said.  ‚ÄúI remember the first season of Robert Lewandowski at Dortmund he was not regularly playing and only in the second year he had the breakthrough.  ""I‚Äôm pretty positive that Jadon is on the right pathway, now that he realises he can be successful and one of the best wingers in the Premier League, not only the German Bundesliga.¬† ‚ÄúThe only thing I and my coaching staff did was show belief in him and with a few other younger players ‚Äì Marcus Rashford, Anthony Elanga are two other examples and this is the only way we can develop young players at a club like Manchester United.‚Äù Those in the background have always been confident Sancho would find his feet in the Premier League.  It has taken longer than some were expecting but with United struggling for goals and points, it has been one of the few positives in a bleak few weeks for the club.¬† The hope is now that he can take his newfound confidence to push himself, and the team, to the next level.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/a-change-of-position-and-chats-with-rangnick-how-sancho/bltcc0a42053acbcd83,Charlotte Duncker,33f6fe73-20a1-4945-b9d9-07a444d3a877

How can broke Barcelona afford to sign ‚Ç¨55m Ferran Torres from Man City?,"Barcelona have all but sealed the signing of Manchester City forward Ferran Torres for ‚Ç¨55 million (¬£47m/$62m), despite having a ‚Ç¨1bn (¬£849m/$1.1bn) hole in their finances. The Catalans remain mired in debt, leading many to wonder how they can afford to bring in a top-class attacking reinforcement in January. The deal makes great sense to the parties concerned. Xavi wants quality in the final third; Barca are desperate for a player that can add goals and help them finish in the top four.¬† Torres, who left Valencia in the summer of 2020, has not nailed down a regular starting spot at City and jumped at the chance to return to Spain, especially for a club of Barcelona‚Äôs size, despite their recent piled-up humiliations.¬† City, for their part, have plenty of backup, with Raheem Sterling back in form after flirting with the exit, among various other forwards jostling for a spot in the side. They also signed Torres for ‚Ç¨23m (¬£20m/$26m), so are making nearly triple their money back if he succeeds at Camp Nou, and the cost of the deal rises to ‚Ç¨65m (¬£55m/$74m) once add-ons are taken into account. Regardless of all those concerned being satisfied with the arrangement, the numbers have to add up for it to actually happen. The up-front funding for the deal with City is not a problem, because Barcelona were recently loaned half a billion euros by investment bank Goldman Sachs. However, the issues lie with La Liga‚Äôs own financial fair play rules and spending limit, which they are far exceeding. Just as Barca had to wait until the last minutes of the summer window to register Sergio Aguero, thanks to Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets taking pay-cuts, Torres will not be immediately able to play without further action to lower club costs.¬† Aguero‚Äôs recent retirement and decision to sacrifice the second year of his contract with Barcelona has eked out some room, with the Blaugrana able to spend what they save only on a 1:4 ratio because they are over La Liga‚Äôs spending cap.  For example, if Barcelona make ‚Ç¨100m (¬£85m/$113m) of savings, they are permitted to spend ‚Ç¨25m (¬£21m/$28m) on transfer fees and wages for new players. Sporting director Mateu Alemany will have negotiated a low salary with Torres for the first six months of his contract, rising through the length of his deal, to help with minimising this season‚Äôs costs. The transfer fee will be amortised over the length of his contract, which is also the key to another part of the club‚Äôs plan. Barca‚Äôs most pressing issue is to sign Ousmane Dembele to a new contract, with the France striker‚Äôs deal up in the summer. Not just so they do not lose him for free, but so the remaining portion of his transfer fee can be paid over the remaining years of his deal, instead of just this campaign.  That would create further breathing room and help set the ball rolling for getting the Torres registration through. Dembele may also be asked to shift around his salary payment structure to let the club bring Torres in. It is in the interests of everyone at the club that more help arrives in attack, as it will aid Barcelona‚Äôs challenge for a top-four spot and Champions League football next season.  Sergi Roberto is another player with an expiring contract who might negotiate a new deal that minimises what he is owed in the short term.¬† Most importantly of all, the club will need to offload unwanted players. In recent weeks Philippe Coutinho has been left on the bench and seen players like Riqui Puig and Ferran Jutgla come on or start ahead of him.  It is a message from Xavi. The Brazilian‚Äôs time is up, and if Barcelona could sell him, or even loan him to get his wages off the books for this season, it would be a huge help. Similarly, Samuel Umtiti is another player who is not required, with Xavi having started him against Osasuna in his first appearance of the season to put him in the shop window. Reserve goalkeeper Neto is another who could depart, with the club happy to utilise La Masia graduates Inaki Pena or Arnau Tenas in his place on the bench. Other clubs will also see a potential opportunity to strike for some of the club‚Äôs stars, including Frenkie de Jong and Sergino Dest, although president Joan Laporta will be loathe¬†to let any of the club's teenage starlets like Ansu Fati, Gavi, Pedri and Nico Gonzalez depart.  As well as the team‚Äôs dependence on them, they also carry the fans‚Äô hopes. The Torres deal will boost morale there too. While some will view the operation as an extravagance for a club that cannot afford it, it is also a sign that Barcelona are not dead - something potential sponsors and investors will approve and value.¬† Atletico Madrid‚Äôs defeat by Granada on Wednesday leaves Barca just two points off Champions League qualification, despite their dismal start to the campaign. It means immediate investment in this targeted area might now help secure the club‚Äôs medium-term financial health.¬† Missing out on the top four is not something Barcelona‚Äôs tattered account books can bear, particularly after their stumble into the Europa League, and Torres can help stave off another crisis.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-can-barcelona-afford-55m-ferran-torres-man-city/blt89cda10ba21c7143,Rik Sharma,ce62b88a-447b-488c-99ca-d257f11c5df0
Jesus leads exciting Arsenal to 4-2 win over Leicester as Gunners keep up hot Premier League start,"WHAT HAPPENED? Gabriel Jesus impressed as he struck twice amid a rampant display from the home side, who conceded twice in the second half but responded almost immediately both times. Granit Xhaka and Gabriel Martinelli got in on the goals to help put the game to bed. THE BIGGER PICTURE: That makes it two wins from two in the Premier League for Mikel Arteta's men, who started the campaign with a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace. Leicester, meanwhile, have just one point after drawing with Brentford last week. ALL EYES ON: Jesus was pivotal in the victory. He looped a shot over the goalkeeper for his first Premier League goal at Arsenal, then he was perfectly placed to head in his second. He also chipped in with two assists, teeing up Xhaka and Martinelli. THE MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW?

Arsenal's Nketiah to snub Premier League transfer & sign contract extension with Gunners,"Eddie Nketiah is close to signing a new contract with Arsenal. The Gunners striker had looked set to leave on a free transfer this summer, with his current deal due to expire at the end of June. He had rejected previous offers to extend his stay, but Arsenal are growing hopeful that the 22-year-old has had a change of heart and is now ready to commit. Nketiah has turned down multiple chances to sign a new contract during the past 12 months, with the forward pointing to his lack of regular game time. Arsenal had been resigned to losing him on a free transfer this summer amid interest from several clubs, including Crystal Palace - who saw a bid rejected for the frontman in January. But, having enjoyed a fine end to the season after scoring five goals from eight successive starts in the Premier League, there is a growing belief around the club that Nketiah will now commit to fresh terms. Talks are believed to be progressing quickly and clubs who had been chasing Nketiah now sense he will be staying in north London. The development comes soon after Arsenal announced that Mohamed Elneny had extended his contract, which was also due to expire this summer. Arsenal‚Äôs manager has always been hopeful Nketiah would remain at Emirates Stadium and has admitted that the striker has proved him wrong with his recent performances. ‚ÄúIf there is one player that I have been unfair with I think it‚Äôs him,‚Äù Arteta said last month.¬† ‚ÄúHe has given me every right to do something different, and if Eddie doesn‚Äôt play more, it‚Äôs my fault and because I missed something or I haven‚Äôt had the courage to play him more.¬† ‚ÄúHe has shown me more how wrong I was.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-nketiah-premier-league-transfer-sign-contract/blt3d2c60a29ad899de,Charles Watts,90a4976e-3abf-4e8c-b6f1-f4ed0fe8fedf
Erik ten Hag makes Manchester United transfer pledge & addresses Rashford exit talk,"Erik ten Hag is convinced Manchester United will secure his transfer targets before the close of the window. The Dutchman insists it is imperative his squad is improved to have any hope of his first season ending in success. The United manager is desperate to strengthen in midfield and attack - but has already missed out on leading strike targets Darwin Nunez and Benjamin Sesko, while the pursuit of Frenkie de Jong is in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Ten Hag is adamant Marcus Rashford will not be sold to Paris Saint-Germain, despite the French giants expressing interest in the forward. United are closing in on the signing of Adrien Rabiot from Juventus, with a fee of ¬£15 million ($18m) being agreed for the France international midfielder. It is now a case of thrashing out personal terms, with football director, John Murtough, flying out to Italy to try and conclude the deal. United abandoned a controversial move for Marko Arnautovic this week, following a furious backlash from fans, but still refuse to meet Ajax's valuation of Antony. Cody Gakpo, from PSV Eindhoven, is seen as a cheaper alternative at around ¬£35m ($42m). Ten Hag is still desperate to complete the signing of De Jong - but now faces competition from Chelsea for the Netherlands midfielder, whose preference is to stay at Barcelona. Asked if he was confident United would have a better squad by the time of the window closing on September 1, Ten Hag said: ""We have to. I am convinced we will have. ""I'm happy. I think we're co-operating really well, I cannot talk about any names. I cannot talk about players under contract at other clubs."" Asked if he was on the same page as the club in terms of what he wants, he said, simply: ""Yes.""

Man Utd's Jones: I'm still good enough to play at the highest level,"Phil Jones believes that he is still good enough to continue to play at the highest level, as the Manchester United defender eyes a return to regular football following several years sat on the sidelines. The former England defender made his long-awaited return to first-team action earlier this season, ending a 712-day absence after a debilitating run of injuries kept him out of consistent action. Yet his chances have still been limited since his first game back in January, and a reported loan move to Bordeaux collapsed - but the 30-year-old says that he feels fortunate enough to have had the career he has had, and that he still thinks he can offer more over the coming years. ""I feel lucky,"" Jones told The Guardian. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100% lucky to have played in two World Cups, been through the Euros and had some fantastic moments at Old Trafford with some amazing players. ""Of course people say: ‚ÄòYou should have done this, you could have done that, blah blah blah.‚Äô But I feel so lucky.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still only 30 and I‚Äôve missed a lot of football. I‚Äôm hoping to recapture some form and enjoy playing football. When I was out injured it was a difficult time but I‚Äôll never give up. I feel like I‚Äôm still good enough and I‚Äôve got a lot to give. So I‚Äôm hopeful. I‚Äôm ready to play again.‚Äù One of a handful of players among the current Manchester United crop to actually win the Premier League, alongside stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and David De Gea, Jones has often found himself battling against a less-than-stellar reputation on the field. But his admirers remain many, and even if he has to bring the curtain down on his stay at Manchester United, he is unlikely to be short of potential suitors who would consider his experience crucial. ""Let‚Äôs see what happens,"" he added. ""I‚Äôm hoping I can get some game time and I‚Äôm giving everything in training every day.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-jones-im-still-good-enough-play-at-highest-level/blt912c69a0b121823a,Andrew Steel,25c64a09-095a-4b5b-a1bc-b829124efcf6

Champions League: Mahrez leads Manchester City‚Äôs attack against Hazard-less Real Madrid,"Manchester City have named their starting XI for Wednesday‚Äôs Champions League semi-final second-leg match against Real Madrid, with Riyad Mahrez handed a starter‚Äôs role. The Algeria international played the entire match and supplied an assist as the Citizens recorded a hard-fought 4-3 triumph in the first-leg clash played at the Etihad Stadium. That was Mahrez‚Äôs 11th game in the competition this season with six goals to his credit for Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side. This time, manager Guardiola has started the former Leicester City star and he is expected to start in the attack alongside Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. Meanwhile, France international of Senegalese descent Ferland Mendy will start in the Los Blancos‚Äô backline that boasts of Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao and Nacho, with French star of Angolan background Eduardo Camavinga among the named substitutes. Mahrez was tagged as ‚Äòstingy and wasteful' by GOAL fans after missing a golden chance in the first leg against Carlos Ancelotti's side. City could have stretched their lead to 3-0, but the Algerian, after being set up following a counter-attack; chose to go for goal himself rather than squaring for a tap in, with Kevin De Bruyne and Foden to his left for support. In a recent interview, retired full-back Micah Richards felt the 31-year-old would have as many goals as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah if he kept things simple in front of goal. ""I don't find Mahrez frustrating because I feel he lacks quality, I just think he's got even more to offer,"" the former England international wrote in a column for BBC Sport. ""He will do something ridiculous like bring the ball down with an immaculate first touch, go past three players‚Ä¶ and then waste it all by trying to do too much in front of goal, and the opportunity is gone. ""If Mahrez did the simple things in those areas, he would have Mohamed Salah's stats and be scoring 40 goals a season."" The winners of this cracker on aggregate will face Premier League side, Liverpool, in the final billed for the Stade de France, Saint-Denis on May 28.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-mahrez-leads-manchester-city-s-attack/bltac3680bbf2545008,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,cfa25ecc-5fe0-469e-853f-b2e713c5b949
When will Zlatan Ibrahimovic retire & how much longer can he play?,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic burst onto the senior stage at Malmo as a teen in 1999 and, 22 years into a new millennium, the enigmatic Swede is still going strong at 40 years of age. Trophies have been collected by a modern day great on a regular basis over the course of a stunning career that has seen him spend time with the likes of Juventus, Inter, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and AC Milan. There will come a day when he has to head into retirement, but when will his boots by hung up and for how much longer could he continue playing at the top level? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ The self-proclaimed ‚ÄòGod‚Äô of football has never shied away from the fact that he intends to prolong his career for as long as possible. With a competitive fire burning as bright as ever within an evergreen frontman, there is no need for him to consider walking away from a profession that has made him a living legend. Zlatan at 40.So many iconic moments üòé pic.twitter.com/yRaFJlFOVV Ibrahimovic has collected league titles in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France, while also claiming domestic cup honours in many of his various landing spots ‚Äì including in England when at Old Trafford. He has registered over 500 goals at club level, with time also spent in the United States with the LA Galaxy, while the target has been found on a record-setting 62 occasions while earning 121 caps for his country. As he has been showing no sign of slowing down, netting 36 times for Milan since rejoining them in December 2019, no fixed date has been set for his retirement. Niggling injuries have started to become more frequent, with knee problems holding him back in 2021-22, and Rossoneri boss Stefano Pioli has said of Ibrahimovic‚Äôs future plans as he works on rolling 12-month contracts at San Siro: ""Everyone can have physical problems, he is dealing with a knee issue now. We hope he can return before the end of the season. ""As for his future, I don‚Äôt think something has changed. I am sure he will make the best choice, and we‚Äôll back him regardless of what he decides."" Unsurprisingly, Ibrahimovic has responded to suggestions that he may be considering retirement in typically bold fashion, with the Swede posting a video on social media that shows he has lost none of his touch. He said: ""I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you."" I decide when to stop, just like I decide that the yellow ball will hit you pic.twitter.com/481mnOGG2W Having made over 850 appearances on the domestic stage and well over 100 in the international arena, Ibrahimovic could be forgiven for allowing his attention to drift towards what may come next for him. He is, however, someone who has perfected the art of keeping focus locked on the present, and he is not about to change his ways. The veteran forward has admitted that the thought of having to stop playing football does scare him. He has said: ""I do feel a slight sense of panic at the prospect of retirement. ""I will certainly keep playing for as long as possible, as long as I can get results and am not suffering. I want to end my career without regrets, so I have to maximise my time. ""I know the adrenaline I feel at the moment will never be the same. We are programmed to wake up, go to training, return home and rest.

He has said: ""I won‚Äôt quit until I have won something with this Milan side."" Ibrahimovic has also stated that ""the reality is I‚Äôll play until I see that someone is better than me, so I‚Äôm still playing."" He has gone on to say: ""Normally, at 40, you're at home, you light up a cigar and you're satisfied with the career you've had. I‚Äôm not ready to smoke a cigar yet."" The world has been warned, Ibrahimovic is going nowhere any time soon and will only walk away on his own terms when there is nothing left for him to achieve. As mentioned, Ibrahimovic has collected trophies and medals just about everywhere he has been - including many individual ones such as Golden Boots and Player of the Year prizes - with his mere presence helping to raise collective standards within any squad he graces.

How Emery recovered from his Arsenal nightmare to lift Villarreal back to Europe‚Äôs top table,"Unai Emery left France and England bruised by his time at Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal, respectively, but has found his footing again in his native Spain, lifting Villarreal to new heights. The coach exacted revenge on the Gunners last season by knocking them out of the Europa League before beating Manchester United in the final to lift Villarreal‚Äôs first major trophy, and his goals are loftier now.  After crushing Juventus 3-0 in Turin, Villarreal have been pitted against German giants Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals. Emery has never made it to this stage of the tournament before, although nobody boasts a better Europa League record than him, with three wins at Sevilla adding to last season‚Äôs success with the Yellow Submarine. His PSG team should have beaten Barcelona in 2017, after a 4-0 last 16 first-leg triumph, but the Catalans‚Äô momentous 6-1 ‚Äòremontada‚Äô put paid to Emery‚Äôs hopes. Despite the many pitfalls and the ""good ebening"" mockery he suffered in England, the headstrong, borderline obsessive coach did not give up and now his work is bearing fruit.  In England, where he was considered a failure, he is starting to get some of the respect he deserves. ‚ÄúSometimes it just doesn‚Äôt fit between a manager and a certain football club but that doesn‚Äôt make him a bad manager,‚Äù said Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport.  ‚ÄúThe history he‚Äôs got as a coach and what he‚Äôs doing with this team now and beating Man Utd in the final last season ‚Äì this guy is a top-level manager.‚Äù His colleague and former Chelsea playmaker Joe Cole agreed.  ‚ÄúEmery was the right manager at the wrong time,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúEverything he did, he was getting criticised for. I think they missed a trick with that one.‚Äù Emery made mistakes in England and he was unable to communicate effectively with his players, who perhaps were also influenced by outside views of him and not willing to fully engage with his plans. Maybe the chaos of the Premier League didn‚Äôt suit a manager so tactically driven, who wants his players to go above and beyond, and for that to truly happen, needs to be able to communicate to them both how and why. Not just the players, either, but the fans too. They turned on him after the Europa League final defeat by Chelsea in Baku and subsequent failure to reach the Champions League. ‚ÄúThe club was happy with me, but the fans were calling for a change, and it had to happen,‚Äù Emery told The Athletic this week. As Cole said, Emery came at the wrong time. Following Arsene Wenger, who led the team from October 1996 to May 2018, in over 1,200 matches, proved an impossible job. Mikel Arteta is succeeding now, to some extent, but is taking time which Emery was not granted. And the expectations at Arsenal, given their history, are huge. By contrast, Villarreal are a club that wants trophies on the board and believe Emery is a man who can carry them to Spain‚Äôs east coast.  Crucially, he has the players on his side, where at Arsenal there was trouble with Granit Xhaka, Mesut Ozil and others. ‚ÄúOne day one of the captains, Raul Albiol, said ‚ÄòCoach, you've won the Europa League, we want you to take us on that road,‚Äô‚Äù Emery told UEFA this week.  Villarreal, then, were all-in for Emery, which with his methodology, is crucial. The coach notoriously scrutinises every detail and needs his players to be hungry sponges, ready to soak in whatever information Emery or his team draw up on their opponents. He is a pragmatist, from the Diego Simeone playbook, recognising when his team may be weaker than their opponent and working very hard on fixing potential deficits. ‚ÄúThe first thing to do is a lot of analysis, so the players know everything possible about who they are facing,‚Äù Emery told UEFA.  ‚ÄúI try to give them more work rather than less, more information, tell them everything we can, and then we can be optimistic, as long as it‚Äôs based on all the work that we have done. "" Why not? We can beat teams that are better than us. The only way to do it is to go game by game, enjoying the work and not thinking about the final. Not thinking that we are going to win.  ""‚ÄòMentalising‚Äô in each game, how we can be better and find the solutions to the problems that our opponents pose us.‚Äù That is just what Villarreal did against Juventus, after a 1-1 draw at home they travelled to Italy, found the cracks in the Old Lady‚Äôs system and brutally exploited them to progress 4-1 on aggregate. The team was less efficient at the weekend against Levante, falling to a 2-0 defeat in the derby, perhaps momentarily taking their eye off the ball ahead of the Bayern clash ‚Äì not unlike Chelsea, who lost 4-1 to Brentford, or Real Madrid, who needed three penalties to scrape past Celta Vigo 2-1. ‚ÄúThe Bayern game will be very different,‚Äù said Emery. ‚ÄúAgainst Levante, we were close to their box and we lacked the accuracy to change the game.  ""Now, we have to focus on Wednesday‚Äôs match. For better or worse, we are showing a different level of performance in the two competitions.‚Äù  The defeat was a disappointing way for Emery to chalk up his 100th game in charge of Villarreal, although it was only his 23rd at the helm, with 49 wins and 28 draws on the bench. There was a chance he didn‚Äôt make it this far, when Newcastle United tried to tempt him in November, giving him an opportunity to right the wrongs of his first spell in England, to build from scratch on Tyneside instead of having to strip away parts of Wenger‚Äôs Arsenal dynasty first. However, Emery realised just how precious what he had at Villarreal was, which was Champions League football and a club that believes in him. The key ingredient he needs for success.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/emery-recovered-arsenal-nightmare-lift-villarreal-europe-top/bltad78f082e9d63289,Rik Sharma,4e6da643-46f5-400a-ae8b-93e1c7b56600
Gundogan endorses Haaland to Man City and says Dortmund striker can work with Guardiola,"Ilkay Gundogan believes Erling Haaland would be a success at Manchester City but warned the Premier League champions rarely play with a striker. Man City are the main candidates to sign Haaland from Borussia Dortmund, but Real Madrid and Barcelona are still in contention. Gundogan is confident the 21-year-old would work well with coach Pep Guardiola, even though they usually do not play with an attacker of his style. Gundogan said: ""Haaland has the quality for every top-team.‚Äú However the Germany international pointed out that City tend to use a false nine, adding: ""It feels like an eternity since we played with a striker."" City tend to play with a three-man attack, however Guardiola has used a midfielder in the centre of the front three. Lately, Phil Foden has been the man to fill the position, but Jack Grealish and winger Bernardo Silva have also been trusted to take on the role this season. Haaland, meanwhile, is an out-and-out striker for Borussia Dortmund and Norway. The forward has scored 23 times in as many appearances in all competitions this season, leading to interest from Europe's top teams.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gundogan-haaland-man-city-dortmund-guardiola/blt49651b656deafcaf,By Peter McVitie,ef1b413c-04ab-4c40-a8ef-d7e484ff33d7
"One goal, no wins: What now for Arsenal after January from hell?","Five games, three defeats, two draws, and no wins. Arsenal fans around the world breathed a huge sigh of relief when November - usually the Gunners‚Äô hoodoo month - passed by without any real damage. It turns out, however, that their suffering was only on hold for the opening month of 2022. Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side kicked off January full of hope after a thrilling end to December saw them win five games in a row in all competitions, scoring 19 goals in the process. But from the moment Granit Xhaka tripped Bernardo Silva to give away the penalty that sparked Manchester City‚Äôs comeback victory on New Year‚Äôs Day, things have started to go wrong. They were shocked by Championship side Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Liverpool at the semi-final stage following a 2-0 defeat in the second leg on Thursday night. That defeat put extra emphasis on Sunday‚Äôs game against bottom of the table Burnley, their first Premier League fixture since the defeat by leaders Man City at the start of the month. But despite dominating against the Clarets, they could not find a way through as they toiled to a goalless draw. They had their chances, but an open-goal miss from Alexandre Lacazette following some superb approach play from Emile Smith Rowe summed up how things have gone for the Gunners in January. The effort has been there, but in front of goal they have been found lacking. Bukayo Saka‚Äôs strike that put them in front against City on New Year‚Äôs Day is the only goal Arsenal have scored in their five games this month. They have gone four consecutive games without finding the net since then. It is the first time that has happened since December 2005. ""We have to find a way to win those games if you want to be fighting with the top teams,"" Arteta said after Sunday‚Äôs stalemate. ""We didn't start the game well enough, but we came out in the second half and were more incisive, we penetrated much more and the speed of the ball was better. ‚ÄúBut in the end we didn't show enough quality in the box to win the match.‚Äù There are, of course, mitigating circumstances for Arsenal‚Äôs miserable January. The squad has been decimated by injuries and Covid-19, while key players have been away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. But that cannot be used as an excuse, because they have also shot themselves in the foot at times. They have picked up three red cards in five games, with the dismissal of Xhaka against Liverpool at Anfield proving especially costly in the absence of Thomas Partey. Partey himself returned after Ghana were knocked out of AFCON early, only to also get sent off in the closing stages in the return leg against Liverpool on Thursday, meaning both he and Xhaka were unavailable against Burnley. The lack of midfield options has been clear, with Arteta having to switch formations to a 4-3-3 in recent games to cover for his absentees. It was a change done out of necessity, with Sambi Lokonga the only recognised midfielder left, but it just has not worked. And it must be remembered that had Arsenal not allowed Ainsley Maitland-Niles to join Roma at the start of the month, he would have been a huge asset to Arteta in recent weeks. In fact, had he still been around, Maitland-Niles would probably have started each of Arsenal‚Äôs last four games - such has been the extent of their recent midfield crisis. Letting the 24-year-old leave so early in the month without bringing in a replacement looked an odd decision at the time. Now it looks a truly baffling one. ‚ÄúIt's what we planned, but the market is difficult, it's complicated,‚Äù Arteta said on Sunday, when asked if he expected to have some new signings on board by now. ‚ÄúWe are certainly trying, but I don't know if we're going to be able to do it [before deadline day].¬† ‚ÄúPlayers that come here have to be able to take us to the next level. We already have a level, and we want to see much better standards than we already have, and that is how we're going to recruit.‚Äù The need to strengthen the squad in central midfield and up front has been obvious since the start of month, but so far Arsenal have been unable to secure any of their targets. The fact that they ended the game against Burnley with Rob Holding playing as the central striker said it all. January is, of course, a very difficult month to do business, especially when it comes to signing a top-quality striker. But if Arteta is not planning to bring Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang back into the fold, then you feel it is crucial the Gunners manage to do something before the transfer window closes on January 31 to give them that extra bit of quality in the final third. Because for all their struggles since the turn of the year, they are still bang in the running for a top-four spot.¬† They just need to take their chances when they arrive, something they were unable to do against Burnley or against Liverpool in the semi-final earlier in the week. ‚ÄúTo win you need to have a different level of quality, and we lacked that,‚Äù Arteta admitted. ‚ÄúWith the amount of situations we generated, you need a spark. Someone has to win you the game if you want to be on top.‚Äù The key thing now for Arsenal is to ensure they are ready to hit the ground running when they return from this international break. As disappointing as the past month has been, Arteta‚Äôs side still has everything to play for in the league between now and the end of the season. Players will be back from injury, suspension and AFCON when they are in action next, at Wolves on February 10, while you would hope at least one new signing will have also been added. So the squad will be looking far stronger and you would expect the performances that follow to be more akin to December than what we have seen in January. If they are not, then it will not be long before Arsenal‚Äôs top-four ambitions go the same as their dreams of ending the season with silverware.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/one-goal-no-wins-arsenal-january-from-hell/blt9a033480afb66d1b,Charles Watts,00e73da4-3247-4c75-8fc2-f12db9fa1943
Pique 'cried when Messi left Barcelona' but understands why 'best player in the history of the game' joined PSG,"Gerard Pique admits he ‚Äúcried when Lionel Messi left Barcelona‚Äù, but one long-serving star can appreciate why another had to depart for Paris Saint-Germain. The seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner swapped life in Catalunya for the French capital during the summer of 2021 once it became apparent the Liga giants could not afford to offer him a new contract. Tears flowed when the mercurial South American bid farewell to Barca, with fellow La Masia academy graduate Pique among those overcome by emotion as ‚Äúthe best player in the history of the game‚Äù severed his career-long ties with the Blaugrana. Pique was a close friend of the Argentine superstar, who broke countless records during a memorable spell at Camp Nou. Hetold Gary Neville on The Overlap of seeing an all-time great move on: ‚ÄúI cried when Messi left Barcelona. I cried for him. For the career he had at Barca, it would have been great if he had stayed until the end of his career at the club. ‚ÄúI can understand why Messi couldn‚Äôt renew. The club was suffering a lot economically because of the past president and how he managed the club. ""At the end of the day, these are things that happen in life. Sometimes you make a decision and things don‚Äôt work out. ‚ÄúFor Barcelona and the fans Messi was like a God, it would have been great if he stayed.‚Äù Messi in tears at his farewell press conference üò≠ pic.twitter.com/svTtdcmZDr Pique added: ‚ÄúLionel Messi is the best player in the history of the game.‚Äù ‚ÄúMessi was Barcelona‚Äôs best player. I‚Äôve always said that we had Messi to win titles, but we also had to have a good team. A single player cannot win titles.‚Äù Pique has also lavished praise on former Barca boss Pep Guardiola ‚Äì who delivered three Liga titles and two Champions League crowns across four years as manager at Camp Nou. Pique said of the coach now chasing major honours at Manchester City: ‚ÄúHe is very clever and he understands the game as no-one I‚Äôve seen before. He gives you all the tools to go to the game and be ready for any kind of situation. ‚ÄúHe studies very well the other team and from that he starts to tell you, you have to do this in this situation, you have to do that.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom that you feel very confident you will be ready for the game, no matter the challenge, no matter how difficult the striker you have to mark, the centre-back you have to face. And this is all because of him, mentally he‚Äôs very good, his speeches are very good. ‚ÄúHe touches your heart.

"Chelsea's winners, losers and ratings as Koulibaly & James shine amid carnage on the touchline","Are you not entertained?! The first Battle of the Bridge between Chelsea and Tottenham was over six years ago now, but these two teams still do not like one another, and that was clear again on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte almost came to blows on the touchline as their teams played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in west London. Kalidou Koulibaly gave Chelsea the lead with a stunning first-half volley, but Spurs fought back after the break and equalised through Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. That sparked the first touchline row, and Tuchel was soon tearing off down the touchline to rub it in Conte's face when Reece James gave Chelsea the lead again. But Spurs had the final say as Harry Kane headed in a stoppage-time equaliser, before more arguments at full-time left to both managers being red-carded.

"'Warrior' Casemiro has already got Man Utd winning, claims Varane","WHAT HAPPENED? Casemiro completed his ¬£70-million move from Real Madrid on Monday and was paraded in front of the fans at Old Trafford before Erik ten Hag's side produced their best performance of the season to pile further misery on winless Liverpool.  WHAT THEY SAID: Varane, who won four Champions Leagues alongside Casemiro at Madrid, said: ""I know perfectly his quality. He can bring this balance to the team and his mentality. ‚ÄúHe's a warrior, so I think he will really enjoy the English football. It was a perfect night for him to meet Old Trafford because the atmosphere was absolutely amazing, and he brings us a victory, so it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù  THE BIGGER PICTURE: Ten Hag has been desperate to sign a world-class holding midfielder, having spent the summer chasing Frenkie de Jong. He described Casemiro as a winner, who will be the ""cement"" in United's midfield, and his signing, as well as the victory, will massively lift the mood at the club. IN THREE PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR UNITED? Ten Hag has not finished his business yet. He wants to bring in another forward and would ideally like to further strengthen in midfield and a right back.

USMNT's Aaronson pledges international focus amid $27m Leeds transfer link,"Brenden Aaronson insists he's fully focused on his upcoming games with the U.S. men's national team despite recent transfer links to Leeds. Reports have linked the American star with a move to the Premier League amid another breakout season for the midfielder, who has become a key contributor for both the USMNT and his club, RB Salzburg. But Aaronson refused to discuss transfer rumors as he prepares for a trio of vital World Cup qualifiers with the U.S. in the coming days. When asked about the reports linking him with Leeds, Aaronson replied that he is not yet willing to discuss anything involving his transfer status. But the 21-year-old midfielder went on to say that it's not hard for him to look past those rumors linking him with what would be a career-altering move to the Premier League. ""It's not really hard for me because I'm focused on what's at hand,"" he said. ""I'm focused on these World Cup qualifying games and that's all my thought process is on.  ""That's something that's away from it and I'm really just not worried about it. I'm just worried about getting these wins with America."" A move to the Premier League would be massive for Aaronson, with reports saying the transfer fee for the midfielder could reach up to ¬£20 million ($27m). But, as things stand, RB Salzburg are reportedly unwilling to sell as the club looks ahead towards their Champions League round of 16 clash with Bayern Munich next month. Aaronson joined Salzburg from the Philadelphia Union in 2020 and has made 46 appearances for the club, scoring 10 goals. He's also become a regular for the USMNT and was arguably the team's best player in 2021 as he scored four of his five career international goals last year with two coming in World Cup qualifiers. In total, Aaronson has earned 15 caps for the U.S. and is expected to be a major part of the team's plans for upcoming matches against El Salvador, Canada and Honduras.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-aaronson-leeds-transfer-link/bltbce24ddb5d2ac015,Ryan Tolmich,77fb5a55-c9db-46b9-9bd8-5961c0754af0

Will Afcon 2021 be cancelled? Why international tournament is in danger,"The Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) is one of international football's major continental tournaments. The latest edition of the 24-team event is due to get under way in January 2022, with Algeria set to defend the trophy that they won in 2019. However, fresh doubts have been raised over whether the latest edition of AFCON will go ahead. So will AFCON 2021 be cancelled and why is the competition in danger of delay? GOAL brings you everything we know so far. There has not yet been any formal announcement regarding the possible cancellation of the tournament. However, AFCON organisers could be forced into altering their plans due to safety and logistical concerns. RMC Sport report that there is ""uncertainty"" surrounding the tournament and that the CAF could cancel the event. Talk of a cancellation has been dismissed by CAF's director of communications Alex Siewe, who told the BBC: ""We can't keep spending time dealing with rumours."" In addition, a spokesman for Cameroon's ministry of sports told Filgoal: ""The minister of sports met Samuel Eto'o and affirmed that the country is ready to host the tournament and refute all those reports that we can't host it. ""We will tell the CAN that we refuse the hypothesis of postponement if they ask us, we have a great will to host the tournament on time."" It has been reported that AFCON is in danger of being called off due to the rise in Omicron Covid-19 variant cases. The tournament was already pushed back from its original summer start date due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and it has been suggested that another postponement - or cancellation - is now imminent. Around 40 players from the Premier League are slated to appear in the African competition, and concerns have been raised over how much of an impact there will be on the club season, if they take part in the tournament. The European Club Association (ECA) has released a letter to FIFA threatening to withhold players from the tournament if a suitable plan for medical and operational protocol is not presented. The ECA, which represents leading clubs across Europe, has implored AFCON to respect the five-day quarantine rule that FIFA has imposed on players returning from international duty. ""With regards to applicable protocols, as far as we are aware, CAF (the Confederation of African football) has not yet made available a suitable medical and operational protocol for the AFCON tournament, in the absence of which clubs will not be able to release players for the tournament,"" the ECA told FIFA in a letter obtained by AFP. The spokesman for Cameroon's ministry of sport added: ""It's a plot against us and [ECA's] statement contains wrong information. They say Covid is widespread in Cameroon - what about the UK that recorded till now 10 million and more infections and have more than 147,000 deaths, while we only recorded less than 110,000 infections and less than 1500 deaths. ""We play the league here normally, we are ready to host the tournament on time and the CAF committee have seen this in their last visit and where overwhelmed.""

The Cameroon FA have confirmed that the 2021 AFCON will take place between January 9 and February 6 üèÜNot ideal for clubs with African players üëÄ pic.twitter.com/FChtgLfIyp The host nation will take on Burkina Faso in the opening game in Yaounde, with the action then scheduled to run all the way through to the final in the capital city on February 6. It is not yet known when AFCON could be rescheduled for, if it is postponed again. With the 2022 World Cup not taking place until November in Qatar, there is potentially a gap for AFCON in summer 2022, but the possibility of player burnout would also have to be taken into consideration after the conclusion of the club season. There have previously been fears that Cameroon would be stripped of hosting duties after problems with their preparations. Former technical director of the Confederation of African Football, Abdel Moneim Shatta, even suggested the event could be moved to Qatar at the start of December. CAF general secretary Veron Mosengo-Omba¬†has since joined the team in Cameroon to ensure that everything is in place for January 9, but the latest surge in Omicron cases could once again lead to a rethink.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/will-afcon-2021-cancelled-why/bltbc543f623b11a609,James Westwood,bdbbde93-e897-44d9-9a8e-2b13b484a522
Watch: Dembele scores two stunning solo goals for Barcelona in thrilling 2-2 draw with Juventus,"Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele put on a show in Dallas with two breathtaking first-half goals against Juventus on Wednesday. The winger had the Cotton Bowl crowd on their feet as he netted in the 34th minute before repeating the trick six minutes later. The Blaugrana were ultimately held to a 2-2 draw as Moise Kean also grabbed a brace for Juve, but Dembele stole all the headlines with his electrifying display in the first 45 minutes. Dembele opened the scoring after a sensational solo run that saw him bamboozle Alex Sandro and Juan Cuadrado with his dribbling skills. After getting the better of the two defenders he rifled in a shot at the near post which proved to be too hot to handle for Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.  Although Kean equalised soon after, Dembele put Barca ahead once again in the 40th minute. Cuadrado and Sandro were the victims of his trickery this time as well, as he dribbled past both of them before shooting into the bottom corner.

Barca boss Xavi was delighted to retain the 25-year-old's services and wasn't surprised by his latest showing against Juve. The Spaniard sees Dembele as a ""special"" player and has now challenged him to produce the goods on a more consistent basis. ""He has shown what he is capable of, making a difference from the right wing with one-on-two actions,"" Xavi said after the game. ""He is a different player, special and he gives us a lot. ""He has to make a difference, be more consistent, score more goals. I don't know Dembele from before but since I've arrived, I see him happy and he always tells me that he's involved in the project.

Controversial Le Tissier Bucha tweet amid Ukraine-Russia turmoil leads to him stepping down from role as Southampton ambassador,"Former England midfielder Matt Le Tissier has stepped down from his role as a Southampton ambassador after causing controversy with a Twitter post. Le Tissier has drawn criticism in the past, perhaps most notably when he linked to a conspiracy theorist's view that Christian Eriksen's on-field cardiac arrest may have been linked to the Covid-19 vaccination. And he is again under fire after retweeting a post that questioned the validity of media reports of alleged Russian war crimes in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. In the wake of Russian soldiers being accused of genocide amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the tweet read: ""The media lied about Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Media lied about Covid. The media lied about the Hunter Biden laptop."" Before sarcastically adding: ""But honestly they are telling the truth about Bucha!"" He's chased one too many conspiracies. This one goes too far. pic.twitter.com/qNYJY7gjZX Le Tissier has since deleted the tweet, stating that people ""missed the point, the point was about media manipulation"". He went on to say that he ""decided to step aside"" from his role as a Southampton ambassador. Le Tissier added: ""My views are my own and always have been, and it's important to take this step today to avoid any confusion. This does not affect my relationship with and love for my club and I will always remain a fan. ""I can, however, see that due to recent events it's important to separate the work I believe in from my relationship with the club I have supported and played for most of my life.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/controversial-le-tissier-bucha-tweet-ukraine-russia/blt6a34c08562790c3a,Stephen Crawford,f9b5def2-6096-4f3c-af3f-6d690386c1d2
How do penalty shootouts work? Rules of soccer format explained,"Penalty shootouts are some of the most nerve-wracking and stressful situations ‚Äì for both players partaking and the viewers sitting anxiously at home, chewing their fingernails off in agony.¬† Add the high stakes of what a shootout means as well as the anticipation period when a player runs up and shoots a penalty for the net in one of the most dramatic situations in football ‚Äì sudden death in a last 16 game, the decider of a Cup final, the shootout to determine the winner of the World Cup. But how do penalty shootouts work, and what are the rules? GOAL takes a look. In regular match play, a foul committed by a player in the penalty box on the opposition is a penalty ‚Äì usually in the case of being fouled when through on goal, or through handball. The ball is then placed on the ""penalty spot"", which is 12 yards from the goal in the centre of¬†the box, where one chosen player from the fouled team will be selected to convert a penalty one-on-one against the goalkeeper. The attacker obviously holds a deliberate advantage, as the keeper does not know where he will shoot the ball until he¬†takes his shot. Penalty shootouts only take place during the knockout phases of a competition, such as the last 16 of a major international tournament like the World Cup, Euros or club competition such as the Champions League. They are to decide the scoreline of a knockout game if, by the end of regular or extra time the score is still even ‚Äì as one team will need to be able to progress through to the next stage. Penalty shootouts do not occur during the league season, as the outcome¬†of the clubs' finishing¬†is determined by points. In the event of a shootout, both teams select five players to take a penalty and alternate the order in doing so (ABAB). Prior to the shootout, the captains of the two teams will meet with the referee first to determine at which end of the pitch the shootout will take place in, and a second coin toss to decide which team will take lead the shootout. The team with the most penalties scored after the first five takes wins the shootout.¬† However, if one side has scored more successful penalties than the other could possibly reach with all of its remaining kicks, the shoot-out ends, regardless of the number of kicks remaining ‚Äì this is called ""best of five kicks"". An example of this is the 2006 World Cup final, when the shootout ended after Italy's¬†Fabio Grosso¬†had scored his teams fifth, despite the fact that France (on 3) still had one more to go. If, after five penalties scored it is still tied, penalties continue through one back-and-forth round at a time ‚Äì and the first team to have an advantage after a round between both teams wins. This is known as¬†sudden death. Then, the team that scores the most successful kicks by the end of the shoot-out will be the winner of the match. In the event that the scoreline after 90 minutes of regular play is still even, the match will continue with two 15-minute periods of extra time in order to determine a winner. During the 30 minutes of extra time, teams will either play with a nervous, restless energy if they want to find a match-winner or either slow and lethargically if they want to take it to a shootout.¬† It is not unusual for extra time to finish with the score still even or the same from the end of the 90 minutes, which send both teams to the penalty shootout high on nerves and adrenaline ‚Äì with the team's fatigue and exhaustion only adding to the schadenfreude of shootout melodrama. In a penalty shootout, each team has five shots and the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. The fifth penalty is often seen as the most important one, as it can be the most decisive. If the scores are even by the fifth round, and then the opposition team misses their fifth penalty, then the other team can win the shootout by scoring in a 5-4 win. Because the fifth penalties can be the deciding factor, there is an intense amount of pressure that comes along with scoring it. This is why a team's best player ‚Äì or go-to penalty-taker ‚Äì¬†is often saved for this occasion, instead of being scheduled to score early on in the shootout. They would ideally be the most equipped, mentally, to take on such a task, with the best chance of success. Of course, this tactic has the ability to backfire, especially if a team doesn't even end up making it to the fifth round due to penalties being missed. FIFA has trialled a new format for penalty-taking in smaller competitions, though decided against introducing it at the 2018 World Cup. As penalty shootouts are mostly taken under the ABAB format¬†‚Äì where teams alternate between taking penalties with player from team A, then player from team B rotating ‚Äì¬†there has been a trend that the team who begin the shootout win 60 per cent of the shootouts. As such, FIFA has tested a new format of ABBA, where teams take two penalties in a row ‚Äì built like a tennis tiebreaker. It has been used at UEFA youth tournaments as well as the Carabao Cup in England, though it has reverted to the ABAB system since the 2018-19 season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-do-penalty-shootouts-work-rules-of-soccer-format/1sr4qwpaaiw5x1mqh55c2ar6mt,GOAL,8a898787-308f-4712-8d49-13bae8ea43c8

Conte jokes that tripping Tuchel would have been 'well deserved' during Chelsea coach's wild celebrations,"Tottenham coach Antonio Conte has added another instalment to his feud with Chelsea rival Thomas Tuchel following the latest ‚ÄòBattle of the Bridge‚Äô between two London neighbours, with the Italian claiming it would have been ‚Äúwell deserved‚Äù had he tripped the German during wild goal celebrations. The Blues‚Äô second effort in a thrilling 2-2 draw, which came courtesy of Reece James, resulted in Tuchel racing past Conte on his way down the touchline. The Spurs boss had his head down in disappointment at the time, with Harry Kane going on to snatch a late leveller for the visitors, and says he would have taken action ‚Äì having previously clashed with a fellow tactician when seeing his own side hit the net ‚Äì had he spotted an opportunity to stick out a leg. The former Juventus and Inter coach has posted on Instagram alongside a video of Tuchel tearing past him in Jose Mourinho-esque fashion: ‚ÄúLucky I didn‚Äôt see you‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúMaking you trip over would have been well deserved.‚Äù Two passionate characters clashed for the first time at Stamford Bridge when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg cancelled out Kalidou Koulibaly‚Äôs stunning opener for Chelsea. With the Blues adamant that a free-kick should have been awarded to them prior to Spurs‚Äô goal being scored, Tuchel was less than impressed when a fired-up Conte took to celebrating in his direction. The pair had to be separated as an unsightly melee broke out, but neither was done there as they squared up again at the final whistle. During a post-game handshake, Tuchel refused to let go of Conte‚Äôs arm and appeared to suggest that the Italian should look him in the eye when going through such formalities.

Schmeichel shares emotional thread of Leicester moments following move to Nice after '11 incredible seasons',"Kasper Schmeichel has shared a thread of his 'favourite memories' as a Leicester player after completing a transfer to Nice. The 35-year-old confirmed the move on social media and leaves for the Ligue 1 outfit following a mammoth spell with the Foxes, where he was crowned a Premier League champion against all odds in 2016. In a heartfelt series of messages shared on Twitter, Schmeichel has looked back on some of the highlights from his time at King Power Stadium after signing in 2011. Kicking off the thread by recalling Leicester's promotion to the top flight in 2014, the Danish goalkeeper quickly moved on to highlight details of their historic Premier League win. Sharing images of himself and teammates celebrating with the trophy and medals, he described it as a ""dream come true"" and admitted he isn't sure if a moment will ever come close to the achievement. Schmeichel also shared an image of him and David Beckham holding the Premier League trophy together, recalling what he described as an ""afternoon [he] will never forget"" due to the fact he'd grown up watching the Englishman lift the trophy so often.

Schmeichel stated: ""A tough period but showing the unity that embodies exactly what Leicester are about (2018)"" Closing off the celebration of his Leicester career, he discussed their 2021 triumphs in winning both the FA Cup and Community Shield, noting that the former was a ""historic and proud moment"". Rounding off his tributes, Schmeichel finished by saying thank you to fans, teammates and people behind the scenes who made his 11 seasons ""so special"".

De Bruyne raises Man City alarm bells after coming off against Atletico,"Manchester City will be paying close attention to the fitness of Kevin De Bruyne following the inspirational midfielder's withdrawal in the second half of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid.  De Bruyne came off just after the hour mark with City struggling to defend their slender 1-0 advantage from the first leg in the Wanda Metropolitano.  His club will hope he has escaped serious injury as they hope to continue fighting on multiple fronts in the final months of the 2021-22 season.  The Belgian pulled up in discomfort while on the run during the second half of the quarter-final second leg, just as Atletico began to push forward in their search for an equaliser.  He was unable to continue, and limped off as Raheem Sterling was brought in to replace him.  City were dealt a further blow minutes later when full-back Kyle Walker left the action due to injury.  Walker had clashed with Renan Lodi and despite receiving treatment was ultimately obliged to leave the field, replaced by Nathan Ake.  Now Pep Guardiola will hope neither of his key first-teamers has sustained lasting damage with a huge match on the horizon.  On Saturday City take on Liverpool in the semi final of the FA Cup, just a week after the Premier League high-fliers shared the points in an enthralling 2-2 that left the former at the top of the table by a single point.

Man Utd captain Maguire receives 'serious threat' to family home as police investigate,"A spokesperson for Harry Maguire has confirmed that a threat was reported at the Manchester United captain's home, with police investigating the incident. Police were sent to Maguire's home amid an anonymous threat, with authorities now searching for the culprit of a reported bomb threat. The incident comes shortly after Maguire's Man Utd were defeated 4-0 by rivals Liverpool at Anfield. ‚ÄúIn the last 24 hours, Harry has received a serious threat to his family home,"" a Man Utd spokesman said. ""He has reported this to the police who are now looking into the matter. ""The safety of his family and those around him is obviously Harry‚Äôs number one priority. ""He will continue to prepare for this weekend‚Äôs fixture as normal and we will not be commenting in any further detail at this time."" The Man Utd captain has been a source of constant criticism throughout what has been an up and down season for the club. Maguire has featured 35 times in all competitions this campaign, having made the move to Man Utd from Leicester for¬†a record-breaking ¬£80 million ($113m). The club currently sits sixth in the Premier League, three points behind fourth-place Tottenham and fifth-place Arsenal with both having a game in hand on the Red Devils.

adidas and Arsenal celebrate Jamaican supporters with a bold new 2022-23 pre-match jersey,"Launching just in time for the long-awaited return of Carnival, adidas and Arsenal work their magic once again to release a stunning pre-match jersey, celebrating the club's Jamaican supporters.  Inspired by the energy and style of the Jamaican community in London, the new Arsenal pre-match jersey features a bold all-over geometric print in green, gold and black - the colours of Jamaica's flag. The jersey will be showcased across the weekend at Notting Hill Carnival, returning after a two-year absence due to the pandemic.  Arsenal legend, Ian Wright MBE, who was born in London to Jamaican parents, said: ‚ÄúThis is much more than a pre-match jersey for me. It represents Arsenal‚Äôs history of supporting its players, fans, and communities, far and wide. The club was always a safe place for me to celebrate all the different parts of my history and heritage.‚Äù The 2022-23 pre-match jersey will be seen on the pitch for the first time when the men's team host Fulham in the Premier League on Saturday, August 27.

Man Utd want Arnautovic and Sesko transfers in effort to boost attack,"Manchester United want to sign veteran Bologna striker Marko Arnautovic but will also try to secure a deal for RB Salzburg's Benjamin Sesko, GOAL understands. Erik ten Hag wants more depth in attack and sees the former Stoke and West Ham forward as a valuable squad player while seeing the younger Sesko as a long-term asset. The need for reinforcements up front was underlined by the 2-1 defeat to Brighton on Sunday, which saw Bruno Fernandes deployed as a false No.9. Ten Hag believes 33-year-old Arnautovic can add experience and versatility to his forward line as a player capable of playing in wide positions or through the middle.  At a cost of around ¬£8 million, the Bologna forward is also seen as an inexpensive option to boost numbers.  It is believed the player, who scored 14 goals last season, is also keen on a move to Old Trafford.   With Cristiano Ronaldo eager to leave this summer and Anthony Martial the club's only other senior striker, United are short of options up front.  Arnautovic is considered a different profile to United's other forwards and is known to Ten Hag, who worked with him at Twente. It is believed a bid has already been made - but sources are adamant he is not considered a replacement for Ronaldo. The Dutchman was coy when questioned about his interest ‚Äì but did not deny he wanted to bring the Austrian in.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go into names,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn this pre-season maybe 250 players are linked with Manchester United, so that is it.  ‚ÄúWe have two strikers, maybe a third with [Marcus] Rashford. We considered him (to play centre-forward) but he had a really good pre-season on the left side and today he had two good chances so I think it was a good decision to play him there.‚Äù United are among a host of clubs interested in 19-year-old Sesko and are trying to secure a deal before the close of the transfer window.  But Salzburg‚Äôs asking price of around ¬£50 million ($60m) is seen as too high for the inexperienced teenager.  The club accept there has been a short-term approach to forwards in recent years with the signings of Odion Ighalo, Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo, who wants to leave the club. Sesko is seen as evidence of their determination to identify future stars.

Lukaku earns shot at Chelsea redemption ahead of Club World Cup final ,"It was hardly 1001 Arabian Nights but Romelu Lukaku's five-game goal drought felt just as long at times. However, it finally came to an end on Wednesday night, as the Chelsea centre forward's 32nd-minute strike earned his side a 1-0 victory over Al-Hilal in a tight game at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. Lukaku has come in for a lot of criticism of late but he was a constant threat against a team that pushed the Blues to the limit, despite their underdog status. Indeed, this felt like a big night for the big Belgian, who, when the full-time whistle blew, dropped to the ground along with several other Blues players. There was a lot of pressure on both Lukaku and his team-mates going into a Club World Cup tournament that everybody expects Chelsea to win. Assistant coach Zsolt Low even revealed afterwards that the team needed some words of encouragement at half-time from manager Thomas Tuchel, who had to stay at home in London after testing positive for Covid-19 last week. ""We had a good conversation,"" Low told reporters. ""Thomas had the same feeling that we were a little nervous and had a lot of easy ball losses. ""We talked about telling the guys to calm down, find the rhythm and not fight so hard for hard solutions."" It's easy to understand why the players may have been feeling the pressure. The chance to become world champions doesn't come around often, as Chelsea know all too well. They've only been here once before and the shock loss to Corinthians in the 2012 Club World Cup final remains one of the club's most disappointing defeats. On occasions such as these, the responsibility often falls on goalscorers to step up to the mark and, thankfully, that's exactly what Lukaku did on the night. ""Everyone's very happy he scored,"" Low admitted in his post-match press conference. ""He fought very hard and tried hard in the last game. ""That's why we give him the chance all the time. We hoped for a bit of luck to score today. He's very happy, we're very happy and hope he continues and scores in the final."" It's obviously far too early to say the club's record signing has turned a corner.¬† Decisive goals are the least that's expected of the the ¬£97.5 million ($136m) signing from Inter and a solitary strike against Al-Hilal won't appease those supporters who remain upset by the comments he made about Tuchel's tactics and his enduring love for the Nerazzurri in an unsanctioned interview with Sky¬†Sport Italia in December.¬† Tuchel's appeal for the fans to forgive and forget is only likely to be heard when Lukaku starts winning matches on a consistent basis. However, Hakim Ziyech, who has been Chelsea's best attacker in recent weeks, also feels that Lukaku deserves more understanding when it comes to discussing his struggles so far this season. The decisive moment! üôå#ClubWorldCuppic.twitter.com/tyLpj002i8. ""There is no question of his quality,"" the winger argued. ""In the beginning, it was all good, but then, after he came back from injury, he caught Covid. ""I also think that everybody in the squad, not only me but everybody, [needs to provide chances for him]. ""Some teams we are playing against, they play in a back five. He is by himself against three defenders. Is that not hard? ""It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, if you have three defenders against you, it is hard to find space. ""For example, even if he [beats] one, then another one arrives. He also needs space to make his runs. ""So, I think that helping him is something we have to work on. Sometimes in games, it‚Äôs really good, but other times, a bit less. There is still a lot of room to improve. ""But there is no question over his quality. He's shown it for the last few years. It is just a matter of time."" Lukaku has certainly achieved a lot in his career but, for Chelsea, the time is now. Roman Abramovich is likely to be at the final with a host of staff, while Tuchel is also expected to be in attendance, as long as he secures a negative test before Saturday. The magnitude of becoming world champions will, of course, weigh heavy on the Blues.  They need to face the Palmeiras challenge with great enthusiasm and concentration as the Copa Libertadores winners will be taking his game as seriously as every South American finalist before them. ""They are going to play for everything,"" Chelsea's Brazil-born Italy midfielder Jorginho warned. ""This is very important for a team in Brazil. ""It is the same for us but definitely, we are going to give everything in this final and we need to be prepared. ""I think [they want to prove they are better than European teams]. For them, that‚Äôs a big thing. They are going to come for us. We need to be prepared for that."" The Blues have won 20 trophies in 19 years under Abramovich but they've never lifted the Club World Cup. If Lukaku wants to feel like royalty in one of the wealthiest kingdoms in the Arab world, then he has to step up again on Saturday. The throne is there for the taking, as is a golden chance to mend his relationship with Chelsea's fans.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-earns-chelsea-himself-shot-at-redemption-club-world/bltb5dc90752a94885e,Nizaar Kinsella,d9327117-9e23-4972-98f6-97e339416293
Bayern Munich star Kimmich open to transfer abroad as midfielder reveals he thought about leaving already,"Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder Joshua Kimmich has admitted that he is tempted by the thought of playing outside of the Bundesliga.  Kimmich has grown into a key part of the Bayern set-up since moving to Bavaria as a youngster from RB Leipzig.  But while he seems in no hurry to leave Die Roten, he would consider a challenge away from Germany in the future. ""That would be an interesting challenge. I don't know what will happen in a few years, we'll see,"" the 27-year-old affirmed in an interview with So Foot.  ""I have a very good coach who is an advocate of attractive football. I have a lot of fun here, but somewhere in my head there is always this professional and personal challenge of one day reaching new horizons to discover."" Kimmich was just short of his 20th birthday when he first arrived at Bayern, having impressed in the lower leagues with Leipzig prior to their jump up to the Bundesliga.  In spite of his age and the step up in quality, the midfielder quickly established himself as a first-team asset during his debut season, and has gone on to make almost 300 appearances for Bayern in the last seven years, either in midfield or as a utility defender.  Kimmich is also a regular for Germany, reaching 66 caps and four goals for the nation since his 2016 debut.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-star-kimmich-open-to-transfer-abroad/blt0666fdc2198687ff,Daniel Edwards,bb83d81e-1c85-43bd-9930-f299f2771944
Salah: Ballon d'Or result 'shocked me' but I can still die feeling accomplished,"Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has said he was shocked by the results of 2021 Ballon d'Or voting when he finished in seventh place, saying that no one in the world expected him to be so low in the final tally. However, the Egyptian maintains that he has already done enough in his career to die feeling accomplished. Salah reached the Africa Cup of Nations final this year and is again leading Liverpool in a tight Premier League title chase. ""It shocked me [not doing better in Ballon d'Or voting], but there's nothing I can say. No one in the world expected that I would be seventh, but that's what happened,"" Salah said on Egyptian TV and the DMC channel. On not making the FIFA World XI, he said: ""I do not feel the conspiracy theory, but there may be inaccurate choices, and there are many countries which aren't popular with football knowledge and so far from it. I do not know their choices based on what, but I do not believe in the conspiracy theory. ""I don't have the feeling that there is anything personal against me specifically in the FIFA choices, but this is the reality we are dealing with."" Salah also discussed how he was grateful for many things in his career. ""There are no words to describe how I feel about people's positive comments towards me or to be a reason for their hope,"" he said. ""Today, if I died, It would be after achieving a lot of things that I wanted to achieve. ""People don't realize how happy I am when I come to play for the national team, it's an honor for me to wear the national team shirt. ""The most important match I played in my life was the qualifying match for the World Cup 2018 against Congo, my happiness after the winning goal was indescribable."" Salah has the chance to finish higher than seventh in the 2022 Ballon d'Or voting, especially if Liverpool win the Premier League or Champions League. The forward has 19 goals and 10 assists in domestic league action this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/salah-ballon-d-or-result-shocked-me-but-i-can-still-die/bltadd2e46e99750d17,Dan Bernstein,1c958e7c-7491-45a0-b61e-af5a39f9f8b8
Ramsdale out injured for Arsenal with hip problem to throw doubt on England hopes,"Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale will miss Saturday's Premier League trip to Aston Villa with a hip injury, throwing the Gunners man's participation in England's March international break into doubt. The shot-stopper has arguably been the in-form keeper of the season in the top-flight, and a cornerstone of the north London club's revival this term under Mikel Arteta, who have emerged as Champions League-chasing contenders. But he was absent entirely from the team for Saturday's game at Villa Park, as the visitors look to consolidate a top-four berth, with the club confirming that he had been ruled out due to a problem with his hip, with Bernd Leno named as his replacement. ""Aaron Ramsdale had a muscle injury and will be out for a few weeks,"" Arteta confirmed when asked by BT Sport ahead of kick-off at Villa Park. The Spaniard also touched on Gabriel Martinelli's absence, with the Brazilian also absent from the trip to Villa Park. ""Gabriel Martinelli‚Äôs been sick the last few days, so he‚Äôs out of the squad unfortunately,"" Arteta added."" Having been called up as a late addition for last summer's Euro 2020 squad, the Gunners man made his Three Lions debut against San Marino in November as Gareth Southgate fielded a second-string side. But his form has proven the biggest threat to Jordan Pickford's tenure between the posts since the Everton man became first-choice for England, suggesting that he could well have started this month's games with Switzerland and Ivory Coast. With Ramsdale reportedly out for a couple of weeks however, he will be unlikely to feature at all and may instead remain with Arsenal to recover his fitness, with an eye to inclusion for this summer's slate of fixtures and the Qatar 2022 World Cup later this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ramsdale-out-injured-arsenal-hip-problem-throw-doubt-england/blt88005a172021ad83,Andrew Steel,4257dd29-a3d8-445d-b4e9-b3a6956e7605

The home team will have limited sting without summer signings Angel Di Maria and Paul Pogba available but will be hoping that Dusan Vlahovic can deliver after the Serbian's brace in Juve's 3-0 win over Sassuolo in their season opener.

Reyna will be like a 'new signing' as Dortmund reveal what position USMNT star might play,"Gio Reyna is free from injury again at Borussia Dortmund, with the United States international being tipped to be ‚Äúlike a new signing‚Äù for the Bundesliga outfit as he prepares to step back into the fold. The highly-rated 19-year-old midfielder has been out of action since picking up a hamstring problem while away with his country on World Cup qualifying duty in September 2021. He has sat out 25 games for BVB, as they look to keep themselves in the hunt for major silverware, but is back in full training and could make a welcome return to action in a home date with Bayer Leverkusen on February 6. With Reyna coming back into contention for Marco Rose‚Äôs side, Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc told Ruhr Nachrichten of the impact the talented teenager could make: ‚ÄúGio is almost like a new signing for the second half of the season. ‚ÄúHe had an excellent start to the season in the summer and unfortunately we missed him for a long time. We hope that he now tolerates the strain in training well.‚Äù Dortmund have fared admirably in Reyna‚Äôs absence, although they did slip out of the Champions League at the group stage and sit six points adrift of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga title race. The USMNT star will be eager to make an immediate impact upon his return, having registered two goals through five appearances earlier in the campaign. Rose must decide where best to utilise the youngster‚Äôs obvious ability, with Zorc expecting Reyna to fill a playmaking post. He added on where the creative influence will fit into the Dortmund side: ‚ÄúIn 4-3-3 he has already played very well. ‚ÄúHe can help us in midfield as an eight and also on the wing, although he's not a classic winger and tends to move into the centre from there. ‚ÄúHe is characterised by his very fine sense of which spaces he has to move into and where he can turn up between the opposing lines. The further up the field he plays, the more dangerous he becomes.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/reyna-new-signing-dortmund-what-position-usmnt-star-might/bltc97a9db82427baba,Chris Burton,62a50309-4bc8-41c5-8538-a66749a0ecaa
Will Ferrell sent Bale personal message telling him to join LAFC from Real Madrid,"Hollywood star Will Ferrell played a role in Gareth Bale's surprise move to Los Angeles FC, sending the forward a personalised message asking him to join the club. Ferrell is part of LAFC's star-studded ownership group, which also includes NBA legend Magic Johnson and former USWNT star Mia Hamm. Bale has added further glamour to the franchise, with the Welshman signing a 12-month contract back in June. Prior to agreeing to join LAFC, the former Real Madrid man had been linked with hometown club Cardiff City, but the club's ownership were successful in tempting him over to the United States. LAFC co-president John Thorrington explained the film star's role in the transfer during an interview with the PA News Agency. ""I can't remember exactly what stage in the conversation it was but he did receive a personal message from Will Ferrell,"" Thorrington said. ""We have an amazing group of owners, who are very committed to delivering on these lofty ambitions."" ""I will tell you the absolute, honest truth, until I saw a signature I never believed it would happen,"" Thorrington added. ""But everything trended positively throughout and it was a fairly linear process. It was sort of step by step. He had some questions and we would bring in that expert to talk about it - whether that would be our strength and conditioning staff, whether it was bringing an owner into the conversation. ""We just had probably five, six conversations, and I think each got us a step closer to the deal. We were a totally different opportunity and I was not surprised to hear there was competition in Europe. ""But I think what helped is Gareth's knowledge of LA, getting to know what the club offered, which was unique relative to the other options, and we were grateful that the stars aligned, and we're able to do."" Bale has got off to a strong start in MLS, netting twice in just 96 minutes of action so far and ending up on the winning side in each of his four league appearances. He netted a stunner for LAFC earlier this month, motoring past two Real Salt Lake players before cutting inside and firing a left-footed shot into the back of the net.

Man Utd and Chelsea target Rice handed two-game European ban after West Ham referee rant,"West Ham midfielder Declan Rice has been handed a two-game ban by UEFA, after the Manchester United and Chelsea target launched an angry rant at officials following the conclusion of his side's Europa League exit against Eintracht Frankfurt last month. The England international was seen launching a furious tirade at referee Jesus Gil Manzano in a video taken after the Hammers' fairytale run through Europe came to a close in the last four, in an ill-tempered encounter that also saw team-mate Aaron Cresswell and manager David Moyes sent off. The latter said the club would take no punishment against their star man, but now UEFA have handed down a double-match suspension to Rice that rules him out of the club's next two continental fixtures. In the wake of the game, which West Ham lost 1-0 to seal their European exit, Rice was seen raging at referee Manzano after a performance by the latter deemed to be substandard by the irate playmaker. ""Ref, ref, it's so poor, all night, it's so bad,"" the midfielder was seen to shout. ""How can you be that bad, honestly? You've probably been paid."" Frankfurt went on to win the Europa League later that month, with victory over Scottish outfit Rangers. Despite assurances from Moyes that their star man will not go anywhere, Rice's exploits last season - on the back of a sublime Euro 2020 campaign that helped steer England to the final - the midfielder remains a key target for both Manchester United and Chelsea. Both clubs would have to fork out a likely eye-watering sum to bring the Three Lions man on board, and the likelihood of Rice being able to force an exit is also likely moot, given that his contract runs through until 2024. But even if he was to make a move, his UEFA ban would remain intact, meaning he would miss the first two games of European competition at either club next season, just as he will otherwise miss West Ham's Europa Conference League playoffs in August if he stays.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-chelsea-target-rice-handed-ban-west-ham-referee-rant/blta73e72d627040ef7,Andrew Steel,a4b29c00-3cd2-45ef-b6f0-2c582f034612
Barcelona Femeni complete perfect season after final day win over Atletico Madrid,"Barcelona Femeni have completed a perfect season after their final day win over Atletico Madrid. Lluis Cortes' side initially secured a third successive Primera Division title on March 13 following a comprehensive 5-0 Clasico win over arch-rivals Real Madrid. Barca secured the trophy with six games to spare but didn't take their foot off the gas after celebrating that achievement, and have now finished the campaign with maximum points. Goals from Irene Paredes and Aitana Bonmati gave Barca a 2-1 home win against Atletico, who lost out on the final Champions League spot to Madrid as a result. The Blaugrana scored a staggering 159 goals across their 30 victories in 2021-22 while conceding only 11 at the other end of the pitch.

Watch: Messi snaps at Ramos after rash tackle in PSG training,"Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos were once fierce rivals on opposing sides of a Clasico divide in Spain, and it appears as though those days at Barcelona and Real Madrid have not been entirely forgotten following an exchange of words in Paris Saint-Germain training. The pair are currently in Japan as PSG step up their preparations for the 2022-23 campaign. Messi skipped past a World Cup-winning defender during an exercise ahead of a friendly clash with Gamba Osaka, but he was caught after showing the Spaniard a clean pair of heels and appeared to let the former Real captain know that he was less than impressed after lashing the ball into the bottom corner. The pair were caught on camera during an open training session, with Ramos catching Messi with an outstretched boot after being unable to prevent the seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner from slipping beyond him. The mercurial Argentine suffered no lasting damage at the hands of a club colleague, with his quick feet allowing him to avoid heavy contact before drilling into the back of the net. Indeed, Messi also bounced back to net his second goal in four pre-season outings as PSG thrashed Gamba Osaka 6-2 on Monday. The hope is that a spark will be found by an all-time great heading into his second campaign with the reigning Ligue 1 champions. Messi only managed 11 efforts through all competitions last season, with just six of those strikes coming in the French top-flight, but he is under contract for another 12 months and will believe that there is much more to come ‚Äì if Ramos can avoid sending him to the treatment room.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-messi-snaps-ramos-rash-tackle-psg-training/bltcd2d7b7085a4bae2,Chris Burton,8092643e-13d2-4831-84de-eb78e715fc75
Tuchel reveals why he shouted at Jorginho during Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final win vs Crystal Palace,"Thomas Tuchel has revealed why he shouted at Jorginho during Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final win against Crystal Palace. Chelsea reached the FA Cup final for a third successive season after beating Palace 2-0 at Wembley on Sunday, thanks to goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount. Jorginho played 77 minutes of the contest before being replaced by N'Golo Kante, but was guilty of wasting possession on a number of occasions and Tuchel was seen berating the midfielder from the touchline. The Chelsea boss has now admitted that he was too ""hard"" on Jorginho, who he believes is suffering from burnout after another hectic season. Tuchel also thinks Italy's surprise exit from the 2022 World Cup qualification playoffs is weighing heavy on the 30-year-old's shoulders, as he told reporters on Tuesday: ‚ÄúHe played injured, sacrificed for the team. I think you see it now. You can never underestimate how much pressure is on playing for the national team, the country, for Italy.  ""The demands are high after big success like winning the Euros. I think he really felt the pressure there, everybody for Italy felt it. This is normal. Sometimes after big successes, it's very difficult to keep on going.  ""He put a lot of responsibility naturally on his shoulders because he is never shy to do so. He is never shy to do it here, this is why I love him.  ""It‚Äôs true, I was very hard on him during the match. He had some situations he could do better and normally does. It is never personal. I love Jorgi. I know that he knows it.  ""We see now we overused him, I have the feeling we see the consequences of these huge number of matches.  ""If he plays he is always fully involved, gives everything and plays with a lot of effort. He has to be absolutely fresh to have the influence he normally has.  ""He is not mentally, physically in the freshest moment at the minute. He is not to blame. It affects how I analyse it, he had two or three situations where he could do better [vs Palace].  ""Nothing personal. Nothing that stands between us.‚Äù Jorginho's appearance against Palace marked his 41st outing in all competitions in 2021-22, as he has once again played a key role in Chelsea's hunt for silverware on multiple fronts. The Italy international has started 34 of those games, recording nine goals and four assists, and could be in line for a well-earned rest when the Blues welcome Arsenal to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Chelsea will, however, still need a fully fit Jorginho over the coming weeks as they seek to make sure of a top-four spot and end the season with a trophy - with an FA Cup final date against Liverpool on May 14 now looming large on the horizon.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-reveals-why-shouted-at-jorginho-chelsea-fa-cup-semi-final-/blt3301a62b87fabaa7,James Westwood,7f3ca89f-f338-4da6-b6be-96457e8e8a32
'The boss has balls' - Arsenal reactions to Arteta stripping Aubameyang of captaincy revealed in All or Nothing,"The latest episode of the All or Nothing series centring around Arsenal has shown a behind-the-scenes look at Mikel Arteta's decision to strip Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of the captaincy, as well as the squad's reaction. Aubameyang was stripped of the captaincy after arriving late for training, with the Gabon international's history of tardiness earning him discipline several times under Arteta.  The Spanish manager made the forward train alone and, eventually, allowed him to join Barcelona on a free transfer. The show offers a glimpse into the moment Arteta informed the squad of his decision as he addressed the Arsenal players about Aubameyang's punishment. ""I have to announce something. Following the last disciplinary issue that we had with Auba, and the consequences that I decided to take not to involve him in the game, I thought carefully ‚Äì myself and the club ‚Äì what was the next step,"" Arteta said. ""We have decided as a club that he is no longer our captain, so you should know that. The other decision is that, for now, he‚Äôs not involved in the squad. I will make decisions further along the line."" He continued: ""The club and myself we are not going to accept any behaviour like this, and what we are building goes completely against any behaviour like that. ""So if we are going to have any meaning in changing our culture ‚Äì and making sure we become a different club and team ‚Äì we have to stand to those words, clearly, in every action, with anybody. This is the message that I have to send you."" Mohamed Elneny and Rob Holding both seemingly supported Arteta‚Äôs decision, saying it shows ""the boss has balls"". After joining Barca on February 2, Aubameyang made his debut four days later in a 4-2 win over Atletico Madrid.  He scored his first goals in a hat-trick against Valencia on February 20 as he went on to finish with 13 goals in 23 appearances for the club.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-arteta-aubameyang-captaincy-all-or-nothing/blte3daba4478a35c73,Ryan Tolmich,2ece2fbc-95a5-4935-8923-07ce83a85c4c
Ronaldo cautioned by police for smashing Everton supporter's phone,"Cristiano Ronaldo has been cautioned by Merseyside Police after he smashed a young Everton fan's mobile phone back in April. As he and his team-mates left the pitch following their 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park, the Portuguese superstar was filmed angrily slapping the device out of 14-year-old Jacob Harding's hand. He subsequently apologised to the youngster before being voluntarily interviewed by Merseyside Police under caution in relation to an alleged assault and criminal damage. Following the interview and their investigation into the incident, the matter was dealt with ""by way of conditional caution"". The full statement raleased by the police read: ‚ÄúWe can confirm that a 37-year-old man voluntarily attended and was interviewed under caution in relation to an allegation of assault and criminal damage. ""The allegation relates to an incident following the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison Park on Saturday 9 April. ""The matter has been dealt with by way of conditional caution. The matter has now concluded.‚Äù After the footage of Ronaldo's outburst made its way into the public domain via social media, the Red Devils forward released an apology which include the offer of a visit to Old Trafford to watch a Premier League fixture. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing,"" he wrote. ""Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. ‚ÄúI would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.‚Äù However, that offer was declined by the young boy's mother.

Afcon 2021: Senegal President Sall rewards players after historic triumph,"Senegal President Macky Sall has rewarded the players and coaches of the Lions of Teranga for emerging as champions of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Aliou Cisse‚Äôs men defeated Egypt on penalties at the Olembe Stadium to lift the African diadem for the first time ever, with Sadio Mane scoring the winning penalty in the dramatic shoot-out. During a reception held at the presidential palace in Dakar on Tuesday evening, the West African country‚Äôs leader gave each of the players and coaches a plot of land in Dakar. Also, they were also rewarded $87,000 individually as President Sall bestowed upon them Senegal‚Äôs highest order, making them Grand Officers of the National Order of the Lion. ‚ÄúIn addition, as a token of gratitude, and on behalf of the nation, the players and other members of the official delegation will each receive a special bonus of 50 million franc CFA ($87,412) and a 200 square metre plot of land in Dakar,‚Äù said Sall as quoted by Metro. The country‚Äôs number one citizen, who participated at the African Union summit over the weekend, added that the Lions of Teranga would also receive a 500 square metre plot in a memorial estate in Diamniadio, a new futuristic economic and industrial hub around 45 km from Dakar where a new national stadium will be inaugurated on Feb. 22. President Sall told players they had reached the ""summit of Africa"" while praising coach Cisse for his efforts. ‚ÄúHere you are, on top of Africa. Thanks to your fighting spirit, your talent and your commitment, you have brought back to us the pride and honour that marks great people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThank you to coach Aliou 'El Tactico'. As I said, he doesn't talk much, he doesn't make noise, but he is efficient, and he brought us the Africa Cup with his valiant team. ‚ÄúThank you, from all those who were with you. Through quiet strength and imperturbable serenity, you have shown your qualities as a leader of men."" The Senegalese government had declared Monday as a public holiday following the country‚Äôs success in Cameroon.

Dybala transfer news: Ex-Juventus striker labels Totti 'an icon' but gives little away amid Roma & Inter links,"Paulo Dybala says he was happy to hear Roma legend Francesco Totti's praise of him but refused to say whether or not he would join the Serie A side. Dybala is a free agent ahead of next season as his contract with Juventus will expire this summer. Roma and Inter are among the teams after him, with Italy icon Totti saying he would try to convince Dybala to make the move to the capital city and going as far as to proclaim he would hand over his legendary No.10 shirt. Interviewed by Sky Sport at a charity match on Monday, Dybala said he is still unsure where he will end up. ""Future? I don't know yet what I will do, I will choose what's best for me,"" he said.

‚ÄòLewandowski for a season? I‚Äôd buy him‚Äô ‚Äì Liverpool striker transfer talk assessed by James,"Liverpool know that, having missed out on the Premier League title by a solitary point in 2021-22, Manchester City will have Erling Haaland on their books next season, and David James says he would take Robert Lewandowski to Anfield if an opportunity presented itself to sign the prolific Polish striker. The former Reds goalkeeper is not convinced that Jurgen Klopp needs to be concerning himself too much with responding to another show of intent from City in the transfer market when it comes to goalscorers, with there already plenty of firepower on Merseyside. James is, however, prepared to admit that any chance to acquire a two-time FIFA Best Award winner ‚Äì one that is preparing to sever ties with Bayern Munich this summer and has worked with Klopp in the past at Borussia Dortmund ‚Äì would be difficult to pass up. Quizzed on whether a man that has netted 40-plus goals for Bayern in each of the last seven seasons would be a shrewd addition to Liverpool‚Äôs star-studded ranks, ex-Reds shot-stopper James ‚Äì speaking in association with Genting Casino ‚Äì told GOAL: ‚ÄúThis guy is incredible. His goal spread in regards to home and away is nearly equal. He doesn‚Äôt mind where he is, he will score goals. ‚ÄúThe thing with Haaland is that only five games has he scored one goal, the rest of the time he has scored two or three. He is like buses, they come in multiples, whereas Lewandowski doesn‚Äôt care ‚Äì he will score more than half as single goals in games. ‚ÄúLewandowski, with this guy, he just scores. He doesn‚Äôt need to score three, he will always get one. You know you are going to concede. It‚Äôs the mindset of the opposition. ‚ÄúLewandowski for a season? I would buy him. He might cost a few quid, but for a season it might be worth the expense. For however many years now he guarantees goals. If it was that easy at Bayern, then everyone else would be scoring 40 goals.‚Äù Liverpool do not have an out-and-out goalscorer on their books in the Haaland or Lewandowski mould, but that is because their system does not require one ‚Äì with the likes of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane managing to keep things ticking over in the final third. Roberto Firmino has often been the man asked to lead the line, with his selfless work rate making him an ideal fit for Klopp‚Äôs ‚Äògegenpressing‚Äô approach, and James sees no reason why a side that has won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in 2022, while also reaching the Champions League final, should worry about what others are doing. He said when pressed on whether Liverpool need to find a more natural focal point for their attack: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a difficult argument to have. City have got to work out how they are going to play with, theoretically, a proper No.9. If you look at Chelsea with [Romelu] Lukaku, Chelsea and Man City contested the Champions League final [in 2021] without a No.9. They proved that they are the best teams in Europe without a No.9, and then one team gets one and all of a sudden their season falls apart. ‚ÄúIn Haaland, if Man City are going to change the way they play for one player, then arguably you would end up with a different outcome. I don‚Äôt think Haaland is necessarily going to go straight in there as a No.9, and therefore do Liverpool need to match up? Well, City didn‚Äôt beat Liverpool this season. Liverpool lost the title by one point and goal difference. ‚ÄúThe irony of all of this is that Liverpool have only lost three games all season. What‚Äôs the issue here? It sounds obvious but they need to win more games than drawing them, as opposed to City losing more games. Is that down to not scoring enough goals or is it down to conceding too many? Weirdly, they won the Golden Boot and Golden Glove, so they are ticking both boxes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they need to go out and look for another Haaland. The model that Klopp and Liverpool have got as a club is proving itself this season. You can only imagine that next season will be the same. I don‚Äôt think they need to match City in the transfer market.‚Äù Questions have been asked of how much longer Firmino will be sticking around at Liverpool, while Salah and Mane are also working on contracts through to 2023 and are yet to agree extensions to those terms. Klopp also has the likes of Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz at his disposal, with a Portuguese forward proving that he can operate down the middle and deliver a healthy haul of goals, and James believes that the Reds will have a grand plan when it comes to forward-thinking transfer calls. A man that spent seven years at Anfield between 1992 and 1999 added: ‚ÄúThe Liverpool model with recruitment has been exceptional. The fact they haven‚Äôt brought in a No.9 to this point would suggest that the way they have recruited is to keep this fluidity. ‚ÄúWith Mo Salah, of all the players that Liverpool have got, he is the most stationary. Mane and Diaz can play in multiple roles, whereas Salah does play in that one role. They already have a stationary player, but the fluidity around that player is the key to Liverpool‚Äôs success. To have two stationary players, I think you are asking for trouble.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lewandowski-season-buy-him-liverpool-striker-transfer-talk/blt59b18eea4dca8384,Chris Burton,9cca05b8-6014-45c5-9e9d-5532fe7b1fc1
"RB Leipzig vs Bayern Munich: Predictions, tips & betting odds","RB Leipzig face Bayern Munich in the German Super Cup on Saturday evening as the Bavarians aim to continue their domestic dominance. As well as winning each of the last 10 Bundesliga titles, Bayern have lifted the Super Cup trophy in five of the last six years and are favourites to triumph once more against the holders of the German cup. With the game being played at the Red Bull Arena, Leipzig have home advantage although they remain clear outsiders at 14/5 (3.80) to win in 90 minutes with bet365. There is no extra time in the German Super Cup with the match going straight to penalties if it ends as a draw and a stalemate is priced at 11/4 (3.75). Bayern have won each of the last three Bundesliga meetings between these two sides and another success for Julian Nagelsmann's side is offered at 10/11 (1.91). First goal scorer markets are not available for this game. The last four clashes between these two sides have brought 21 goals and while Bayern have enjoyed plenty of success in this fixture, Leipzig have been capable of competing with the country's biggest side. Leipzig have netted in four of their last six matches against their Bavarian rivals and while they are clear outsiders for the game, there could be some value in backing the hosts to at least get on the score sheet. Leipzig averaged over two goals scored per game in the Bundesliga last term, finding the back of the net in both matches against Bayern and backing goals at both ends on Saturday looks like a strong selection. Both teams to score is evidently a highly fancied selection given it is priced at 4/9 (1.44), odds that will attract few investors for a standalone bet. However, combining this bet with a Bayern win sees the odds rise to an appealing 21/10 (3.10). Sky Sports will broadcast coverage of the weekend's German Super Cup, as well as several Bundesliga fixtures throughout the course of the 2022/23 season.

Tuchel handed suspended one-match ban while Conte avoids suspension after clash following Chelsea's draw with Tottenham,"Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte have been fined by the Football Association (FA) for their conduct during the 2-2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham last week. The Blues boss has also been banned for one game, though that punishment has been suspended for the time being. The two managers clashed more than once during the London derby at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Once on the touchline after Tottenham's first goal and then again when they shook hands after the match, resulting in both being shown red cards. The FA has handed out fines to the duo, though they may appeal against the punishments. ""An independent Regulatory Commission has today ordered that Thomas Tuchel be fined ¬£35,000 and banned from the touchline for one match, and Antonio Conte be fined ¬£15,000 after they respectively breached FA Rule E3,"" a statement read.  pic.twitter.com/OIK8PTfZfj ""Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte admitted that their behaviour after the final whistle of the Premier League game between Chelsea FC and Tottenham Hotspur FC on Sunday 14 August 2022 was improper, and both managers requested a paper hearing.""  The statement added: ""These sanctions are subject to appeal, and Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs one match touchline ban has been suspended temporarily pending the independent Regulatory Commission‚Äôs written reasons for its decisions that will be made available in due course."" Tuchel played down the significance of the incident after the match, saying in an interview with Sky Sports: ""It's emotional, football. We don't need to heat it up.  ""You have emotional coaches on the touchline and that's it. If we meet [later], we meet. If not, then not. Come on guys, it's between two competitors and nothing bad happened."" He then told¬†BBC Sport: ""It was hot from the temperature and hot between the benches and hot on the field and hot between the spectators - everything that you want and what you hope in a match like this early in the season.

Chelsea boss Tuchel unbowed on Azpilicueta desire as Barca move sits in limbo,"Thomas Tuchel admits he is reluctant to grant Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta's desire to depart for Barcelona, with the Blues boss stating that he has to prioritise the aims of his squad rather than individual players. The veteran defender has been outspoken in his desire to switch to Camp Nou this summer, following Andreas Christensen out of the door in making a move to the Blaugrana. The arrival of Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli in Chelsea's biggest purchase of the summer so far theoretically could pave the way for Azpilicueta to get his wish, but given how Tuchel still sees a role for the Spaniard at Stamford Bridge, the manager is reluctant to let him go. ""It's a tough question because I am not sure if I want to give Azpi what he wants,"" Tuchel said, admitting that was ""maybe a little bit"" irked by Barcelona's insistent pursuit. ""At some point it is about what we want. ""I just made the comparison about how much we fought for [Kalidou] Koulibaly, who is a national team player and roughly the same age. He is a hugely important player for Napoli but we have a Spanish international who is the captain at Chelsea. I see him maybe at the same level but Barcelona don‚Äôt see him on that level. ""So I am not sure if I want to give him what he wants as he is a huge player. We don't think so much about other clubs. The focus is on us and what we need. I said that to him and I say it to you that I understand on a personal and a career level. ""But I am not only in this role to give him what he wants. I am a manager for Chelsea who wants to do what's best for Chelsea. He doesn't like it but he understands. It is tough for him because the other club is permanently on him. On the first of September when things calm down, then he can play on his highest level."" Though reports suggest Chelsea could yet cave and allow the Spaniard to head to Camp Nou, Tuchel's comments suggest the Blues may refuse to fold, particularly if Barcelona are unable to stump up the cash wanted by the club. The Premier League outfit, despite being flush with financial clout following the Todd Boehly takeover, have no reason to accept a cut-price offer for one of their most influential players and a cornerstone of their success over the past half-decade. Conversely, questions will be raised about with Barca can take the bar any higher, with the club's well-documented financial issues - alleviated for now by a number of high-risk moves away from the pitch - already theoretically stretched by a double raid for Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-boss-tuchel-unbowed-on-azpilicueta-desire-as-barca/blt9ac344551c0c5f74,Andrew Steel,cf03994b-7aec-4b8e-a12d-6e61cfaf155d
Tuchel sets Chelsea finals record after guiding Blues to Carabao Cup showpiece,"Thomas Tuchel has become the first Chelsea manager to lead the club to the finals of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Champions League.

The Blues will face either Liverpool or Arsenal in the final, after reaching the Champions League and FA Cup finals last season. As he nears his one-year anniversary at the helm, Tuchel is already racking up an impressive list of accomplishments as Chelsea head coach.

Yarmolenko told former team-mate Tymoschuk to 'f*ck off' in row over Russia invasion of Ukraine,"Andriy Yarmolenko says he told his former Ukraine team-mate Anatoliy Tymoshchuk to ‚Äúf*ck off‚Äù as their friendship deteriorated following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Tymoshchuk has been criticised for not speaking out against Russia‚Äôs invasion, particularly as he is an assistant coach at Russian Premier League side Zenit St Petersburg. Yarmolenko, who played alongside Tymoshchuk for Ukraine for seven years, has now revealed details of a phone conversation between the pair, where he expressed his anger at the former midfielder‚Äôs stance. Speaking to Zorya Londonsk about his conversation with Tymoshchuk, Yarmolenko said: ‚ÄúI asked him how do you sleep at night. He replied 'I don‚Äôt sleep‚Äô. ‚ÄúThen he called me. I told him you used to be a role model for me, now you‚Äôre nothing. Then he told me to ‚Äòf*ck off‚Äô and I told him the same and that‚Äôs that.‚Äù Tymoshchuk is a footballing legend in Ukraine. He is the most capped player in the history of the national team, having appeared in 144 games at international level between 2000 and 2016. The former midfielder also captained his country for four years before retiring from playing in 2017 and has served as No 2 at Zenit for the past five seasons. His silence on the ongoing conflict has therefore angered many Ukrainians, particularly as several former and current national team players have already come forward to oppose the war, including Yarmolenko. The Ukraine FA has even called for the 42-year-old to be stripped of the club medals he won at Shakhtar Donetsk and all-state awards and honorary titles, accusing him of working ""for the club of the aggressor"".",https://www.goal.com/en/news/yarmolenko-tymoschuk-row-russia-invasion-ukraine/blt45fb675fc01f81b0,Tom Mallows,2d4f35c0-37b8-41cf-86f1-32baae4e044b
Barcelona press ahead with plans to sign AC Milan midfielder Kessie on free transfer,"Barcelona are pressing ahead with plans to capture Milan midfield Franck Kessie on a free transfer this summer, GOAL understands. The Ivory Coast international has spent the last five seasons with the Serie A giants, having played his entire professional career in Italy to date. But so far, the 25-year-old has failed to come to an agreement over new terms with Stefano Pioli's side, leaving Xavi's Barca ready to pounce and make a cut-price move for the playmaker. Kessie is looking to move on from San Siro after five years with the Rossoneri - and a move to a more ambitious Blaugrana outfit could well appeal to the Ivory Coast international. For Barca, it remains a further win for the cash-strapped club if they can convince him to sign, given their well-documented issues over the past year when it comes to financial matters, having seen them navigate the market with a slew of free transfers. But while Xavi eyes Kessie to play a different role than one currently within his squad, the Catalan outfit are also aware that Milan could yet table an improved offer despite Kessie having knocked back several rounds of fresh terms - and could be persuaded to prolong his career in Italy. Having made the move to Atalanta's youth ranks in 2014, the 25-year-old enjoyed a breakout season on loan with Cesena in Serie B across the 2015-16 term, before returning to La Dea for the following season. He spent just one year more with them in Bergamo however, before he was loaned out to Milan on a two-year deal with an obligation to buy in 2017. There, he truly helped make his name, emerging as a key player at San Siro while reaping further international selection with the Ivory Coast, including three AFCON selections and as a member of their squad at Tokyo 2020. a a",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-press-ahead-with-plans-to-sign-ac-milan-midfielder/blt5b1fb6d1301eb8f8,Adria Soldevila,57c048b5-7d00-41f5-93f8-219d4a0b513e

Loftus-Cheek: Chelsea want to get Liverpool back in FA Cup final,"Chelsea want to ""get back"" at Liverpool for their Carabao Cup final defeat, says Ruben Loftus-Cheek, after the Blues booked an FA Cup final rematch against the Reds with a semi-final victory over Crystal Palace. The midfielder opened the scoring in the second half at Wembley Stadium with his first club goal for three years, before Mason Mount doubled the lead for Thomas Tuchel's side to ensure a 2-0 win over a valliant Eagles team. For former Palace loanee Loftus-Cheek, the result is a sweet one - but with another shot at silverware against a quadruple-chasing Liverpool side now in their sights, he says the team are keen to exact their revenge on the biggest stage. ""We want to get them back, simple as that,"" Loftus-Cheek told ITV Sport after the full-time whistle. ""It was a fantastic game in the League Cup final and could have gone either way.""

Why did VAR rule out Benzema's goal for Real Madrid in Champions League final vs Liverpool?,"Karim Benzema briefly thought he had continued his stunning run in front of goal for Real Madrid in the Champions League before VAR brought his opening strike back for offside. The Frenchman converted one of the few chances to fall to the Merengue in a first half in which Liverpool held the upper hand. But he was deemed to have been in an illicit position when he struck, leaving the final deadlocked at 0-0 when the half-time whistle blew. The first half was in its final minutes when Benzema struck for what he thought was his 16th goal of the Champions League campaign. A mix-up in the Liverpool defence left the Frenchman with a chance from close-range and he converted with ease. Referee Clement Turpin, however, was quick to signal an offside, and VAR confirmed the decision. While the final touch prior to Benzema's finish appeared to come from Fabinho, it was ruled accidental, meaning that the forward was indeed offside.

Alternatively, you can take a commuter train to either Barra Funda or Agua Branca train stations. There are also numerous buses that pass by the stadium, which may be a faster option if you are coming from the Jardins area. The stadium was officially inaugurated on November 19, 2014, with a Brazilian Serie A match between hosts Palmeiras and Sport Recife, which ended 2-0 in favour of the visitors. Allianz Parque was built on the same site as Palmeiras' previous stadium, Estadio Palestra Italia, where they last played in July 2010, before it was demolished. Palmeiras announced a naming rights agreement with insurance firm Allianz in 2013, and then allowed fans to vote for their favourite name incorporating Allianz.

'I had doubts in my head' - Bayern Munich star Davies describes 'scary' heart diagnosis,"Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies admits that he feared his playing days were over after his heart condition diagnosis, with the Canada international keen to kick on now that he is back on the pitch. The Bundesliga star was sidelined after a bout with Covid-19 last term before developing myocarditis. Davies recovered to ultimately take part in Bayern's successful title charge, but he acknowledges that there was a period where he did not know if he would return to the pitch. ""That was very scary, especially [because] the doctors are saying that they don't know how long I was supposed to be out,"" Davies was quoted by ESPN. ""I think that was the most scariest part. ""At that time I had doubts in my head, whether I'm still going to be able to play football, but everything worked out at the end. I'm happy and I'm grateful for the doctor taking such good care of me. ""I'm happy that I can be back on the pitch.""

'He was never a midfielder' - Inside Liverpool star Fabinho's forgotten Real Madrid loan spell,"Looking back, it was some 'B' team. It had Alvaro Morata leading the line, with Jese Rodriguez buzzing around in support. Denis Cheryshev played off the left, with Lucas Vazquez flying down the opposite flank.¬† In the middle the likes of Omar Mascarell, Borja Garcia and a youngster named Casemiro ran the show, while Nacho and Diego Llorente kept things tight at the back.¬† Yep, Real Madrid Castilla‚Äôs class of 2012-13 were pretty special alright. Most of them have gone on to enjoy stellar careers across Europe.¬† And this weekend, in the final of the Champions League, the Spaniards will run into perhaps the best graduate of them all. Fabinho was just 18 when he first arrived in Madrid. He was a tall, skinny full-back who had been whisked away from Fluminense, his first club, before he had made a single first-team appearance. Rio Ave, a modest club in the north of Portugal, had signed him. Nuno Espirito Santo, the former Wolves and Tottenham boss, was their manager, while Jan Oblak and Ederson, now two of the world‚Äôs best goalkeepers, were in the squad, along with Bebe, once of Manchester United. The teenage Fabinho would train with them briefly, but would be moved on loan to Castilla almost immediately. It was all part of the grand plan of Jorge Mendes, the super-agent most commonly associated with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and, of course, Jose Mourinho. Mourinho was manager of Real Madrid at the time, and Ronaldo was his star man. Fabinho, meanwhile, arrived in the 'B' team with little fanfare. Unknown and untested, one of Mendes‚Äô many gambles.¬† Alberto Toril was the coach of Castilla that season, and remembers Fabinho fondly. ‚ÄúHe was very shy, but you could immediately see his potential as a player,‚Äù he tells¬†GOAL. ‚ÄúWhen he arrived, he occupied a somewhat strange position for the type of footballer he was. He was 1.90m (6ft 2in), but he was a right-back, which is unusual, no? ‚ÄúHe played on occasion as a centre-back, but never as a midfielder. At the time, he just wasn‚Äôt seen as a midfield player, although we were not sure where his best position would be in the future.‚Äù Fabinho would make 30 appearances for Castilla that season, and would be handed his senior Real debut by Mourinho late in the campaign. He played 14 minutes as a substitute against Malaga in May 2013, assisting Angel Di Maria for the final goal of a 6-2 win at Santiago Bernabeu.¬† ‚ÄúMourinho and his coaching staff had good regard for him,‚Äù Toril says. ‚ÄúThey always asked about his evolution and were very attentive to his¬†development. He was often involved in training with the first team.‚Äù Toril, who would later go on to manage Elche in the Spanish second division and now coaches Real's Femenino team, remembers being especially struck by Fabinho‚Äôs understanding of the game, as well as his personality and technical qualities. ‚ÄúHe was eager to learn,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHe was positionally very good and always made good decisions on the ball. You could see his confidence grow as the season went on.¬† ‚ÄúHis team-mates loved him. He fitted in well with great players like Morata, Nacho, Casemiro, Lucas Vazquez, Jese. They were very young players at that time, but very prepared. ‚ÄúWith Fabinho, we all saw that he had great conditions for the future. He played many games, and his behaviour was always of a good level. He was very consistent, attentive and generous. He played a lot of good games.‚Äù Castilla finished eighth in the Segunda Division that season, just ahead of a Barcelona B side which included the likes of Rafinha, Gerard Deulofeu, Sergi Roberto and Alex Grimaldo. They were the division‚Äôs top scorers with 80 goals, despite losing as many games (17) as they won. But while others from that side would get first-team chances ‚Äì Casemiro, Nacho and Vazquez are all still at the club ‚Äì Fabinho‚Äôs career would be made elsewhere. He joined Monaco in the summer of 2013, as Mendes began to load the Ligue 1 club with his clients, which included Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez, Joao Moutinho, Ricardo Carvalho and, later, Bernardo Silva. His development accelerated in France, though he was again seen predominantly as a full-back to begin with. It was only later, towards his mid-20s, that he emerged as a holding midfielder. He has since become one of the best in the business. ‚ÄúHis evolution has been extraordinary,‚Äù Toril says. ‚ÄúHe was always in great condition but he was young and had to evolve. ‚ÄúWhen he played for Castilla, Casemiro played in that position, so he had to go elsewhere to develop and evolve. ‚ÄúHe is a top-class player. He has a great physical capacity, and uses that so well on the field. He is so good in possession, he always makes good decisions with just a few touches of the ball.¬† ‚ÄúTactically, he is a very interesting player, always well positioned, very competitive and with a winning mentality. He was a pleasure to coach.‚Äù Fabinho, of course, arrived at Liverpool in the immediate aftermath of their last Champions League final with Real Madrid,¬†joining from Monaco for ¬£40 million ($52m)¬†within 48 hours of the Reds‚Äô defeat in Kyiv in 2018. Since then, he has become a European, World and Premier League champion with Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side, establishing himself as one of the world‚Äôs premier midfield players in the process. He has shaken off a hamstring injury to feature in Paris this weekend, and is likely to be a key player as Liverpool look to win their seventh European Cup.

Aboutrika calls on Al Ahly to withdraw from Caf Champions League after reaching final,"Despite reaching the final of the Caf Champions League for the third season in a row, Egypt legend Mohamed Aboutrika has called on Al Ahly to withdraw from the competition in order ‚Äúto preserve their position and prestige against the injustice from Caf.‚Äù The North African giants reached another final on Saturday after registering a 6-2 aggregate result over ES Setif of Algeria.

"Mourinho, Klopp, Guardiola & the Premier League managers that have thrown their players under the bus","Despite what they might say in the confines of a dressing room, managers will seldom shame their players in the public domain. Although, that isn't to say that they are totally exempt from criticism in press conferences and interviews, especially when the man in the technical area is at risk of losing his job. The pressure faced by managers can sometimes lead to them airing their dirty laundry in public, but it very rarely ends well as supporters are left to pick sides between players and their boss. Steven Gerrard made the mistake of replacing fans' favourite Tyrone Mings in the role of captain at Aston Villa whilst simultaneously questioning his mentality. The Villa boss soon restored the England centre-back to his starting XI after his public shaming didn't go down too well with those in the stands. With that incident fresh in the memory, here are a collection of other scenarios where players have been publicly thrown under the bus by their managers.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/mourinho-klopp-guardiola-premier-league-managers-thrown/blt225bccfbecb92dcb,Ed Mackey,86776e74-e5e4-47ef-9285-3ae0657b3eed
"Huddersfield vs Luton: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Huddersfield and Luton battle it out for a place in the Championship play-off final when they meet on Monday evening. The two teams played out a 1-1 draw in the first leg of the tie on Friday. At 6/5 (2.2) with bet365 to claim victory, Huddersfield are slight favourites to win the second leg of the tie. Luton can be backed at 13/5 (3.6) and the draw is set at 9/4 (3.25). Huddersfield star Jordan Rhodes is priced at 11/2 (6.5), while team-mate Fraizer Campbell is 6/1 (7.0). Luton's Elijah Adebayo is 15/2 (8.5) to break the deadlock. Huddersfield stretched their unbeaten run to eight matches by holding Luton to a draw on Friday. They have some injury problems to deal with, however, as Ryan Schofield, Matty Pearson and Alex Vallejo may all miss the match, but Sorba Thomas is fit enough to feature. Luton are still in with a chance of making it to the Premier League for the first time in their history, but are dealing with an injury crisis.  Their fitness concerns grew worse on Friday when Henri Lansbury sustained a knock in the first leg, while Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, Fred Onyedinma, Luke Berry, James Shea, Gabriel Osho and Jed Steer are all out. There have been under 2.5 goals in the three matches between these teams and in seven of Luton's last eight matches, which is priced at 4/7 (1.57) to come through again this week.

"What is the Panenka? Penalty kick technique, how to do it & players who used it after Hakimi's World Cup heroics","The Panenka is an ingenious but simple way of taking a penalty kick, which sees the taker chip the ball down the centre of the goal. Achraf Hakimi successfully executed an outrageous panenka to help Morocco secure a historic quarter-final berth with a penalty shoot-out victory against Spain at the 2022 World Cup. Karim Benzema made headlines in the 2021-22 Champions League semi-final as he pulled off a Panenka penalty in a high-pressure situation to score Real Madrid's third goal in their 4-3 first-leg defeat to Manchester City. So what is the Panenka penalty and who else has tried it? GOAL takes a look! The Panenka was invented by Antonin Panenka and shot to fame in 1976, when the Czechoslovakian star used it to outfox legendary Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Sepp Maier during the European Championship final. The Czechs had squandered a 2-0 lead during 90 minutes of that encounter and were forced into extra-time and subsequently penalties. After the first seven kicks were scored, Uli Hoeness missed for the Germans, giving Panenka the opportunity to win the tournament. The following seconds, which saw Maier dive off to his left as the ball simply floated into the middle of the goal, would go down in footballing history as the birth of a new skill, a revolutionary manner from which to score from 12 years. Pele described it as the work of ‚Äúeither a genius or a madman‚Äù, while the Czech has been forced to defend himself from accusations of showboating on one of the game‚Äôs biggest stages. ‚ÄúI suspect that Maier doesn‚Äôt like the sound of my name too much. I never wished to make him look ridiculous,‚Äù Panenka told UEFA.com. ‚ÄúOn the contrary, I chose the penalty because I saw and realised it was the easiest and simplest recipe for scoring a goal. It is a simple recipe.‚Äù Since the skill was first performed back in 1976, it has been used with increasing regularity by some of the game‚Äôs greatest players in some of the biggest moments. Perhaps the most famous Panenka came in the World Cup final of 2006, when Zinedine Zidane gave France a 1-0 lead over Italy by lifting such a penalty into the goal of Gianluigi Buffon. Of course, the match ended in disappointment for Zizou as he was sent off and France lost via a shootout, but it remains a moment etched in the folklore of the game. Andrea Pirlo is another to have successfully used the penalty, with the Italy great notably converting during a Euro 2012 shootout against England. ‚ÄúI made my decision right at the last second, when I saw Joe Hart, the England goalie, doing all sorts on his line,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAs I began my run up, I still hadn‚Äôt decided what I was going to do. And then he moved and my mind was made up. It was all impromptu, not premeditated. The only way I could see pushing my chances of scoring close to 100%.‚Äù In the modern game, Barcelona ace Lionel Messi has pulled the skill off on numerous occasions, while Eden Hazard, Memphis Depay and Raheem Sterling have all used the technique but the man himself seems to prefer those taken by Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos. ¬† ‚ÄúRamos is undoubtedly one of the best in the world,‚Äù he told  AS  the day after the centre-back had clipped home an effort against Celta in La Liga. ‚ÄúI remember that the first ones he took were not the prettiest ones, but all have gone in, and that is the important thing in the end. ‚ÄúThe kick was one of the most elegantly executed Panenka penalties I've ever seen him do. I really enjoyed it and I appreciated it. A great goal, without a doubt.‚Äù Ramos' former Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema has also pulled off a perfect Panenka, with the striker showing nerves of steel to deceive Ederson and pull the Blancos back to a 4-3 scoreline against Manchester City in the first leg of their 2021-22 Champions League semi-final tie.  Sebastian Abreu is possibly the most prolific taker of such kicks, but given that he is nicknamed ‚ÄòEl Loco‚Äô, that is to be expected. It is a not a tag that he necessarily appreciates, though. After netting in the 2014 World Cup for Uruguay against Ghana in a shootout using the method, he said: ‚ÄúWhat adjective did you use to describe Zidane‚Äôs penalty? Crazy? No, magic. So why not Abreu?‚Äù He can even claim to have scored two Panenkas in one game, doing so twice as Botafoga came back to beat Fluminense 3-2 away from home in 2011. Of course, the nature of the technique and the high-pressure situations in which it is often used makes it a risky option and not all have been as fortunate as Ramos to see their shots find the net. ‚ÄúI was watching Memphis Depay score one yesterday and decided at the last moment. I am stupid!‚Äù Aleksandar Mitrovic lamented as putting too much elevation on his chip during an international between his Serbia side and Montenegro. Gary Lineker also famously fluffed an effort in a 1992 friendly for England against Brazil, missing his opportunity to equal the goal-scoring record for his nation as he scuffed his effort, which resulted in a straightforward save. Perhaps the costliest failed attempt, though, came from Frenchman Yann Kermorgant while playing for Leicester in a 2010 play-off semi-final against Cardiff, which could have seen the Foxes promoted to the Premier League. He did not get enough height or power on his effort, which resulted in an easy save for Bluebirds keeper David Marshall. As the whole technique is based upon the assumption that the goalkeeper will dive to one corner or another, disguise is crucial to making a successful conversion. It is, therefore, important that there is no difference between your usual run up and the one you use when taking a Panenka. Only when the ball is struck should the difference become evident. Try striking the ball with the area of your boot roughly where the inside of your big toe is. It can also help to keep a straight leg when trying the technique and it is important to lean back slightly ‚Äì but not too much ‚Äì to get elevation on the shot. Staying relaxed is important, which makes the execution of the kick on a bigger stage all the more impressive. Remember, like everything, practice makes perfect and this tricky skill should come to you in time.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-the-panenka-penalty-kick-technique-how-to-do-it/1esy8dk0ur6x31r1t4g1j6bzsi,Robin Bairner,a6869f53-fe34-473d-9a9d-a3feb0542aff
Man Utd-linked Osimhen reveals stance on his future,"Manchester United-linked striker Victor Osimhen has revealed his stance on his future, while hailing Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti as ""a very high-level coach"". Napoli initially signed Osimhen from Lille in July 2020, forking out a club-record fee of ‚Ç¨70 million (¬£60m/$73m) to secure the services of one of the highest-rated young forwards in Europe. The 23-year-old has hit 27 goals in his first 60 outings for the Italian outfit, reportedly attracting attention from United in the process. Osimhen has also been linked with Arsenal and Newcastle, but he remains under contract at Diego Armando Maradona Stadium until 2025. Spalletti's continued presence at Napoli will likely ensure that the Nigerian stays put, as he believes he has taken his game to new heights thanks to the Italian tactician's man-management skills. ""I have to thank Spalletti so much,"" Osimhen has told Radio Kiss Kiss. ""He helped me a lot in my growth as a footballer from many points of view, and I have to thank him and his staff for helping me score all these goals. They helped me improve my movement. ""He always talks to me after training and trains me both with and without the ball. I know I'm dealing with a very high-level coach, really. It is a great honour and a real pleasure to be trained by him, and I hope to be able to work with him for many more years."" Osihmen further indicated that he is set to remain at Napoli beyond the summer when discussing their 2021-22 campaign, which has seen the club secure a top-four finish but ultimately fall short of Serie A glory. The Nigeria international has vowed that Napoli will come back for the Scudetto with even more determination next season, as he added: ""It is a great honour for me to have achieved this goal [qualifying for the Champions League] with my team-mates. We are very happy to be able to measure ourselves in the biggest European club competition. ""We are more disappointed than [the fans] for not having [won the title]. We are, because we had the quality to win it. It was our dream to win it. Of course, our hope remains to win the title and for this, we will give everything next season to try again.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-linked-osimhen-reveals-stance-on-his-future/bltec52414f40ba5154,James Westwood,764795e1-3d9f-48e9-8fea-11771ae79eed

Whether you're battling it out to win your mini-league or attempting to avoid the embarrassment of finishing bottom, GOAL's guide aims to give you all the team news and tips you need ahead of the final day.

Manchester City, who will be guaranteed the title if they beat Wolves, could welcome back both Kyle Walker (¬£5.4m) and John Stones (¬£5.2m) after both returned to training on May 19, although Ruben Dias (¬£6.2m) is expected to miss out once again. Ralf Rangnick hasn't given any clues as to his final Manchester United line-up, however, with the Red Devils' interim boss insisting that decisions will be made after Saturday's training session. There has been a fitness concern over Harry Kane (¬£12.5m), meanwhile, with the Tottenham striker having pulled out of a media event due to feeling unwell but Antonio Conte has said that he expects him to be available for the meeting with Norwich. Rob Holding (¬£4.1m) has served his one-match ban and is available again for Arsenal, while Mason Mount (¬£7.7m) and Kai Havertz (¬£7.9m) should both come back into Chelsea's starting XI after being left on the bench for the 1-1 draw with Leicester City.

Despite Jurgen Klopp warning that he may only make the bench, expect the Liverpool star to feature from the start against Wolves as he looks to potentially fire the Reds to title glory. If the mere mention of ""bench"" is enough to put you off selecting Salah, then Heung-Min Son (¬£11.2m), who is one behind the Egyptian in the top scorer race, is your man, with Tottenham taking on bottom of the table Norwich. Available at just ¬£4.3m, Sessegnon is an absolute bargain and is almost certain to keep his place in the Spurs starting XI for their trip to Norwich, with Sergio Reguilon, having been out for so long, unlikely to come straight back in despite having returned to training. While Liverpool have a Champions League final meeting with Real Madrid to think about, you can be certain that all their focus will be on beating Wolves and making sure they get the job done, in case Manchester City do what is unlikely and slip up at Aston Villa For that reason, Mane should be a nailed on starter at Anfield, looking to add to the 174 points he's earned so far. Pep Guardiola is likely to make changes to his starting XI after the 2-2 draw with West Ham and, having not featured against the Hammers, Foden is likely to come back in as City look to secure the title against Aston Villa. Owned by just 7.4% of FPL bosses at the time of writing, the England international rarely misses City's biggest games of the season - this clearly being one of them - so expect him to start on Sunday.

Liverpool condemn 'vile and abhorrent' Hillsborough chants,"Liverpool have released a statement condemning the ‚Äúvile‚Äù and ‚Äúabhorrent‚Äù chants about the Hillsborough disaster in recent matches. Offensive chants referring to the 1989 disaster could be heard from a few Manchester United fans in the away section at Anfield during Tuesday‚Äôs Premier League game, with the Red Devils quickly releasing a statement condemning the actions of a section of the supporters. Three days earlier some Manchester City fans continued to chant during a minute‚Äôs silence in honour of the 97 victims before the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, forcing the referee to cut the tribute short. In a statement on the club‚Äôs website, Liverpool said: ‚ÄúLiverpool FC is saddened by the recent rise in vile chants about the Hillsborough disaster. ‚ÄúWe know the impact these abhorrent slurs have on the families of the 97, those who survived, and all associated with this club. ‚ÄúWe are working with the relevant authorities to do our utmost to ensure these chants are eradicated from football altogether and, where appropriate, bring the full force of the law and the game‚Äôs sanction process down on those who continue to sing them.‚Äù Both Manchester City and Manchester United released swift statements condemning the actions of some of their supporters and expressing solidarity with Liverpool. City apologised to the Reds and said they were ‚Äúextremely disappointed‚Äù with the actions of some of their fans. Manchester United said offensive chants about the disaster were ‚Äúcompletely unacceptable‚Äù and said it would ‚Äúeducate‚Äù fans about the issue.

When Zinedine Zidane became a superstar,"This article was first published in MUNDIAL. Football is an industry both fuelled and documented by famous quotes. Yet even in this age of misinformation, it‚Äôs still surprising how some of its most memorable lines have been wilfully reinterpreted or were wholesale fabrications from the beginning. Once they‚Äôre out there, woven into the game‚Äôs rich tapestry, our human nature can‚Äôt help but open us up to the possibility of belief. ‚ÄúSomething magical happens once it‚Äôs put down on paper,‚Äù Eugene Jerome said of the written word in Biloxi Blues. ‚ÄúThey figure no one would have gone to the trouble of writing it down if it wasn‚Äôt true.‚Äù One such quote has been attached to its attributed source like a faithful dog since 1995, becoming the catch-all reference that highlights the insularity of English football. Blackburn Rovers were the champions of England, with Kenny Dalglish making provisional plans to bolster their squad in defence of their title. He approached his chairman Jack Walker with a request to sign a gifted but relatively unknown midfielder from France, available for buttons if Blackburn moved quickly. Walker dismissed the idea, with a riposte that‚Äôs veracity has been open to debate ever since. ‚ÄúWhy do you want to sign Zidane,‚Äù he allegedly told Dalglish, ‚Äúwhen we have Tim Sherwood?‚Äù Doubts about Zinedine Zidane in his formative years weren‚Äôt solely confined to people in England who hadn‚Äôt seen him. The pantheon of the greatest players the game has seen is littered with those who were teenage prodigies, and few of the true greats blossomed as late as Zidane.¬† It was the scout Jean Varraud that took him off the tough La Castellane council estate in Marseille‚Äôs 15th arrondissement for a six-week trial with AS Cannes when he was 15. Zidane did enough to get signed as a professional and made his full debut a year later in 1989, an appearance that earned him a tasty bonus of 5,000 francs. While the club was trying to incentivise Zidane into unleashing the full array of his talent, they also needed him to fill out his wiry teenage frame. That would take a little time. ‚ÄúAt 18, he wasn‚Äôt the great Zidane, no,‚Äù recalled his Cannes team-mate Luis Fernandez, a former cornerstone of France‚Äôs Carre Magique in the 1980s. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt strong physically, but technically he was superb. ""He had sublime skill, a superb touch, and all the moves. On a technical level, he was much more advanced than the rest of the team.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt until Boro Primorac took over as manager in 1990 that Cannes started to put their faith in that ability. Zidane became a regular under him in the 1990‚Äì91 season, establishing a place in midfield alongside Fernandez. His first goal in professional football, a deft lob against Nantes, was rewarded with a gift of a new Renault Clio from the club President. It was one performance that season in particular that hinted at what would eventually follow when Zidane stood out as Cannes beat French champions Marseille 1‚Äì0 in the Stade V√©lodrome. He had been a huge boyhood fan of his local side and had been regularly heading back to watch them play after leaving the city. Cannes finished fourth in Ligue 1 in 1990‚Äì91, earning a UEFA Cup spot and the club‚Äôs first ever games in European competition. It was an adventure that came at a cost. Cannes were knocked out in the third round the following year, during which Zidane had to fulfil his military service. The European distraction contributed to a disastrous season for Cannes, who finished 19th in the table and were relegated. The expectation that summer was that their most saleable asset would be offloaded to Marseille, the incumbent French champions and the team Zidane had always supported, but the homecoming never materialised. Marseille‚Äôs coach, Raymond Goethals, passed on Zidane because he was ‚Äútoo slow‚Äù. Instead, Zidane hopped on an elevator going in the opposite direction to Cannes. FC Girondins de Bordeaux had been a dominant force in French football in the mid-80s, winning three championships in four seasons, before a financial scandal overwhelmed the club and saw them automatically relegated to Ligue 2 in 1991. Now, they were back after winning promotion at the first attempt and had already plundered the demoted Cannes squad for Eric Guerit and Jean-Francois Daniel. When Marseille unexpectedly baulked at signing Zidane, Bordeaux coach Rolland Courbis took a low-priced punt on him instead.¬†¬†¬† Courbis was also from Marseille and formed a paternalistic bond with his new player that smoothed the transition into life in the French south-west. While Zidane‚Äôs family and friends referred to him by his middle name of Yazid, it was Courbis that coined the nickname that would become famous ‚Äì Zizou. Bordeaux quickly realised that they had a serious talent on their hands, albeit a sensitive one. Zidane cut a broodingly intense figure, who took in the world with the deep, piercing eyes of a people watcher. Coaxing him out of that shell was a long-term project. ‚ÄúHe was a player who appeared an introvert,‚Äù said Bordeaux‚Äôs technical coach Pierrot Labat. ‚ÄúIn fact, he doubted himself. I attempted to instil confidence into him. ""It was one of the first times ‚Äì the first time in fact ‚Äì that I applied psychology in order to provide him with the self-belief that allowed him to produce his full potential.‚Äù The scope of that potential was huge. Zidane possessed an astonishing repertoire of close-quarter skills. Drag-backs, Cruyff turns, stepovers, back heels, [i]roulette‚Äôs[i], and nutmegs could all be deployed at will, with a featherlight sense of touch and timing. He was also deceptively quick‚Äîdeceptive enough for Goethals to miss it, certainly‚Äîand his balance when in possession or running with the ball was freakish given his stature. At Bordeaux, his frame completed its journey from gangly adolescence to manhood.¬† ‚ÄúSix foot two (1.88 metres), Zidane...‚Äù recalled Jonathan Woodgate of clapping eyes on him at Real Madrid. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw him. I was like ‚Äòhow big are you?‚Äô Because I didn‚Äôt think that. ""His style across the pitch and the way that he moved, he was on a different level from anyone I‚Äôve ever played with, but really slim. Twelve and a half stone (85kg), maybe, tops.‚Äù Confidence slowly started to course through that body. A higher calibre of team-mate also helped, for his sense of belonging as well as his development as a player. In his first season, Zidane struck up an instant, almost telepathic relationship with striker Christophe Dugarry‚Äîalong with marauding fullback Bixente Lizarazu, they formed the bedrock of the team. The club finished fourth in Ligue 1 in 1992‚Äì93 and again in 1993‚Äì94. At the end of the latter season, aged 22, Zidane was given the ‚ÄòBest Hope‚Äô award as the most promising young player in France. That prompted a call-up to the national team, but only as a replacement. The French coach Aim√© Jacquet was trying to build a new side out of the wreckage of the squad that had failed to qualify for that summer‚Äôs World Cup. It was a pressing concern, with France hosting the next one. On August 17, 1994, they played the Czech Republic in a friendly in Bordeaux. When Youri Djorkaeff pulled out of the squad, local boy Zidane was called up to take his place but only made the bench. Jacquet‚Äôs reservations about Zidane were not just down to self-belief, but also self-indulgence. ‚ÄúZidane was out of the ordinary‚Äîexceptional‚Äîbut he didn‚Äôt have his influence yet,‚Äù said Jacquet. ‚ÄúHe hadn‚Äôt yet got his personal aura. He played football to enjoy himself; he had exceptional skills, though he wasn‚Äôt much of a team player. ""But when he came into the French squad, he joined other talents, who took him on to an international level.‚Äù At the Parc Lescure that night, Zidane took it on himself to level up an international. France were two goals behind when Zidane replaced the Auxerre playmaker Corentin Martins in the 63rd minute. With the game drifting towards full time, Laurent Blanc sent a long, sweeping low pass to Zidane, who let the pace of the ball beat the lunging challenge of his marker. He then went through the Czech defence with an ease that was almost contemptuous. A quick stepover left Lubos Kubik in his wake before he shuffled the ball quickly between his feet to avoid an attempted tackle by Tomas Repka. From 25 yards out, Zidane then lashed a left-footed drive past Petr Kouba into the far corner.¬† It would‚Äôve been a stunning goal at any stage of a career, let alone an international debut, and he wasn‚Äôt even done. Three minutes later, it was 2‚Äì2. In a precursor to the greatest night in the history of French football, Zidane powered in a near-post header from a corner. The Parc Lescure erupted, and France had blagged the unlikeliest of draws. As the camera cut to the coaching staff on the France bench, it caught a wonderful moment, as they all smiled incredulously and processed a uniform realisation: we‚Äôve got one here. In the television interview afterwards, Zidane said it was the first time at either youth or professional level where he‚Äôd scored twice in a game. ""I think of my wife, who is just two months pregnant,"" he added. ""I dedicate my match and my two goals to her."" Enzo, named after the Marseille and Uruguay great Enzo Francescoli, would enter the world the following spring. Another gestation was underway; Zidane was on a path to becoming the fulcrum of France‚Äôs new team. Martins had been one contender for that role but played just five more times for France thereafter. Manchester United‚Äôs Double-winning inspiration Eric Cantona was the incumbent and had thrown his hands in the air when the equaliser went in. He‚Äôd effectively just celebrated a future that didn‚Äôt have him in it. Zidane needed to take his game to a different level with Bordeaux to keep his development accelerating. In 1994‚Äì95, they were eliminated from the UEFA Cup in the second round by GKS Katowice and finished seventh in Ligue 1, just outside the automatic qualifying places to re-enter the competition. Fortune, however, had chucked Bordeaux a bone, as that year UEFA had decided to assume control of a quirky summer competition based in Central Europe.¬†¬† The Intertoto Cup was marketed as ‚ÄòThe Cup for the Cupless‚Äô. It was sold to the lower-ranking teams in less fashionable European leagues who hadn‚Äôt qualified for UEFA‚Äôs three main tournaments as a rare chance to play in a competitive continental competition. The real reason for its existence was so that betting companies in the region could keep football pools running over the summer. UEFA initially distanced itself from the competition and refused to organise it due to its origins in the vice of gambling, but eventually took the reins in 1995. Sixty teams entered the tournament, which would have group stages followed by knockout rounds, with two separate finals and thus two champions. There was an added boon for both winners: they would both qualify automatically for the UEFA Cup the following season. Bordeaux entered the 1995 Intertoto Cup, which kicked off on 1 July. They breezed through their group unbeaten after victories over Norrkoping, Bohemians, and Odense BK, followed by a draw with HJK Helsinki which Zidane missed due to international duty. He returned for the quarter and semi-finals, in which Bordeaux brushed aside Eintracht Frankfurt and then Heerenveen at the Parc Lescure. On the way to the final, Zidane scored four times, two of which were free kicks ‚Äì he had now mastered the art of fizzing the ball up and over the wall at speed.¬† Bordeaux‚Äôs Intertoto Cup Final showcased another side of his complex character. Zidane had already been dismissed once in his career, when he thumped Marcel Desailly as retribution for a stray elbow, in a game between Bordeaux and Marseille in September 1993. Although Bordeaux would beat Karlsruher SC 4‚Äì2 in the two-legged final to win their Intertoto Cup section, the second leg was marred by Zidane‚Äôs red card in the 24th minute. The German team had been flying into a few tackles from the outset, and when Thorsten Fink had a nibble at his ankles, Zidane dropped him with a flailing arm to the chin, right in front of the referee. Beneath Zidane‚Äôs shyness lay dormant a volatile temper that could go off at any moment. He received 14 red cards in his career, most of which were born of retaliation. When Zidane kicked back, he hit hard. For his dismissal against Karlsruher SC, Zidane received a three-match European ban, during which his team-mates did the grunt work in getting Bordeaux past Vardar of Malta and Rotor Volgograd in the first two rounds of the UEFA Cup. Zidane‚Äôs focus in the autumn of 1995 instead switched to his national side, as the anger management issues of one of his international colleagues had created an opportunity within the France team.¬† Thanks to his acrobatic retribution at Selhurst Park in January 1995, Cantona was subsequently banned from all football for eight months. In his absence, Zidane took over as the creative hub of Jacquet‚Äôs team. Ten days after Cantona had returned against Liverpool at Old Trafford in October, Zidane inspired France to a 3‚Äì1 win over Romania in Bucharest. It was a vital win in qualifying France for Euro 96, and effectively the night France‚Äôs future World Cup-winning side was born. Even though Cantona was sensational for Manchester United in the remainder of the 1995‚Äì96 season, he was never called up by the national side again. Zidane‚Äôs roll continued into Bordeaux‚Äôs third round UEFA Cup tie against Real Betis at the end of the year. Even the miskicks were working in his favour. In a rain-soaked home leg, Zidane sliced a right-footed shot from the edge of the box so badly that it eventually landed at the feet of Daniel Dutuel on the other side of the penalty area. He drilled Bordeaux‚Äôs first in a 2‚Äì0 victory.¬† In the second leg, he caught one perfectly with his left. In just the third minute, Zidane silenced a fervent crowd at the Estadio Benito Villamar√≠n by walking on to a knockdown from a Bordeaux goal kick and launching a preposterous dipping volley over Betis goalkeeper Pedro from 40 yards out. MUNDIAL is a quarterly print magazine dedicated to reminding you why you love football. You can buy the next issue here. It took the wind right out of Betis. The home side came back to win 2‚Äì1, but Zidane had effectively finished the tie. For the quarter-finals the following spring, the standard of competition would go up several levels again. AC Milan were slumming it in the UEFA Cup. They had been in the final of the Champions League for the previous three seasons and would go on to win Serie A by eight points in the 1995‚Äì96 season. Bordeaux and the UEFA Cup were just a palette cleanser to be dispatched before they returned to the high table to swill champagne around their gums again. The French side had never won a tie against Italian opposition in Europe, and it was no surprise that they went down 2‚Äì0 in the San Siro in the first leg. In the return, the atmosphere at the Parc Lescure had all the anticipatory buzz of one of the great European nights, but it still looked the longest of shots. The team that Bordeaux would have to beat to progress was an absolute p*ss-take. Milan might have had reserve goalkeeper Mario Ielpo in nets, but the back four in front of him was Christian Panucci, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, and Paolo Maldini. The midfield that Zidane would have to negotiate contained some kid called Patrick Vieira, his national team-mate Desailly, Stefano Eranio, and Roberto Donadoni. Up front, there was George Weah and Roberto Baggio. Bordeaux had to combat this with the likes of journeyman striker Didier Tholot, the horizontally laid-back Dutch midfielder Richard Witschge, and Danish defender Jakob Friis-Hansen. But they also had Christophe Dugarry, the tireless Lizarazu, and the rising force of Zidane. That night, any self-doubt had evaporated. Minutes before kick-off, Canal Plus interviewed Zidane in the tunnel and asked if Bordeaux planned to shake them up. ‚ÄúFor sure,‚Äù Zidane replied. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the choice, in any case. We are starting behind, so that is what we will have to do to start the match, and by doing that we make them doubt themselves.‚Äù Throughout the interview, his thoughts‚Äîand his gaze‚Äîwere elsewhere. Mentally, Zidane was already on the Parc Lescure pitch. An early goal is usually key to most seemingly impossible second-leg comebacks, and with 15 minutes gone, Tholot slotted one in for Bordeaux after brilliant work from Lizarazu down the left. As the game progressed, one thing became clear: Zidane was bossing it. He had ascended. Everything we came to know him for was evident that night: the deft touches, the footwork, those understated flourishes that confirmed just who was in charge. ‚ÄúWhat he can do with his feet, some people can‚Äôt even do it with their hands,‚Äù Thierry Henry once said of him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just magical. Sometimes when he plays with the ball, it seems like he‚Äôs dancing.‚Äù Midway through the second half, Zidane laid on a goal for Dugarry with a free kick that took a fortuitous deflection off the side of the referee‚Äôs head. Bordeaux were level, and Milan were reeling. Six minutes after that, he teed up one of the most famous goals in Bordeaux‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs a cliche to talk of midfielders gliding across a pitch, but it has never been truer of anyone than Zidane. He could saunter through an opposing midfield with the grace of a speed skater circumventing a tight bend. Watching it now, it‚Äôs like a trailer for the 10 years that followed. Shortly after Zidane had nutmegged Desailly near halfway, he received the ball on the left wing and then cut diagonally through the heart of the Milan team. His attempted through ball to Tholot was blocked; when the rebound fell into his path, he prodded it to Dugarry, who bludgeoned the ball high into the net. The Parc Lescure utterly lost it. Bordeaux‚Äôs 3‚Äì2 aggregate victory passed instantly into legend. Buoyed by that result, they swiftly dealt with fellow romantic adventurists Slavia Prague in the semi-finals. More nimble footwork from Zidane set up Dugarry for the solitary winning goal in the Czech capital in the first leg, but disaster struck in the second. Both players were booked in the 1‚Äì0 home victory at the Parc Lescure and would miss the first leg of the final with Bayern Munich. Bordeaux‚Äôs European exertions were also causing problems in the league with the club struggling near the relegation zone. In February 1996, they sacked manager Slavo Muslin and replaced him with former boss Gernot Rohr. Bordeaux eventually finished 16th as the weight of an additional 20 European games on a small squad took its toll. With a grim sense of inevitability, Bayern made mincemeat out of Bordeaux in the final. They won the first leg 2‚Äì0 in Munich. When Zidane and Dugarry returned for the second, there was briefly the hope of a repeat of the Milan miracle. Zidane was menacing in the opening stages, but the game turned when the influential Lizarazu was nailed by a horrible challenge from Emil Kostadinov after half an hour and stretchered off. Bayern went ahead with a deflected goal early in the second half and, to rub salt in the stud wounds, Kostadinov soon nodded in a second. Bordeaux were gone. Bayern eventually ran out 3‚Äì1 winners on the night and 5‚Äì1 on aggregate to claim the UEFA Cup. It was a shattering defeat for Bordeaux after their Homeric run from the backwaters of the Intertoto Cup group phase all the way to one of the continent‚Äôs flagship finals. Zidane was voted Player of the Year in France and had the faith of the nation invested in him for the European Championship in England that summer. MUNDIAL is a quarterly print magazine dedicated to reminding you why you love football. You can buy the next issue here. France were tepid at Euro 96 ‚Äì Franz Beckenbauer called their football ""lily-livered"" ‚Äì and failed to score in the knockout rounds before the Czech Republic removed them on penalties in the semi-finals. To say the least, Zidane‚Äôs performance that day was leggy. Not only was it his 63rd game of a season that had lasted almost a full year, but he‚Äôd also been involved in a car crash just before the tournament that, despite not resulting in serious injury, is far from ideal.¬† Even if Walker‚Äôs misgivings about Zidane‚Äôs true worth in 1995 are apocryphal, similar doubts could be found in other parts of England at the time of Euro 96. The agent Barry Silkman claimed to have offered the chance to sign Zidane to the scouts at Newcastle United that summer, only to be told that they thought the player was overrated. Martin Edwards, then the Manchester United chairman, has since revealed that Alex Ferguson considered him at that time too, but didn‚Äôt think the transfer was worth the risk of upsetting Cantona‚Äôs position at the club.¬† Zidane‚Äôs rapidly realising potential may have been missed by the English audience, but the Italians knew all about it now. He joined the European champions Juventus for ¬£3.2 million ($4m) that summer. The next decade was Zidane‚Äôs, where he proved to be superior not just to Sherwood but every other footballer on the planet.¬† As a young boy, Zidane had been transfixed by Diego Maradona‚Äôs performance at the 1986 World Cup. Twenty years later, when the furore over Zidane‚Äôs red card in the World Cup Final in Berlin had eventually subsided, it became clear that he is the only player since Maradona to have imposed their personality so completely on the tournament. It took a bit of patience and encouragement, but the shy kid from Marseille eventually found the combination of ability and attitude required to become the most influential player in world football. The roots of that transformation can be traced back through France, along the Garonne River and to the Parc Lescure in Bordeaux.If you enjoyed this piece, why not follow Mike Gibbons here?

"Mino Raiola Mk II? Meet Rafaela Pimenta, the successor to football's super agent","Mino Raiola always had a talent for standing out in one way or another throughout his 54-year life.  Whether in one of his many family restaurants, where he was responsible for everything - from administrative tasks to entertaining the guests.  A constant guest at the time was Andre van Eerden, president of the second division club HFC Haarlem, whom Raiola constantly annoyed with his criticism of club policies and kept telling him how to do it right - until young Mino was hired as sporting director in his early 20s.  Of course, that was just the beginning of young Mino's career as a big figure in the football business. Later in many media-effective events as a long-established agent, he would command attention of the football world.  There are other consulting giants, like Jorge Mendes or Pini Zahavi, but Raiola always made the headlines.  Like Sir Alex Ferguson, with whom he negotiated a new contract for young Paul Pogba in 2012, who refused the legendary Scotsman's offer and told him: ""It's an offer that even my Chihuahuas wouldn't sign.""  Ferguson then publicly called Raiola a ""sucker"".  Various insults followed, but the Italian, who died on April 30, 2022, didn't really care what other people thought or said about him.  As long as he was able to assert the interests of his players, he accepted everything. Even when the cranky Scot denied his intelligence. Ultimately, Raiola didn't even care what his players thought of him, after all, they were just business partners, but most of his clients developed a very close relationship with him.¬†Raiola did not give a single player a consulting contract, instead a relationship of trust that was ultimately much stronger than any piece of paper. For Rafaela Pimenta, as a professor of law, that must have been quite daunting at first.¬† The lawyer knows that in the tough world of business, what counts in the end is what is written and signed on paper.¬†Especially when there is so much money in circulation and people are inclined to give up attributes like trust and promises for a few more bills. But she came to terms with it and went the Raiola way.¬†For more than 18 years, the Brazilian and the Italian worked side by side in an ever-growing consultancy empire.¬† Raiola was a suspicious guy who didn't let many people near him.¬†Only his cousin Vincenzo, a communications expert, a scout, a secretary and Rafaela work at¬†his agency¬†One, based in Monaco. And yet, for years, Raiola seemed like a one-man operation.¬†When he died, many people worried that his players would have to get through life without their consigliere.¬†It was almost touching how many seriously asked themselves what would become of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Erling Haaland and Co. Out of decency, no one should have approached the players yet, but there will certainly be some advisors who¬†want to help themselves pick off the¬†One empire.¬† However, the bounce rate will probably not be too high ‚Äì if at all.¬†It was only¬†after Raiola's death¬†that it became clear that it was not just a one-man operation and what a significant role Rafaela Pimenta, who is the only non-family person with shares in the company, played in the agency. She didn't even give rise to the suspicion that she was unable to act.¬†First she bagged Erling Haaland's move to Manchester City, then transferred Noussair Mazraoui and Ryan Gravenberch from Ajax to Bayern Munich and is currently working on the final details of Paul Pogba's return to Juventus.¬† Pimenta is an important person of trust for the latter.¬†In the new¬†Amazon¬†documentary ""The Pogmentary"", she plays an important role and may get real publicity for the first time. She can be seen in several sequences.¬†You can see Pogba always asking the Brazilian for advice - even when it's not about football.¬†When Pogba talks about Pimenta with his kids, she's ""Auntie Rafa"".¬†She is close to the family, but negotiators should not be fooled by her carefulness. In¬†The Athletic¬†, an unnamed sporting director at a Premier League club describes her as not only ""the most important person in football nobody knows"" but also ""the toughest negotiator in football"".¬†When she sits at the table, the lawyer comes out of her.¬†Connoisseurs say that Raiola got the clients, brought them together with the clubs, but Pimenta was the main player when it came to the contract details and worked on their counterparts down to the last detail. She doesn't know any different.¬†After studying at the University of Sao Paulo, Pimenta worked for former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.¬†She held an important position in the cartel office and was probably already notorious at the time for her rigorous approach. She was a passionate football player, but she got to know the business through contacts.¬†When Rivaldo and Cesar Sampaio founded a club called Guaratingueta in 1998, Pimenta stood by their side.¬†When a benefit game was organised as a result, a guest from Europe also came: Mino Raiola.¬†They got to know and appreciate each other and soon started working together.¬†They trusted each other and had their roles. Raiola was the public man who often wore his heart on his sleeve and tangled with many.¬†Even with his players, who knew what they had in him and therefore usually always remained loyal to him.¬† Only a few players who left Raiola were on record.¬†Romelu Lukaku is one of them, Borussia Monchengladbach star Marcus Thuram is said to have left the agency shortly before Raiola's death. Pimenta was the doer in the background.¬†Only what is allowed to penetrate gets through to the public.¬†There is not even reliable information about how old she really is and what her family situation is.¬†She doesn't need PR to do her job well. It is thanks to Raiola and Pimenta that they have had so much success.¬†It is only logical that she now takes on even more responsibility.¬† In the next few years, Raiola's sons, Mario and Gabriele, may also play a role within the empire.¬†They are said to have already gotten a taste of the business and will learn more about the business over the next few years.¬† Aunt Rafa will surely help him with that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mino-raiola-mk-ii-meet-rafaela-pimenta-the-successor-to-football-/blta6ec0517b00f2893,GOAL,4f6711e4-e57e-4a64-85fa-2848f838c6b5
Is Chelsea being sold? Abramovich ownership situation & potential new buyers explained,"It is no longer being denied that¬†Roman Abramovich is preparing to sell Chelsea Football Club after the threat of sanctions forces his hand through his association with Russian president Vladimir Putin.¬† Although Abramovich has yet to be sanctioned by the EU, UK, or United States, and insists that he hasn't done anything wrong, the oligarch is fearing a potential backlash due to the invasion of Ukraine.¬† Having previously denied the option of selling, the Blues now refuse to comment. As well as on the record comment, several¬†sources have told GOAL that they believe¬†Abramovich is preparing a total exit from the UK economy.¬† Chris Bryant MP, the Labour politician who has led the charge against the Blues' owner, gave insights into the situation on Tuesday: ""Roman Abramovich, well I think he‚Äôs terrified of being sanctioned, which is why he‚Äôs already going to sell his home tomorrow, and sell another flat as well. ""My anxiety is that we‚Äôre taking too long about these things."" With Abramovich's property up for sale, it was likely his club was too and it was confirmed on March 1 through Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss.¬† ""Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly,"" Wyss told the¬†Swiss newspaper Blick. ""I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich. I have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him ¬£2bn. But Chelsea has no money. As of today, we don‚Äôt know the exact selling price."" The asking price is said to be ¬£2.6 billion ($3.5bn)¬†which is significantly more than the ¬£300m ($400m)¬†that Abramovich originally bought it for. The price will cover the ¬£1.5bn ($2bn)¬†debt that the Russian has pumped into the west Londoners over the last 19 years. Swiss businessman Wyss believes that, even with his ¬£4.6bn ($6bn) net worth, Chelsea is too expensive and would look to buy the club as part of a consortium.¬† ""I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners,"" he said. ""But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say: I‚Äôm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then [it will be] with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors."" Wyss has now been revealed to be a part of a consortium that includes Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly. INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe considered buying the Blues in the past and has reportedly been linked with making an offer to buy the club.¬† However, his brother, Bob, has complained about the stadium, which needs redeveloping to compete with many of their Premier League rivals.¬† ""There was some early exchange but we were a significant way apart on valuations,"" Bob Ratcliffe told BBC Five Live. ""The issue with Chelsea is its stadium. We are all getting older and it is a decade of your life to resolve that."" Prospective new owners also wouldn't be able to own the pitch due to a fan ownership model, called the 'Chelsea Pitch Owners', retaining control of the turf itself.¬† Abramovich has owned Chelsea for almost 19 years and has claimed an incredible 21 trophies over his almost two-decade spell.¬† He was the first of a wave of wealthy individuals to pump their personal wealth into the sport, changing the status quo of domination from the traditional superpowers in the game.¬† Along with the likes of Manchester City, Newcastle United and Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea have been accused of sports washing, which accuses individuals of using sport to clean their reputation in the west.¬† #PMQs opened by @Keir_Starmer asking why Roman Abramovich isn't facing sanctions yet pic.twitter.com/lvH2e9BWAm",https://www.goal.com/en/news/is-chelsea-being-sold-abramovich-ownership-situation-new/blt5aa8928c7de21763,Nizaar Kinsella,e2812a3a-e139-44c3-b724-a1dcd718ccd3
Liverpool fail to secure ¬£8m transfer of Fulham's Fabio Carvalho,"Liverpool have failed in a deadline-day bid to sign Fulham teenager Fabio Carvalho.  The Reds had agreed a ¬£8 million ($11m) fee for the 19-year-old on Monday evening, and were prepared to allow him to remain at Craven Cottage until the end of the season.  But despite a day of negotiations, the clubs were unable to complete the necessary paperwork in time for the 11pm GMT deadline.  Carvalho had looked Anfield-bound when, after lengthy negotiations, a deal was struck between the clubs on deadline day.  A medical was hastily-arranged in London, and a five-year contract prepared.  But with Fulham insisting on a loan-back arrangement, Liverpool were unable to finalise all of the necessary paperwork.  The EFL, unlike the Premier League, does not permit ‚Äòdeal sheets‚Äô which would allow work to be continued after the deadline has passed, and Carvalho will now see out the remainder of his contract with the Cottagers. It remains to be seen whether Liverpool will return for him in the summer.  The Reds expect fierce competition to sign the England Under 18 international, which, along with their desire to avoid a lengthy compensation tribunal, was why they were keen to sign him this month.  It is understood that the likes of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea are among those interested, and Carvalho would be able to move to an overseas club for just a nominal compensation fee.  Liverpool are, however, expected to try and finalise a deal in the coming weeks, with Jurgen Klopp and his recruitment team believing he is a player of significant potential who would develop well on Merseyside.  The Reds have, at least, made one significant signing in January, landing Colombia star Luis Diaz from Porto in a ¬£50m ($67.5m) deal.  Meanwhile, Nat Phillips joined Bournemouth on loan on deadline day, while potential moves for Divock Origi and Takumi Minamino failed to materialise.

"Who will be Man Utd captain in 2022-23? Maguire, Ronaldo, De Gea & the armband contenders","Manchester United faced plenty of uncomfortable questions during the 2021-22 campaign, with more of the same lying in store for new boss Erik ten Hag as he looks to put his own stamp on an underperforming squad that has been inherited at Old Trafford. One of the many posers he needs to find answers to relates to the Red Devils' captaincy, with somebody needing to take the armband and fill the role of on-field leader for the Premier League side. Harry Maguire was handed that responsibility a matter of months after completing his record-setting ¬£80 million ($98m) transfer from Leicester in 2019, but the England international defender has struggled for form of late and could now be relieved of skipper duties. Maguire remains United captain for now, with Ten Hag yet to reveal if he will make a change. David de Gea and Bruno Fernandes have filled the armband for United at times over recent years, while five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Cristiano Ronaldo is an obvious option to provide inspiration to those around him. Ten Hag is not short on leadership qualities, with Maguire reluctant to step down from such a prominent position, and that should be considered a positive for a club that is desperately seeking to rediscover a lost spark. Quizzed on whether the Red Devils should be looking to take the captaincy off Maguire, former United defender Wes Brown ‚Äì who was speaking ahead of the 360 Sports TV Masters Cup - told GOAL: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good question. If it was me, I would want it back to show everyone and prove everyone wrong. ‚ÄúIt was a tough season for Harry, there were certain games where he didn‚Äôt play well. I think there were games where the team didn‚Äôt play well and ultimately, the manager and the captain have to take that ‚Äì that‚Äôs just how it goes. ‚ÄúI watched most of the games and, yes, there have been times when Harry could do better, but the trouble starts from before that ‚Äì there are three or four mistakes before that. ‚ÄúUltimately, Harry will have to take the stick because as defenders that is what happens. Harry will be determined to prove everybody wrong. He has got a good head on him, he is experienced. When your confidence does go, it takes a while to come back. 2022 has not been kind to Harry Maguire üò´ pic.twitter.com/Daj83TMkB2 ‚ÄúIf you talk about captaincy, I can only think of three people ‚Äì Harry, [David] de Gea and Cristiano [Ronaldo]. For the manager, I don‚Äôt think it will be a difficult one. I‚Äôm sure he will chat with all of them and when Harry talks to him, he will say that he‚Äôs absolutely fine with it and wants to prove everybody wrong. ‚ÄúUltimately it‚Äôs up to the manager and regardless of whether Harry is the captain, he has got the experience to be able to handle it. It‚Äôs a big season for him. Now we have to wait and see. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt play well every season, but the majority of people would. It would keep happening to individuals but you would never get pulled on it because the team is doing well. It‚Äôs about how you come back from it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, it is more difficult when people highlight and put pressure on you, but you do know you are at Manchester United, the standards are high, and that‚Äôs the be all and end all really ‚Äì you have to perform. When you are the captain of Manchester United, they are going to focus on you. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough. As captain, people go on like ‚Äòhe‚Äôs not like Roy Keane‚Äô ‚Äì who is! The game has changed, it‚Äôs not like that now. Everyone should be the captain, you all do your part. ‚ÄúFor Harry, it‚Äôs about focusing on getting a really good pre-season. If it was me, I would want to prove everybody wrong.‚Äù By James Robson ‚Äì Manchester United correspondent for GOAL How Ten Hag approaches the captaincy could say a lot about his managerial style. Sticking with Maguire is the easiest route to avoid upsetting a key player, who is also very popular in the dressing room. But perhaps Ten Hag needs to protect the centre-back at the same time as playing politics. He also needs to get Ronaldo onboard with his regime and convince the Portuguese legend that he is pivotal to his plans. Captain Cristiano ¬© pic.twitter.com/ZAKxMm2OOX Given the issues Maguire has just to get his form back on track, Ten Hag might do well to relieve him of the added pressures that come with being United‚Äôs skipper. It could be a temporary move - and sold to Maguire on those terms In the meantime, Ten Hag could turn to Ronaldo and try to convince him to lead a new era for United in the manner of Eric Cantona and the Class of ‚Äò92. It would appeal to Ronaldo‚Äôs ego and ensure he is fully focused in what is surely his final year at the club. Twelve months down the line, with Maguire hopefully over his crisis of form, he can take on the armband once more.

The 20 best football boots of all time: Where to buy Ronaldo's iconic Mercurial Superfly series and more,"There‚Äôs a lot that goes into a football boot design.

Then there‚Äôs the colours, whether you‚Äôre going for the all-time classic of black and white, or you want bright footwear to say something about the style of play. But when football boot design is great, it becomes much more than the sum of its parts. Suddenly, a boot becomes fused to a player in the public imagination.

‚ÄòThomas After Partey!‚Äô - Arsenal star meets lookalike and leaves Ghana team-mates in stitches,"Thomas Partey has had plenty to get excited about on the field this season, with the Arsenal and Ghana midfielder now running into a lookalike off it. The Gunners star is currently away with his country on World Cup qualifying duty, with a two-legged play-off clash being taken in with Nigeria. During preparations for those encounters, the 28-year-old has been rubbing shoulders with a doppelganger that has been jokingly dubbed ‚ÄúAfter Partey‚Äù. Partey‚Äôs international team-mate Daniel-Kofi Kyereh has posted a video on Instagram of the Arsenal star meeting an unknown man that bears a striking resemblance to one of the most famous faces in north London. Kyereh captained his post ‚ÄúThomas Partey & Thomas After Partey‚Äù, with all of those involved taking great delight in finding a slightly shorter replacement for a player that continues to star in the Premier League. Thomas Partey & Thomas After Partey ü§£ @Thomas Teye Partey #thomaspartey #ghana #blackstars #kofikyereh Ghana played out a 0-0 draw with Nigeria in the first leg of their World Cup showdown, but Partey and Co can still claim a spot at Qatar 2022 when two old adversaries lock horns again on Tuesday. After that encounter, attention will switch back to domestic matters. Partey has been impressing for Arsenal in the 2021-22 campaign, with his potential finally being unlocked during a second season at Emirates Stadium. He has become a key part of Mikel Arteta‚Äôs plans, with 25 appearances taken in during a campaign that was broken up in January by the Africa Cup of Nations. The Gunners have benefited from Partey‚Äôs considerable presence in their engine room, with a top-four finish and Champions League qualification still very much on the cards for a side that has gone five years without elite European competition.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/thomas-after-partey-arsenal-star-meets-lookalike/blt856d2f00c1ebfd0a,Chris Burton,dba0e7e7-1223-4667-872d-565740a3933d
Neville & Carragher in Twitter spat as ex-Man Utd full-back accused of staying silent & taking the Glazers' money,"Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher have caused a stir on social media after the pair fired shots at each other regarding the former Manchester United defender's employment under the Glazers. Neville was critical of the Glazer ownership of the club after the defeat to Brighton - stating his belief that Erik ten Hag needed more backing in the transfer market - but Carragher believes he stayed quiet while being paid in his role as a United ambassador. I‚Äôm thinking you will call for the Glazers to sell the club, after not saying it once while they paid you. https://t.co/WvkH3FIAOt Because of SAF, so if you get another top manager the Glazers are fine to stay!

Their ownership has long been protested, with their first official visit to the stadium following their takeover being met with fans venting their anger at the takeover. The group took on a debt to fund their takeover and the financial situation of the club has been murky ever since, with fans having never warmed to their ownership of the club. Perhaps the biggest issue came when Manchester United revealed their plans to join a breakaway European Super League, which owner Joel Glazer reportedly spearheaded alongside other major investors within football's elite. The fans protested the idea, and their renewed issues with the ownership, leading to supporters storming the pitch at Old Trafford and forcing the postponement of a fixture against bitter rivals Liverpool. Indeed, the United fans are planning to make their feelings clear during another game against Jurgen Klopp's side this season. Their fixture at Old Trafford, scheduled for August 22, has seen supporters call for a walkout to further demonstrate their anger at the Glazer family.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neville-carragher-twitter-spat-ex-man-utd-silent-taking/bltb6a12b863b65f587,Ewan Gennery,a8113de5-7169-4f99-8fb5-32fe94de19a5
Former Brazil star Roberto Carlos scores for Sunday League team in one-off appearance,"Roberto Carlos' Sunday League debut was one to remember as the ex-Brazil star scored before introducing his temporary team-mates to Sergio Ramos after the match. Carlos was playing for pub team Bull in the Barne after the club won a raffle in January as part of eBay's Dream Transfer competition, with the prize being the one-game signing of the Brazil star to aid the company's Football Beyond Borders campaign. And Carlos marked that game with a goal from the penalty spot as he took to the mud-soaked field on Friday. PENALTY! 4-3, Roberto Carlos slots home pic.twitter.com/bR4c84av0I The Brazilian's appearance was arranged for a Friday friendly against Harlescott Rangers, making his Sunday League debut after previously winning three Champions League and four La Liga titles with Real Madrid during his career. Carlos, who last played professionally for Delhi Dynamos in India in 2015, began the game on the bench for the club that play in the Shrewsbury & District Sunday League. He came off the bench to score a penalty, but it came in a losing effort as Bull in the Barne fell 4-3. ""I also come from a small-town background, so I like the vibe in the area,"" Carlos said afterwards. ""It's just amazing that football gives you these opportunities to be able to meet new people, new cultures, different places. I certainly haven't been somewhere like this before. ""Any time there is a charity element involved in a project it's very important for me, and what FBB (Football Beyond Borders) do is fantastic."" After the match, Carlos stuck around to celebrate with his new team-mates, introducing them to one his former team-mates in the process. While drinking at a local pub, Carlos called former Real Madrid star and current Paris Saint-Germain defender Sergio Ramos, much to the delight of everyone in attendance.

Bassey focused at Rangers amid speculation over his future,"Nigeria international Calvin Bassey has hinted he may be plying his trade with Rangers beyond this season. The 22-year-old has been inspiring form for the Gers domestically and in European competitions and he has been linked with a move away from the Scottish outfit owing to his exploits. However, the defender insists he wants to continue 'pushing hard' and stay focused at the club. ""I just want to keep my head down and keep pushing hard,"" Bassey said as quoted by the Scotsman. ""I‚Äôm focused here. I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm ready to get ready to come here for pre-season and be fitter than I was last pre-season and ready to see what next season holds for me and the boys."" On Saturday, the Nigerian shone as the Gers won the Scottish Cup after silencing Hearts 2-0 after extra time in a keenly contested final played at Hampden Park in Glasgow, with Ryan Jack and Scott Wright finding the net. It was a perfect response after Wednesday's 5-4 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt in a penalty shootout following a 1-1 draw in regulation and extra time of the Europa League final. ""It feels unbelievable [to win the Cup], I think the boys have been excellent this season, we‚Äôve worked so hard,"" Bassey continued. ""We had huge disappointment on Wednesday but to come back from that, 120 minutes there and another extra-time, it shows real character, drive and just how much each and every one of us loves this club. ""We just want to give our best and we are happy to end it with a reward."" The defender was full of praise for his teammates and the technical bench for the achievement. ""I thank my team-mates.

Fernandes: It was Ronaldo's time to take the penalty for Man Utd against Arsenal,"Bruno Fernandes has explained why he let Cristiano Ronaldo take Manchester United's winning penalty against Arsenal on Thursday night. United moved up to seventh in the Premier League table with a much-needed 3-2 home win against the Gunners, with Fernandes grabbing their first goal before Ronaldo took centre stage with a trademark double. Ronaldo's second came from the spot as he assumed penalty duties ahead of Fernandes, who has admitted that the pair did not discuss the change ahead of time. The Portuguese midfielder says he was happy to leave the responsibility to his compatriot after missing his last effort in United's 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa on September 25. ""We didn't have a chat. I missed the last one so I trust him in the same way I trust myself,"" Fernandes told BBC Sport after the game. ""It was time for Cristiano to take the penalty because I took the last one and missed it. It doesn‚Äôt matter who gets on the penalty."" Ronaldo surpassed 800 career goals with his brace against the Gunners, taking his tally since returning to United to 12 in 16 appearances in the process. Fernandes added to Amazon Prime Video on the way the 36-year-old continues to defy age with his performances: ""Incredible. We all know he is improving game by game, year by year. He wants to keep being the best and that's what he did. He knows how to self-motivate."" Fernandes also expressed his excitement over the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as United's new interim manager, with the German now officially in charge at Old Trafford until the end of the season. ""Now is a new beginning and a new start,"" he said. ""Everyone is looking forward to work with the new coach. When someone new comes in there are new opportunities. Everyone has the chance to get a position. ""Everyone has to work hard to get the chance to be in the first XI. We will meet him tomorrow and start working on the next game."" Fernandes went on to pay tribute to outgoing caretaker boss Michael Carrick, who announced he will also be stepping down as first-team coach following the Arsenal win. ""He can be a really top manager in the future if he gets the chance,"" said the 27-year-old. ""He knows how to speak, he knows a lot about football.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fernandes-ronaldo-penalty-man-utd-against-arsenal/blt7b9c8fd6c14a8185,James Westwood,29b48d66-8474-4e6d-8ca0-2e30678c6782
'Manager's dream' Minamino completes ‚Ç¨18m transfer to Monaco as Liverpool attacking overhaul continues,"Takumi Minamino has completed his ‚Ç¨18million (¬£15.5m) transfer from Liverpool to Monaco. The Japanese international becomes the latest player to depart the Reds as Jurgen Klopp continues his summer attacking overhaul at Anfield.¬† Minamino‚Äôs sale follows the exits of Sadio Mane and Divock Origi, with the 27-year-old bringing to an end a stop-start two-and-a-half years on Merseyside by joining the Ligue 1 side. Liverpool will receive a fixed fee of ‚Ç¨15m (¬£13m) with a further ‚Ç¨3m (¬£2.5m) in performance-related add-ons. That represents a significant profit on the ‚Ç¨8.4m (¬£7.25m/$9m) they paid to land him from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020.¬† Minamino made 55 appearances for the Reds, scoring 14 goals, and has signed a four-year contract with Monaco. Speaking to his new club's official website, Minamino said: ‚ÄúIt is a great joy for me to join AS Monaco.¬† ‚ÄúI am very happy to be part of this very exciting project, at a club with a great tradition and among the most recognised in Ligue 1. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to discovering my new environment and doing everything I can to help the team.‚Äù Paul Mitchell, the club‚Äôs sporting director, added: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased and excited to welcome Takumi to AS Monaco. ""He is a player we have known for many years and since his arrival in Europe, he has gained experience at the highest level, particularly in European competitions, and has won a number of titles.¬† ‚ÄúWith his winning culture, his ability to play in various positions on the pitch and his status as a key player with his national team, we are convinced that Takumi will contribute to the development of our young team and help the group to achieve our goals.¬† ‚ÄúWe are delighted that he has decided to be part of our project and welcome him.‚Äù Reacting to the news of Minamino's exit, Klopp told Liverpool's official website: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to see Taki go, but it‚Äôs a great move for him and one he thoroughly deserves. ‚ÄúAn amazing professional; super, talented player. As a person, he is full of warmth and makes everyone feel positive. A manager‚Äôs dream, to be honest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there will be those who think it didn‚Äôt quite work out. Those who think this are wrong. I don‚Äôt accept that. ‚ÄúHis contribution far outweighs the opportunities we were able to give, in terms of starting matches. He made us better each and every day he was with us ‚Äì not just in the games he played in but every single session in training. Perfect attitude, winner‚Äôs mentality. ‚ÄúHis performances and his goals are the reason we have had to redecorate the Champions Wall so often. His achievements here will stand the test of time. ‚ÄúI know he will be a big success at Monaco. I‚Äôm sure we will look on with a mix of celebration and envy as he progresses and flourishes there. He leaves with our appreciation and best wishes. Thank you, Taki.‚Äù Minamino arrived at Liverpool midway through their Premier League title-winning season of 2019-20, the Reds having taken advantage of a release clause in his contract with Salzburg. With the Austrians, he had impressed against Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side in two Champions League group matches and was viewed as a smart signing who would develop well in England. The interruption of the coronavirus pandemic however hindered his settling-in period significantly, and he found opportunities limited during his first 12 months with the club. So much so in fact, that he was loaned to Southampton on the final day of the January 2021 transfer window. Minamino made 10 appearances on at St Mary‚Äôs, scoring twice, before returning to Liverpool last summer. Last season, he would make a big contribution to the Reds‚Äô campaign, top scoring in both the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, both of which were won by Klopp‚Äôs side. He managed 10 goals in all competitions, a tally bettered only by Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino, but the arrivals of Darwin Nunez and Fabio Carvalho, as well as Luis Diaz in January, meant opportunities were set to be limited next season and a move was inevitable. He departs, as Liverpool‚Äôs official announcement suggests, ‚Äúhaving left a lasting impression on teammates, coaches and the club‚Äôs honours list‚Äù, without ever consistently scaling the heights his performances at Salzburg suggested he might.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-minamino-completes-transfer-monaco/blt5a80e80a63a8597d,Neil Jones,d31059da-68c7-40c8-9c22-ac3ac76307bf
Bayern Munich sign Gravenberch in ‚Ç¨25m transfer from Ajax,"Ryan Gravenberch has joined Bayern Munich from Ajax, it has been confirmed.  Bayern announced the transfer of the 20-year-old two days after he admitted in an interview that he would be making a move to the German champions. The Netherlands midfielder has made the step up to the Bavarian team after impressing in the Eredivisie with Ajax. Bayern have reportedly paid a fixed fee of ‚Ç¨19 million (¬£16m/$20m) plus an additional ‚Ç¨6m (¬£5m/$6m) in add-ons to sign the midfielder.  Furthermore, Ajax are believed to have secured a sell-on clause of seven-and-a-half per cent Bayern have confirmed that the 20-year-old has signed a five-year contract, tying him to Bundesliga winners until 2027. ""When the offer came from FC Bayern, I didn't have to think about it for long,"" Gravenberch told the club's website after the move was confirmed.  ""FC Bayern are one of the biggest clubs around; players from all over the world want to play for this club. I'm coming to Munich to win lots of titles - and FC Bayern are used to winning lots of titles.  ""Anything is possible with this club, including winning the Champions League. The togetherness in this team is very strong, which I like."" Bayern's director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic says he expects a lot of the new arrival, hailing him as one of Europe's most talented players. ""Ryan Gravenberch will offer a lot to our team. He's one of the biggest talents in Europe, has superb technical ability, always finds solutions in tight spaces, is very dynamic and a goal threat,"" he said.  ""The fact he's chosen FC Bayern shows that he's convinced by us as a club and the opportunities here. We love players with that mentality. We're confident that we'll enjoy lots of success with him."" By Daniel Nutz, GOAL Germany Gravenberch is a player with a lot of potential which can be developed greatly under Julian Nagelsmann. However, there is also big competition in his position, with Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka currently pulling the strings at the heart of Bayern's midfield. Nonetheless, Bayern plays in three different competitions for the most part of the season so Gravenberch should get enough playing time to continue his development.

Jesurun Rak-Sakyi: Crystal Palace's teenage goal machine who Chelsea let go,"It is a story that has been heard time and time again among football fans: the academy player who was released because they were too small, only for them to move on and make it to the top elsewhere. And it is a path that Crystal Palace teenager Jesurun Rak-Sakyi is hoping to follow, with the early signs encouraging for the forward as he aims for his true first-team breakout. One of the stars of English youth football over the past two seasons, Rak-Sakyi has racked up 35 direct goal contributions (20 goals, 15 assists) in 39 appearances across age-groups ranging from Under-18s to U23s. His 10 goals and five assists in 13 Premier League 2 games so far this season has seen him twice nominated for the competition's Player of the Month, with the 19-year-old keen to prove those who doubted him earlier in his career wrong. Rak-Sakyi was released by Chelsea in the summer of 2019, with the forward having gradually lost his place in a team which included Bayern Munich starlet Jamal Musiala and Juventus winger Samuel Iling-Junior, before he was left out of the squad altogether for the U16 Premier League Cup final win over Arsenal. Chelsea liked Rak-Sakyi's technical ability, and when it came to deciding on the futures of players that summer, his was the final name to be cut, with the Blues citing concerns over his lack of size and strength. Determined not to give up on his dream, Rak-Sakyi had trials at both Arsenal and Brighton before Palace were able to get a look at him close-up. They liked what they saw, and with Wolves next in the queue, the Eagles moved swiftly to offer the youngster a two-year scholarship. His first 18 months in south London, however, proved difficult, as Rak-Sakyi again struggled physically, and Palace were considering not offering him a professional contract right up until he exploded in January 2021. A run of 10 games in the U18s saw him score eight goals and provide nine assists, with pen put to paper on his first pro deal in April ahead of him making the first-team bench for Palace's final two games of the Premier League season. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: As well as having grown to a height of six foot (183cm), Rak-Sakyi has worked hard with his strength and conditioning coach, Michael Osei of Primed Athletes, to ensure that what has held him back previously does not come to the fore again as he takes the next steps in his career. ""He's quiet, humble and unassuming. He seems shy but he is confident deep down, and doesn't get over-excited,"" Osei (pictured below with Rak-Sakyi and his brother, Samuel) tells GOAL. ""He is so passionate and serious about what he does, with a father who is hands-on and influential in his career. He had just left Chelsea when I met him, and we had to work on the strength and balance. ""He isn't pushed over easily at all, and now he is knocking over his opponents. He has got even faster and more agile now, which is important for a winger. ""It helps that his brother is at Chelsea (Samuel plays for the Blues' U18s), and we train them together to get them competing against each other. Everything now is about getting Jes ready for first-team football."" Rather poetically, Rak-Sakyi made his Premier League debut from the bench against Chelsea on the opening day of the 2021-22 season, and was congratulated post-match by the Blues' academy bosses, as well as his current manager, Patrick Vieira. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a kid who spent pre-season with us and I was really pleased with what he‚Äôs been doing on the field,"" Vieira said of the youngster. ""He‚Äôs a really lovely kid, a good dribbler and he can score goals as well. We have to work with him to try to help him.‚Äù Rak-Sakyi‚Äôs got moves ‚ö°#CPFC | https://t.co/utMcYSDkhb pic.twitter.com/njzJq4VSSg Part of helping Rak-Sakyi's development is deciding whether him continuing to dominate at U23s level is good for him anymore, or whether he would be better served playing men's football on a weekly basis. That outing at Stamford Bridge remains Rak-Sakyi's only first-team appearance to date, with the likes of Wifried Zaha, Ebereche Eze, Michael Olise, Jordan Ayew and Odsonne Edouard all ahead of him in the pecking order when it comes to playing as a wide forward in Vieira's favoured 4-3-3 system. There is interest in the England U20 international from clubs in the Championship, however, while top-flight sides in Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Belgium have also enquired as to whether he would be available for a loan move in January. Palace do not want to lose Rak-Sakyi permanently, with them keen to eventually promote him into the first-team on a permanent basis, just as they have done with academy graduates Zaha, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Tyrick Mitchell in the past. As such, a loan move would suit all parties if the right club can be found that will further allow Rak-Sakyi to flourish. He is living proof that judgements over young footballers can be made prematurely, and Palace look set to reap the benefits.

Liverpool's ¬£64m new boy Nunez scores FOUR as Reds rout RB Leipzig in pre-season clash,"Darwin Nunez scored four goals during Liverpool's rout of RB Leipzig at Red Bull Arena on Thursday night. The ¬£64 million ($77m) summer signing shone after coming off the bench in the second half. Mohamed Salah also got in on the act as Liverpool made it two wins out of three in pre-season, but Nunez stole all the headlines after opening his scoring account following his big-money summer move from Benfica. Nunez was guilty of missing clear chances against Manchester United and Crystal Palace, with some fans subsequently labelling him a ""flop"" on social media. The Uruguayan has issued the perfect response to his critics with a clinical display against Leipzig, with his first goal for the Reds coming from the penalty spot. The 23-year-old showed excellent composure to finish after being played in by Trent Alexander-Arnold for his second, and completed his hat-trick after tapping home a Harvey Elliott cross from close range.

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was delighted to see Nunez silence his doubters, as he told reporters post-match: ""That's the best way obviously to stop all these discussions. ""We always think that if you pay a lot of money then the players feel no pressure or whatever. They are all completely normal human beings and the first touch is not perfect then all of a sudden. ""This generation of players read social media, which is really not smart, but they do. All of a sudden you get in a rush and these kinds of things.

"Man City's Grealish: Guardiola's changes against Liverpool 'too little, too late'","Jack Grealish does not believe Manchester City's season has been derailed because of their FA Cup semi-final defeat by Liverpool on Saturday, but admitted that the substitutions they made came too late in the game.  Pep Guardiola's team went three goals down in the clash at Wembley and managed to create some late drama with two late goals, but were unable to complete the comeback.  They are still competing on two fronts as they sit top of the Premier League table and are set to face Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League.  City had hoped to secure the European and domestic treble this season but went down 3-2 at Wembley to go crashing out of the competition. Grealish, however, insists there is no time to dwell on the FA Cup exit, telling reporters: ‚ÄúYou just go in there and look at the talent and the experience that we have in that dressing room ‚Äî I don't think anyone else in the league has a dressing room like it. ""Our performances, the competitions we are in and where we are in the league speak for themselves.  ‚ÄúWe just have to pick ourselves up, go again and hopefully by the end of the season we'll have [won] the Premier League and the Champions League.  ‚ÄúI'm not going sit here and say excuses.

I think we were much better for it but I think in the end it was too little, too late."" The Premier League leaders are in action again on Wednesday when they host Brighton at the Etihad Stadium.

Liverpool boss Klopp: Broadcasters preventing Premier League teams winning quadruple,"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has expressed his belief that broadcasters are preventing Premier League teams from winning the quadruple because they ""couldn't care less"" about player wellbeing. Klopp was a fierce critic of the shorter fixture schedule that was introduced last season due to the coronavirus-delayed 2019-20 campaign, with his side ultimately failing to defend their Premier League title after suffering a number of key injuries. Liverpool have bounced back this term to fight on four trophy fronts, but their manager remains unhappy with the quick turnaround between matches and has suggested that they are being unfairly punished for their success. Liverpool have one foot in the Champions League semi-finals after beating Benfica 3-1 in the first leg of their last-eight tie, and will look to finish the job at Anfield on Wednesday. Should the Reds get through, the two legs of the semi-final will fall on April 27 and May 4, with a Premier League clash at Newcastle wedged in between on April 30 - which is due to kick off at 12:30 BST. Klopp has been left exasperated by the fixture build-up, as he told his pre-match press conference: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go for four trophies, you are part of four competitions and we are thankfully good enough this year not to go out early. But the fixture list we have now, let‚Äôs get through it. The only game I am concerned about is Benfica tomorrow. ‚ÄúBecause of the success we had so far we play on Saturday against City [in the FA Cup semi-final]. Then we play [Manchester] United, then we play Everton [in the league]. Then, if we get through tomorrow, we have a semi-final and then BT and the Premier League thought we should have Newcastle away at 12.30.‚Äù Liverpool have already won the Carabao Cup, and only sit a point behind Manchester City in the Premier League table as they also continue to progress in Europe and the FA Cup. Klopp cannot see the Reds completing a clean sweep of silverware, though, as he added: ""The schedule, and how people use the fame in the moment ‚Äî Liverpool is hot and everyone wants to see them ‚Äî the TV stations couldn‚Äôt care less. It‚Äôs just not OK. ‚ÄúIf we play a Champions League semi-final, find me another league in the world and another broadcaster who would put the one team in the semi-finals ‚Äî it might be two or three English teams ‚Äî on at 12.30. What? What are you doing? Why would you do that? That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so difficult, that‚Äôs why it never happens, because nobody cares. It‚Äôs unbelievably difficult. ‚ÄúWe are still in three competitions and we play City, you saw how difficult that was. How could I sit here now and think about other cups? We play Benfica tomorrow and how can I sit here thinking about winning the Champions League? I don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWe just try to squeeze everything out to stay as long in the competition as somehow possible and then be there in the final, hopefully, or in the league to make the last decisive step.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-boss-klopp-broadcasters-preventing-premier-league/blt7256690f750bebfe,James Westwood,2eb5caae-8647-4106-8613-5cf0a07a522e
Matic reunites with Mourinho again as ex-Man Utd midfielder joins Roma on a free transfer,"Nemanja Matic has reunited with Jose Mourinho for the third time in his career, with the Serbia midfielder linking up with Roma on a free transfer after leaving Manchester United. The 33-year-old is ready to take on a new challenge in Italy after bringing a lengthy spell in English football to a close. Matic moved on to Old Trafford in the summer of 2017 but, despite having an extension option in his deal with the Red Devils, feels the time is right to spread his wings again and open a new chapter in Serie A. Matic is approaching the end of his distinguished playing career, and as such has only been tied to an initial one-year contract at Roma. That deal does, however, reportedly include the option of a 12-month extension if all parties agree to prolong their association in the summer of 2023. Jose Mourinho and Nemanja Matic are reunited once again at Roma üáÆüáπ pic.twitter.com/VT3DA35jwx He is set to earn a reported ‚Ç¨6 million-a-year salary at Stadio Olimpico. Speaking following the announcement of his move, Matic said: ‚ÄúI am pleased and honoured to be joining this club and I cannot wait to start the new season with my team-mates. ‚ÄúRoma is a big club, with amazing fans and a coach, Jose Mourinho, who is well known to everyone ‚Äì making the decision to come here very straightforward. ‚ÄúI hope that by working together we are able to achieve some great things.‚Äù Matic first signed for Chelsea in 2009, but was taken back to Stamford Bridge by Mourinho in January 2014 when a ¬£40m ($50m) deal was agreed with Benfica. The pair savoured Premier League title success in their one full season together, as the Blues returned to the summit of English football in 2014-15. Matic would spend a further two campaigns in west London before a familiar Portuguese coach came calling in 2017. He helped Manchester United to the FA Cup final in 2018, only to suffer a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Chelsea. Mourinho was relieved of his duties at Old Trafford in December of that year, but Matic stayed on to take his overall tally of appearances for the Red Devils to 189. ‚ÄúNemanja, woooahhh‚Ä¶‚Äù üéµ#MUFC | #MUNBRE pic.twitter.com/m7Tp6BsZzy He will now be hoping to chase down more major silverware under a proven winner, with Roma still basking in the glow of their 2021-22 success in the inaugural Europa Conference League. While United have allowed Matic to depart as a free agent, they have also seen fellow midfielders Paul Pogba, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard tread a similar path. With proven international performers heading out the Old Trafford exits, it comes as no surprise to find that the Red Devils are being linked with a number of midfield reinforcements. Erik ten Hag is inheriting the managerial reins at Premier League heavyweights this summer and is reported to have his sights set on a player that he knows well from his days at Ajax. Barcelona star Frenkie de Jong has emerged as a top target for United, with GOAL revealing that the Netherlands international could be lured away from Camp Nou for around ‚Ç¨60m (¬£51m/$63m). While De Jong would be another creative option for the Red Devils, interest in West Ham's more defensively-minded star Declan Rice also remains ‚Äì although the England international will not come cheap as the Hammers hold out for a nine-figure asking price. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who continues to catch the eye at Lazio, has seen a big-money transfer to Manchester speculated on for some time, while Kalvin Phillips of Leeds United has emerged as a shock target given that few players cross the fierce divide between nothern rivals. Funds are expected to be invested in United‚Äôs engine room this summer, but they also have the option of absorbing Donny van de Beek ‚Äì another player that Ten Hag worked with at Ajax ‚Äì back into their ranks from a loan spell at Everton, while England Under-21 international James Garner is returning from a promotion-winning stint at Nottingham Forest.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/matic-mourinho-roma-free-transfer-man-utd/blt2b9c86462f3906e6,Chris Burton,388ac43f-9c97-4ec7-91ba-2f98d99c11ad
'It‚Äôs just a football game' - Guardiola tries to keep the ordinary in extraordinary final day,"Pep Guardiola has kept things relaxed in the build-up to Manchester City's biggest game of the season. His players were given two days off at the start of the week and Ilkay Gundogan took the opportunity to fly to Copenhagen and marry his model fiancee Sara Arfaoui. Back at work, his squad have been all smiles and boosted by the return from injury of Kyle Walker and John Stones and the luxury of no midweek fixture. It was the same from Guardiola in a serene pre-match news conference on Friday as he joked about allowing Manchester United fans to join in any post-match title celebrations because of their dislike for Liverpool more than their city rivals. But as much as he tries to keep the build up as calm as possible, he knows his players will be deadly serious when the moment comes. ""Today we trained a training session like we would in a normal game during the season,"" the City boss said ahead of the match. ""Nothing special. ""It‚Äôs not necessary to tell them about the importance of the game. They know it, they feel it and, yeah, go there and do it."" Ordinarily, City would be overwhelming favourites to beat an Aston Villa team languishing in the lower half of the table and with just two wins from their last 10 Premier League matches. But throw in Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard as the Villa manager along with former Reds Philippe Coutinho and Danny Ings rested for the final day, and there's plenty that can see a narrative opening up. To cool heads an upset would still seem unlikely. City have won their last eight matches against Villa - and have not dropped points at the Etihad Stadium against them in the Premier League since 2007. And Guardiola will do his best to keep the extraordinary out of Sunday's encounter - until the final whistle at least. ""I said to the players, it‚Äôs just a football game, focus on the football game, don‚Äôt think of the consequences, of how happy we will be if we win or how sad we will be if we lose, forget about it, it‚Äôs just a football game and just think about what you have to do to win against Aston Villa,"" he said. ""If you think about it being one more title or one less title - yeah this kind of thing is important, everyone knows it ‚Äì but it‚Äôs a football game. ""Do they play with [Ollie] Watkins or [Danny] Ings and Watkins? Does Douglas Luiz play as a holding midfielder or as a three, or not, will [John] McGinn move outside or not? This is what we have to handle, these kind of things are what we have to think about if we want to win the game. ""With our people, as a club we have not been here many times in our time so once we are here, should we be anxious or nervous? No. No way. Go there and try to enjoy the game, enjoy the moments. ""We will suffer in moments, if we concede a goal, come on, let‚Äôs go, try again, try again and the good moments continue and do it. From my little experience this is the best way to approach these situations."" Of course, Guardiola has plenty of experience. This would be his fourth title in six years at the Etihad, following on from three in three years at Bayern Munich and three in four at Barcelona. This will be the ninth time that the destination of the Premier League title has been decided on the final day and the fourth occasion involving City. Three years ago they pipped Liverpool with a win on the last day; just as they did in 2014 under Manuel Pellegrini. The other occasion was 10 years ago when Sergio Aguero's 94th-minute winner settled the most dramatic Premier League title race in history. As unforgettable as it was, not many City fans could face going through it again and Guardiola would prefer it if they could forget what was at stake. ""The day after we‚Äôll be happy if we have won,"" he said. ""But my advice is to try to be happy playing football, this is more important than winning titles. ""You feel alone after two or three days. That‚Äôs all? All the effort for that? Having it on your CV is good but no more than that. It‚Äôs magnificent and then you defend over a year being a champion. Someone has to take us out."" For Guardiola, it will make little difference to his reputation. A week after, his side will be missing from the Champions League final after their catastrophic collapse in Real Madrid and for his critics, European failure will always blight his reign. However, after nine months and 38 matches, he insists that winning the league gives the most satisfaction and shows who is the best even if others won't agree. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying the Champions League is not important,"" he added. ""We‚Äôre mad, crazy to win it. We want it, we love it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to be in Paris next week but to win 38 games, rather than six, eight or nine games, is different. ‚ÄúAlways I like it, since I was a player. The league is nice and we are on the verge of that. We are close.‚Äù Another ordinary match, another 90 minutes of what they have done all season and City will have their title.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/it-s-just-a-football-game-guardiola-tries-to-keep-the/blt53924d7b8e4131b1,Jonathan Smith,1209989c-6b38-4ead-9fe5-965dc772061c
Jorginho reacts to fresh transfer talk at Chelsea with statement on future plans,"Jorginho is among those that continue to generate transfer talk at Chelsea, but the 30-year-old midfielder remains adamant that his immediate future lies at Stamford Bridge. The Italy international is into the final 12 months of his contract in west London and has attracted admiring glances from Juventus for some time. There is no indication that he will be committing to fresh terms with Premier League heavyweights, but any plans to head back to Serie A appear set to be shelved by the former Napoli star as he focuses on the 2022-23 campaign in England. The Euro 2020 winner, who has taken in 188 appearances for Chelsea across four years, has told The Athletic when asked if his intention is to stay put this summer: ‚ÄúOf course, I love Chelsea. ‚ÄúI feel very well here and of course, I‚Äôd like to stay. ‚ÄúBut you know, there is a lot going on and we don‚Äôt know.

He added on the gossip that follows him around: ‚ÄúYes for many years now, every single year! ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think like this. I just think about where I am and I need to focus 100 per cent.

Bayern striker Lewandowski ends sponsorship deal with reported Russia supporters Huawei,"Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has ended a sponsorship deal with Huawei, representatives of the Poland international have confirmed to GOAL and SPOX. The Chinese technology company is alleged to have helped Russia secure its network against cyber attacks following an invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Lewandowski was a global brand ambassador for Huawei, with his profile helping the firm to expand its reach in Europe, but he has now severed all ties and walked away from an agreement that could cost him around ‚Ç¨5 million (¬£4m/$5m). GOAL and SPOX can confirm that Lewandowski's sponsorship with Huawei has ended. The 33-year-old‚Äôs adviser, Tomasz Zawislak also told the AFP news agency: ‚ÄúToday we made the decision to end the marketing cooperation between Robert Lewandowski and the Huawei brand.‚Äù He added that the ‚Äúimplementation of all advertising services on our part‚Äù will be suspended, but he did not give an official reason for that action being taken. Lewandowski has spoken out in support of Ukraine since a Russian invasion of the nation was sanctioned by Vladimir Putin. He donned a blue and yellow captain‚Äôs armband when taking to the field for Bayern against Eintracht Frankfurt on February 26. The prolific Polish frontman also publicly backed the decision of his country to boycott a World Cup play-off semi-final clash with Russia that was due to take place on March 24. That fixture has since been wiped from the calendar following an announcement from FIFA and UEFA that Russian teams ‚Äì national and domestic ‚Äì would be banned from continental and global competition until further notice. Lewandowski posted on social media: ‚ÄúIt is the right decision!' ‚ÄúI can't imagine playing a match with the Russian national team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. ‚ÄúRussian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can't pretend that nothing is happening.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-striker-lewandowski-gives-up-lot-of-money-end-sponsorship-/blte96f2756f6d6b728,GOAL,9c7362f9-b942-4b08-83e3-0909da8b959e
Amnesty International reveals ‚Äòforced labour‚Äô in pre-World Cup report on Qatar,"Amnesty International has revealed in a report into the working conditions of security guards that are involved in projects linked to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar that certain individuals are being put through ‚Äúforced labour‚Äù. The human rights organisation has documented the experiences of 34 employees from eight private security companies as they continue to cast an eye over goings on in the Middle East during the build up to a major international tournament. It found that migrant workers are being forced into shifts for months or even years on end without a day off, in a clear breach of Qatari law, with a number of the business involved tied to projects at World Cup venues or events such as the 2020 Club World Cup and 2021 FIFA Arab Cup. Amnesty has said in a statement released on the organisation‚Äôs official website: ‚ÄúSecurity guards in Qatar are working in conditions which amount to forced labour, including on projects linked to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Amnesty International has found. In a new report, 'They think that we're machines', the organization documented the experiences of 34 current or former employees of eight private security companies in Qatar. ‚ÄúThe security guards, all migrant workers, described routinely working 12 hours a day, seven days a week ‚Äì often for months or even years on end without a day off. Most said their employers refused to respect the weekly rest day which is required by Qatari law, and workers who took their day off anyway faced being punished with arbitrary wage deductions. One man described his first year in Qatar as ‚Äòsurvival of the fittest‚Äô.‚Äù Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty International‚Äôs Head of Economic and Social Justice, has added: ‚ÄúThe abuses we uncovered can all be traced back to the massive power imbalance that still exists between employers and migrant workers in Qatar, indicating that there are still major gaps in the authorities‚Äô enforcement of labour laws. Many of the security guards we spoke to knew their employers were breaking the law but felt powerless to challenge them. Physically and emotionally exhausted, workers kept reporting for duty under threat of financial penalties ‚Äì or worse, contract termination or deportation. ‚ÄúDespite the progress Qatar has made in recent years, our research suggests that abuses in the private security sector ‚Äì which will be increasingly in demand during the World Cup ‚Äì remain systematic and structural. Employers are still exploiting their workers in plain sight, and the Qatari authorities must take urgent measures to protect workers and hold abusers accountable. ‚ÄúWith the World Cup just months away, FIFA must focus on doing more to prevent abuses in the inherently perilous private security sector, or see the tournament further marred by abuse. ‚ÄúMore broadly, FIFA must also use its leverage to pressure Qatar to better implement its reforms and enforce its laws. Time is fast running out ‚Äì if better practices are not established now, abuses will continue long after fans have gone home.‚Äù World football‚Äôs governing body has said, after agreeing to meet with Amnesty when human rights concerns were raised regarding working conditions in Qatar: ‚ÄúFIFA does not accept any abuse of workers by companies involved in the preparation and delivery of the World Cup.‚Äù It added: ‚ÄúFollowing inspections during the Club World Cup and Arab Cup, contractors that failed to comply with the required standards were identified and the issues found addressed on the spot.‚Äù The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), who were appointed by FIFA as World Cup organisers, have said of their decision not to renew contracts with two companies: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, three companies were found to be non-compliant across a number of areas during the 2020 Club World Cup and 2021 Arab Cup. ‚ÄúThese violations were completely unacceptable and led to a range of measures being enforced, including placing contractors on a watch-list or black-list to avoid them working on future projects - including the Fifa World Cup - before reporting [them] to the Ministry of Labour.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/amnesty-international-reveals-forced-labour-in-pre-world-cup/blt220ef1f9b1265b8e,Chris Burton,8055f01f-6e74-43e6-bd8b-bade0d1bb2fa
Arsenal & Man Utd fans applaud Cristiano Ronaldo in seventh minute as they show support after tragic death of infant son,"Arsenal and Manchester United fans came together in the seventh minute of their Premier League game on Saturday to show support for Cristiano Ronaldo after the death of his infant son. Fans of both teams applauded the Portugal international, who was playing for the first time after revealing he and his partner Georgia Rodriguez had suffered the terrible loss. It is the second time such a tribute has taken place, after Liverpool and United fans also applauded in the seventh minute of their Premier League clash on Tuesday. A perfectly observed tribute to Ronaldo and his family was observed by both sets of fans at Emirates Stadium, as they stood to applaud the player. Arsenal fans had also cheered Ronaldo onto the pitch for his pre-match warm-up, with the Portuguese playing in this game after missing the Liverpool match while on compassionate leave. Banners showing support for Ronaldo were also seen in the home and away ends, and he was seen applauding the Arsenal fans in thanks for their tribute. He and Rodriguez announced their sad loss in an Instagram post on Monday evening. She had been pregnant and the couple had been expecting twins, although tragically only the baby girl survived. Ronaldo returned to training on Wednesday following the Liverpool match, and posted a message of thanks to both sets of fans for the support shown during that game. On Thursday, Ronaldo shared the first picture of his newborn daughter alongside Rodriguez and their other children, Cristiano Junior, Eva, Mateo and Alana Martina. ""Home sweet home. Gio and our baby girl are finally together with us,"" he wrote on social media. ""We want to thank everyone for all the kind words and gestures.

'Amazing sport!' - Liverpool defender Alexander-Arnold spotted with Verstappen at F1's British Grand Prix,"Trent Alexander-Arnold has hailed Formula 1 as an ""amazing"" sport after the Liverpool right-back made a trip to the 2022 British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday, where he met world champion Max Verstappen and switched shirts with him. The England defender was spotted after the race with the Dutchman, who also met his Reds team-mate Virgil van Dijk and Manchester City star Nathan Ake on an action-packed day that saw Carlos Sainz win his maiden race in the sport. Alexander-Arnold was also caught during the pre-race grid walk for an interview with Sky Sports presenter Martin Brundle - and the Merseyside favourite was quick to say that while it was his first time at a race, he is a huge fan of the sport. ""[It is my] first time, [but] hopefully the first of many,"" Alexander-Arnold stated. ""I absolutely love F1 and it's so exciting to be here. ""It doesn't really allow me with my schedule, but I'm really happy to be here today. The excitement is my favourite bit. I grew up watching it with my dad and my family."" The star also weighed in on team-mate Mohamed Salah's new deal, adding: ""Of course [I'm happy with it]. Hopefully, [we have] a few more years with him to win more trophies."" While world champion Verstappen missed out on a podium finish behind Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez and Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton, the Dutchman has already weighed in on footballing matters this term.

Pogba 'not against' PSG move as Anelka claims Man Utd star is 'not well psychologically' at Old Trafford,"Paul Pogba is ""not against"" a move to Paris Saint-Germain, according to Nicolas Anelka, who has expressed his belief that the Manchester United star is ""not well psychologically"" at Old Trafford. United spent a club-record ¬£89 million ($119m) to re-sign Pogba from Juventus in 2016, having seen him emerge as one of the top midfielders in Europe after sending him off to Turin four years earlier. The Frenchman has shown flashes of the same brilliance during his second spell in Manchester, but has been largely dogged by inconsistency amid struggles with injury and is now edging towards the final few months of his contract. Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly among a whole host of top clubs interested in securing Pogba on a free transfer in the summer, with the midfielder yet to show any sign of committing to an extension at Old Trafford. Former PSG and France striker Anelka claims he has already asked his countryman if he'd be interested in a switch to Parc des Princes - where he believes he could rediscover his best form. ""If he wants to come to Paris? I discussed that six months ago with him and he would not be against coming to PSG"", Anelka said when discussing Pogba's future on RMC Sport. ""If he comes, we will forget all his injuries and we will see that he is a top player."" A man who also took in spells at Arsenal and Real Madrid at the height of his career went on to suggest that Pogba is struggling mentally in his current surroundings. ""It's not the best club where he can have fun and show his talent,"" Anelka said of United.¬† ‚ÄúI think PSG would be great for him.¬†Some say it wouldn't be good for Paris, as he is supposedly often injured.¬† ""But I think his injuries are due to his life in Manchester, because he is not well psychologically."" It has been reported that the Red Devils have submitted several renewal offers to Pogba, but he appears content to run down his current deal. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has hinted that the club won't stand in Pogba's way if he wants to leave, but also says it's in his best interests to play to his maximum until the end of the season. ""The question is how much does he still want to be a part of this group, how much does he still feel emotionally and physically on board,"" Rangnick told reporters when discussing Pogba's role in his squad in January. ""As long as this is the case, he will play. ""He wants to show the fans of Manchester United, the board, the whole world what kind of player he can be and even if it's only to show enough for a new contract elsewhere, he will be highly motivated to do that and why should I then not play him?""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pogba-not-against-psg-move-as-anelka-claims-man-utd-star-is/blt7a01889078e75430,James Westwood,5e8a8117-895e-499b-bd69-78db76eb7de5
Lautaro: Mbappe's comments about South America were not fair!,"Inter and Argentina star Lautaro Martinez was not impressed to hear Kylian Mbappe's comparisons between European and South American football.  The Paris Saint-Germain man raised the heat ahead of the World Cup by stating that Europe's contingent would have a significant advantage over their rivals in Qatar.  As well as Lautaro, Aston Villa's Argentina No. 1 Emiliano Martinez also hit out at the France star for his words.  Mbappe, who won the World Cup with France in 2018, courted controversy with his opinions on Argentina and Brazil's chances in 2022. ""Argentina haven't played games of great quality to reach the World Cup,"" he said to TNT Sports Brasil. ""In South America football isn't as advanced as Europe. That's why if you look at the last World Cups it's always the Europeans that win."" ""Most of those of us who have been called up are in Europe and every day, even every training, you measure up against them,"" Lautaro explained to TyC Sports. ""That's why I'll say that we're feeling good and working on the ideas the trainer asks of us. We are happy with how it's working and what we're doing on the field.  ""I saw what [Mbappe] said, but Argentina and Brazil have players of great quality and talent.  ""Brazil, just like us, has most of its players in Europe. I thought it was an unfair comment."" Martinez agreed with his compatriot that Mbappe was off-target with his remarks. ""Bolivia in La Paz, Ecuador with 30-degree celsius heat, Colombia where you can't even breathe... they (in Europe) always play on perfect pitches and have no idea what South America is all about,"" the Villa star fired to TyC Sports. ""Every time you travel with the national team you've got two days coming and going, you are exhausted and can't train much.  ""When an England player goes to train they are at the ground in half an hour. Let them go to Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and see if it is that easy.""

The Mexico national team, under the guidance of former Barcelona head coach Gerard Martino, are currently ninth in the world, according to the latest FIFA ranking published on March 31, 2022. They are also the top-ranked nation in the CONCACAF region and have climbed three places from 12th compared to the FIFA ranking in February 2022.

Tributes pour in after Germany legend Uwe Seeler dies aged 85,"Germany legend Uwe Seeler has died at the age of 85. Seeler enjoyed an illustrious 21-year career that saw him remain loyal to one club, Hamburg, between 1952 and 1973. The former striker scored a staggering 445 goals in 519 games for Hamburg, and was just as prolific at international level with the German national team. Seeler found the net 43 times in 72 outings for West Germany and appeared in four World Cups, including as captain in his country's 4-2 final defeat to England in 1966. He is widely regarded as one of Germany's greatest ever players and remains Hamburg's all-time top scorer in the Bundesliga to this day with 137 goals to his name. Seeler is survived by his wife Ilka, with whom he had three daughters. His grandson, Levin Oztunali, currently plays in the German top-flight for Union Berlin. Hamburg board member Jonas Boldt released a statement paying tribute to Seeler on behalf of the club, which reads: ""We will never forget him and will always cherish him. ""Uwe Seeler stands for everything that characterises a good person: Down-to-earthness, loyalty, joie de vivre, plus he was always approachable. He is the epitome of HSV."" We mourn the loss of Uwe #Seeler. The greatest HSV player of all time has died at the age of 85.Rest in peace, dear Uwe üôèüèº pic.twitter.com/A84SOttaDP Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn, meanwhile, described Seeler's death as a ""painful loss for the entire football family"" before adding: ""When you think of German football and greatest players, you think of Uwe Seeler.""

Man City star Gundogan's new wife slams 'fake news' transfer reports and announces marriage to Germany international,"Manchester City star Ilkay Gundogan's new wife has slammed the rumours linking the midfielder with a transfer as ""fake news"" while announcing their marriage. Gundogan became Pep Guardiola's first signing as City head coach back in June 2016 as he moved to the Etihad Stadium from Borussia Dortmund, and has since played a key role in the most successful period in the club's history. The 31-year-old has been a regular in Guardiola's line-up once again in 2021-22, but it has been reported that City will look to sell the midfielder this summer rather than extend his contract. Gundogan, who is set to become a free agent in 2023, was reportedly pictured travelling from Manchester airport to Madrid in a private plane earlier this week, fueling talk of a potential transfer. The Germany international and his partner, Sara Benamira, moved to silence speculation over his future by announcing their marriage on social media. ""We are married. We are really happy‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt wait to celebrate with our families and friends. Gundos,"" the joint Instagram post reads. The final post appears to have been edited, with a previous version now doing the rounds on social media alongside one on Sara's Instagram stories in which she denies the reported trip to Madrid. ""We are married. We are really happy‚Ä¶ we wanted to keep it private but unfortunately after this fake news about my husband I felt forced to say the truth,"" the original post reportedly read. Sara's additional message to her followers said: ""Never been in Madrid. Sometimes private reason is just not football."" Gundogan has won 10 trophies during his time at City, including three Premier League titles and one FA Cup. The German has also picked up a Champions League runners-up medal while contributing 47 goals and 33 assists in 252 appearances across all competitions. City are poised to retain their top-flight crown, but must beat Aston Villa in their final game of the season to ensure that Liverpool cannot pip them to the finishing post.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-star-gundogan-new-wife-fake-news-transfer-reports/bltc0a16b72c242fefc,James Westwood,dd010b9c-dd4e-4c8e-967b-f4438182d3e9
USMNT celebrate with banner saying 'Qualified'... despite not yet sealing World Cup spot,"The U.S. men's national team haven't quite booked their spot at the World Cup, despite a banner unveiled after Sunday's 5-1 win over Panama saying otherwise. Following the match in Orlando, the error was quickly noticed and the banner put away. The U.S. were unable to qualify immediately due to Costa Rica's win over El Salvador, but only a historic loss against Los Ticos on Wednesday will prevent them from sealing a spot in Qatar. ""We made a big step towards our goal of qualifying for the World Cup,"" head coach Gregg Berhalter said. ""We know we're not there yet despite what that banner might have said.  ""We know we still have a game to go and it's a difficult game in Costa Rica so our job right now is to recover, do regeneration and then get healthy guys, fit guys, on the field and go compete in San Jose, where we've never won before."" ‚ÄúThe guys didn't know at all what it said. It was just handed to them,‚Äù Christian Pulisic told MLSScoccer.com. ""So once we realized, it's just, there's no need to show that off because we still have a job to do. We know that.‚Äù The U.S. will book their ticket to Qatar with a win or draw in Costa Rica, while goal difference also gives them a massive cushion even if they do lose. Berhalter's side will head into the match with a massive edge, with Costa Rica required to win by at least six goals to leapfrog the USMNT for third spot.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-accidentally-celebrate-with-banner-saying-qualified/bltdc37b075600a927f,Ryan Tolmich,100bd04f-50b6-46bb-a10c-62bd5370836b
'I don't think I'll score one like that again!' - England star Russo amazed at her Women's Euro 2022 backheel goal,"England star Alessia Russo admits she'll likely never be able to produce a goal quite as daring as the one she scored in the 4-0 victory over Sweden in the Women's Euro 2022 semi-final. Russo converted a backheel flick that nutmegged the goalkeeper to put Tuesday's match away and send Bramall Lane into a frenzy. It was Russo's fourth goal of the tournament. She also netted twice against Northern Ireland and once against Norway. The Lionesses are now a step from their first-ever UEFA crown, and they can win it on their home turf at Wembley on Sunday. ""To be honest, I missed the first [shot of the move], we were actually working on cut backs in training the other day,"" she told reporters. ""Once it fell back to me I thought ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the quickest route for me to get this ball in the back of the net?‚Äô Because I should have scored in the first place, I just swung a foot at it and luckily it hit the back of the net. ""I think [it was one of my best goals]. Yeah of course, to score in a semi final and progress to the final is a huge highlight of my career. I don‚Äôt normally score back heels and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see one again, I‚Äôll take it for now."" On whether the audacious attempt summed up her confidence, Russo added: ""Yeah, I‚Äôm loving it so that helps with confidence. I think when you‚Äôre enjoying your football you play your best. Maybe it does show confidence but I‚Äôm just loving playing football."" The Lionesses will have the rest of the week to prepare for the final, where they will meet either Germany or France. England have been to two UEFA finals previously. They lost to Sweden at that stage in 1984 and fell to Germany in 2009.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-star-russo-amazed-backheel-goal/blt9be0f32d090a3781,Dan Bernstein,8f556799-2556-44ab-a04b-ae1cd7d6f508
'Lukaku wants to be important' - Transfer situation analysed by Belgium boss Martinez amid Chelsea rumours,"Belgium coach Roberto Martinez says that the uncertainty surrounding Romelu Lukaku's future is down to his desire to be important for his team. The striker, who recently suffered an injury setback in the Nations League, has been linked with a move away from Chelsea following a disappointing first season back at Stamford Bridge. A move back to Inter has become the most likely destination for the Belgium international, and his lawyer has been investigating the possibility of a deal with the Serie A side. Martinez is confident that Lukaku will make the best call for his career, telling reporters: ""He wants to be important and enjoy his football. I'm sure the decision in the summer will be the right one. ""In Belgium we are quite relaxed with Romelu's situation. I know it is a big topic, but at the moment he is trying to recover from the injury and that's the only thing he has in his mind. ""If he stays at Chelsea it will be for the right reasons. If he's moving away it will be because everyone agrees to it. ""Romelu is a player I know very well. I managed him at club level (at Everton) at a very young age. ""He was 19 and had a very different position than he has now. Now he's a player who is very mature and very clear what he wants."" Chelsea are open to allowing the forward to leave after a season in which he scored 15 goals in 44 appearances in all competitions. GOAL reported this week that the Premier League side are open to a loan deal, but would charge a fee of around ‚Ç¨25 million for him. Meanwhile, Lukaku is open to accepting a pay cut of around 40 per cent to get away from the London team.

Gabriel Jesus remains quiet on exit rumours amid Man City's Haaland pursuit,"Gabriel Jesus says it‚Äôs not the right time to talk about his future amid suggestions he could leave Manchester City at the end of the season.  The Premier League champions are favourites to complete the signing of Erling Haaland in the summer, prompting rumours that a forward will be sold to make room in the squad for the Borussia Dortmund striker.  Jesus, who joined City in 2017, is still fighting to hold down a regular starting place and has been linked with moves to Juventus, Barcelona and Arsenal.  ‚ÄúI think it's not time to think about this,‚Äù the Brazilian told reporters when asked if he would stay and fight for his place if City added another striker. ‚ÄúI think you expect me to say this, but it's true.  ‚ÄúNow is the best moment of the season, I want to enjoy it, to keep focused on my team, with my team-mates to fight for the Premier League.  ‚ÄúI won it with my team-mates three times and I know how that feels and I want to have that feeling again and then, of course, we have the tough, tough game on Tuesday against Real Madrid, a tough opponent, and that is my focus.‚Äù  With fierce competition for places, the Brazilian striker has started half of City‚Äôs Premier League matches but only once in the Champions League in a round of 16 clash against Sporting CP when the tie was already effectively won.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just me, everyone's going to say I want to play,‚Äù Jesus added when asked about game time.  ‚ÄúWe have a lot of good strikers, wingers and forwards, so yes, everyone wants to play. That's the challenge, you have to keep focused on the game and then when you get the opportunity, you try to do your best.‚Äù  The 25-year-old goes into the Champions League semi-final first leg having scored an impressive four times in the 5-1 victory over Watford on Saturday, taking his total to 11 for the season.  He also starred in both legs of the last-16 triumph over Real in 2020, scoring home and away in an unusual left-wing role.  ‚ÄúI am happy because I have the confidence not just from [Pep Guardiola] but also from the players,‚Äù Jesus said. ‚ÄúIt's not news for me or for the players.  ‚ÄúWhen I start or Riyad [Mahrez] starts, Raz [Sterling], Phil [Foden], [Jack] Grealish, Bernardo, [Ilkay] Gundogan, we try our best, everyone has the experience.  ‚ÄúSo I'm still young, but I think in the last five or six years I have played a little bit tough and big games so I know I can play but sometimes the manager tries another player and I try to focus when I get the chance.‚Äù ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gabriel-jesus-remains-quiet-on-exit-rumours-amid-man-city-s/bltbc959e8c3c9f0da0,Jonathan Smith,27b1b5f2-0d9b-4d71-849a-7af1c2d7f2a6

Rangnick's Man Utd rebuild needs to go a lot further than formations and systems,"If Ralf Rangnick had any doubts about the size of the task that lay ahead of him at Manchester United, he was made acutely aware of how tough the next few months are going to be as he watched his side struggle to earn a point against relegation-threatened Newcastle on Monday.¬† There were countless examples that might have left Rangnick wondering whether this group of players are up to executing his style of football.¬† Like Fred misplacing one of his 43 passes, the numerous times that Newcastle danced through his team‚Äôs back line or Bruno Fernandes losing possession 26 times.¬† On the basis of the display at St James‚Äô Park, the interim manager needs to go back to basics before he even considers a new style and formation if he is going to salvage their Premier League top-four hopes this season.¬† He stood on the touchline, shaking his head and rubbing his forehead, and, with half an hour on the clock, he shrugged his shoulders to suggest he had no idea why they were performing the way that they were. There was an air of disbelief.¬† The German had gone into this fixture feeling confident after getting the majority of his squad back to full fitness after the Covid-enforced shutdown but now, three league games into his tenure, he‚Äôll be more aware than ever of the job he has got on his hands.¬†¬† He hasn‚Äôt got long to sort these problems out either; Burnley at home await on Thursday night.¬† So what‚Äôs the problem? Is the new 4-2-2-2 formation too complex for the players to get a hold of? Are players not being utilised to their full potential?¬† Fernandes, for example, does not look like a natural fit out on the right side and the lack of quality in midfield leaves United very exposed in the centre when the front four push forward.¬† While the switch to a 4-1-3-2 formation in the second half against Newcastle saw a slight improvement, the fundamental problems persisted and reinforced the idea that it is not necessarily the system that is the biggest problem. ‚ÄúIt was not a problem of formation, it was a problem of energy and intensity,‚Äù Rangnick said after. ‚ÄúAlso of speed, how we play in those one-on-one duels. This is something we have to get better at.‚Äù The issues the former RB Leipzig coach has with this Manchester United team are two-fold. First, there are too many unforced and technical errors and second, they are lacking intensity and aggression.¬† Former defender Gary Neville believes the latter is a behavioural and attitude problem. ‚ÄúThey are a bunch of whingebags, their arms were in the air. They were shocking in the first half. They got the last manager the sack and they will get a lot of managers the sack like that,‚Äù he said on Sky Sports. ‚ÄòWhingebags‚Äô is probably a new term for Rangnick to get his head around and, while he admits there are bigger problems, the body language and attitude of the players is something that needs to change. That is one reason why Jadon Sancho started the game on the bench.¬† Fernandes was booked for dissent, Ronaldo was lucky not to be sent off for a challenge on Ryan Fraser - borne out of frustration - and every member of the starting XI was culpable of throwing arms up in the air and complaining in the direction of a team-mate.¬† United lack control and lack precision but the players also seem to lack belief in themselves and in one another.¬† It is no wonder Rangnick wanted to bring in Sascha Lense as a sport psychologist.¬† There is no cohesion nor method to the attack, there are constant issues in defence - as evidenced by the lead-up to Allan Saint-Maximin's opening goal - and problems in and out of possession.¬† These were all issues associated with Rangnick‚Äôs predecessor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and while the new man has only had a few weeks to get his ideas across, and that term has been punctuated by a Covid-19 outbreak that shut the training ground, the display at Newcastle was as abject as anything under Solskjaer. Rangnick knows what he wants but the players need to step up, like Edinson Cavani did on United's equaliser. It is hardly surprising that the interim manager ""didn‚Äôt like the performance at all"".¬† ""In three days we have the next game. We can do better but we have to do it. We shouldn't look for excuses. We need to be better and get more physical,‚Äù he said.¬† Never mind the talk of different systems and coordinated attacking formations, Rangnick needs to start with the basics before he can start to build something of his own.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rangnick-s-man-utd-rebuild-needs-to-go-a-lot-further-than/blt591ea65d7ab5df17,Charlotte Duncker,22551582-a424-4ecb-9076-937b09a0644a

2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Egypt‚Äôs Queiroz ahead of Senegal showdown - ‚ÄòI am among world‚Äôs best coaches‚Äô,"Egypt's head coach, Carlos Queiroz, has claimed he is one of the best 10 coaches in the world. The Portuguese tactician oversaw the Pharaohs' picking up a 1-0 win against Senegal on Friday at the Cairo International Stadium in the first leg of their World Cup qualifying. The return leg is on Tuesday in Diamniadio, Dakar, Senegal, but Egypt boss has laid down the gauntlet. ""I don't see any reason to be upset or sad [with our performance].¬†We just beat the African champions. In the second leg, we will defend our advantage with everything,"" Queiroz said, as per PortuGOAL.net. ""I have 44 years of experience as a coach internationally and have more than 2,000 games.¬†I am the only coach to take four countries to the World Cup and I am among the ten best coaches in the world."" Meanwhile, Egypt national team forward, Mahmoud 'Trezeguet' Hassan, said they will be motivated by the Africa Cup of Nations final loss against the Teranga Lions. ""The win [in Cairo] is a positive step towards achieving our goals, but we have a second-half in Senegal. We can win and reach the World Cup at Senegal‚Äôs expense,"" Trezeguet said. ""We were crushed after the Africa Cup of Nations final because we put in a lot of effort to reach this stage."" The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) has announced that Mahmoud Hamdy El-Wensh will travel with the team to Dakar despite being on the suspension list. El-Wensh was booked in the first half when they battled Senegal in Cairo, and the 26-year-old had received two yellow cards that came against Libya and Gabon in the previous round of qualification, so he is not eligible to play on Tuesday. ""The national team staff led by Carlos Queiroz have opted for Mahmoud Hamdy El-Wensh to remain with the team traveling to Senegal in preparation for the second leg on Tuesday despite his suspension,"" the EFA said.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifiers-egypt-queiroz-senegal-world-best/blt350077cafbf09de7,Kiplagat Sang,2ce5e6fc-d5cd-4b31-9942-3133486511c4

'Thiago took the p*ss!' - How Liverpool's Spanish maestro has got Klopp and Anfield purring,"The ovation lasted close to a minute, and no wonder. Anfield loves its footballers, and it rose to salute one of the best around on Tuesday night, as Thiago Alcantara delivered a performance to remember against Manchester United. There were plenty of things for Liverpool fans to enjoy during their side‚Äôs 4-0 win; the return to goalscoring form of Mohamed Salah, the continued brilliance of Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz or the painful, ongoing struggles of their greatest rivals, to name just a few. And yet it was Thiago who stood out, the midfielder‚Äôs class and swagger a cut above the rest. ‚ÄúHe took the p*ss,‚Äù suggested Gary Neville, the former United captain, on commentary, and it was hard to disagree. The Spaniard has been doing a lot of that of late, playing with a confidence and a sharpness that few can match, and which has supporters and pundits drooling. ""A master at work,"" posted the official Liverpool Twitter account on Friday afternoon, and you didn't need to be a genius to realise who would be in the accompanying picture.  A clip of Thiago warming up last Tuesday, posted on Instagram, had received more than 8.6m plays at the time of writing.  With his touches, his no-look passes and his ability to glide away from tackles with the grace of a ballet dancer, he is a social media editor's dream, never mind a manager's. Three days prior to the United game, Thiago had starred at Wembley as Liverpool defeated Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final. Prior to that he was one of the few Reds players to perform as the Premier League‚Äôs top two drew 2-2 at the Etihad. He has already matched his appearance total (30) from last season, and as Klopp‚Äôs side head into the final, decisive weeks of the campaign, the former Bayern Munich man looks to be peaking at exactly the right time. Not that Klopp wishes to get too excited, mind. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs great,‚Äù said the Reds boss ahead of Sunday‚Äôs Merseyside derby with Everton. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to talk too much about one player, not because the player doesn‚Äôt deserve it, but because always when we do that then something [an injury] happens with the player! ‚ÄúSo I leave this room and someone tells me ‚ÄòThiago feels a little bit here or there‚Äô. Yes, [his form] was great, now let‚Äôs carry on!‚Äù Klopp‚Äôs caution is understandable. It was, after all, a game against Everton which set Thiago back following his move to Anfield in 2020.  A tackle from Richarlison, in the final minutes of a 2-2 draw which also saw Virgil van Dijk suffer a long-term injury, would keep him sidelined for more than three months. By the time he returned, Liverpool‚Äôs Premier League title defence had begun to unravel, and not even he could fix things. That led to some harsh assessments, with Dietmar Hamann, the former Reds midfielder, one of the most vocal critics.  Hamann is no fan of Klopp, it should be said, and is a regular dissenting voice, but his suggestion that Thiago slowed Liverpool‚Äôs play down, and that he may not be suited to their all-action style, was one that was shared by more than a few fans and commentators. Klopp was incredulous when reminded of such criticism on Friday. ‚ÄúPeople were questioning if he suits our football?!‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúThank God these people don‚Äôt make decisions!‚Äù Thiago, he insisted, had only one problem following his switch from Munich. ‚ÄúHe was injured, and it started with an Everton game. But there was never a question about whether he would suit us. We only signed him because we knew he would help us. He knew he would fit in and we knew it as well.‚Äù Another ex-Red, former striker Dirk Kuyt, believes it is no coincidence that all of Liverpool‚Äôs forwards - whether it is Salah, Mane, Diaz, Diogo Jota or Roberto Firmino - have been firing of late. Having a player like Thiago, he says, means the team will always create chances. ‚ÄúAs a forward, it‚Äôs so nice when you have someone like him,‚Äù Kuyt tells GOAL. ‚ÄúYou just know you have to make the movement, run into the space and you could close your eyes and the ball will appear! That makes life really easy.‚Äù The balance of Liverpool‚Äôs midfield is something which has debated at length, even as the Reds have achieved greatness at home and abroad in recent years. It has, for some time, been seen as a potential weakness, an area to be strengthened and developed. That may still be the case, with James Milner‚Äôs contract expiring this summer, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain approaching the final year of theirs and Jordan Henderson set to celebrate his 32nd birthday in June. There is rich potential in the likes of Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott and Tyler Morton, as well as new signing Fabio Carvalho, but for now, with big trophies in sight, keeping Thiago fit and firing is vital for Klopp.  He has made only 19 starts this season. If he finishes the campaign with 26 or 27, say, then Liverpool will have gone close to getting everything they ever dreamed of. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of the best midfielders in the world,‚Äù says Kuyt. ‚ÄúYou see now that he‚Äôs comfortable, he‚Äôs enjoying his football and he fits so well with the team. ‚ÄúI played with some great midfield players, Xabi Alonso and Stevie Gerrard, and yes you can compare him to them. But for me he‚Äôs Thiago. He‚Äôs one on his own, and a joy to watch.‚Äù Anfield would certainly agree, and so would Klopp - even if he'd rather keep it to himself for the time being.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/thiago-took-the-piss-liverpool-maestro-klopp-and-anfield/blt12f361a02f8cb9f9,Neil Jones,f70d9aec-458f-4179-b627-ba043030d26b
Sudakov could play for Barcelona or Man City but instead he's in a bunker for a senseless war ‚Äì Shakhtar Donetsk reserve coach Valente,"Giorgi Sudakov has the potential to play for Barcelona or Manchester City, says Shakhtar Donetsk youth coach Fernando Valente, as the latter revealed the former is sheltering in a bunker amid the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis. Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of their neighbouring Eastern European country last month, sparking the largest theatre of conflict in Europe since WWII, necessitating the suspension of all professional leagues within Ukraine. Taking to social media, Valente paid tribute to teenager Sudakov, who made his senior breakthrough last term and is a thrice-capped Ukraine international, with the coach stating that his ""heart is broken"" that he and the rest of the country is caught up in a ""senseless war"". ""Sudakov was the most talented player I ever coached,‚Äù Valente wrote. ‚ÄúA Ukrainian international, who recently renewed his contract with Shakhtar until 2026; a wonderful human being with a little girl on the way with his wife Lisa‚Ä¶ ""They had dreams to fulfill, dreams that have been snatched away by a bunker for a senseless war. I pray for this couple and the for all the young players and friends that I made in Ukraine and who made me happy for the two years I was there. My heart is broken.‚Äù Valente further hailed his player to Portuguese agency Agnecia Lusa, adding: ‚ÄúSudakov is a lad with enormous potential, he could even play for Barcelona or Manchester City. He was the best player I coached and we have a strong relationship."" Sudakov remains one of many Ukraine stars who remain in their home country, either trapped or fighting the Russian invasion. Several others have continued to play abroad with their clubs, such as West Ham star Andriy Yarmolenko, who broke down in tears after scoring against Aston Villa at the weekend. Russia, meanwhile, remain banned from club and international competition within Europe as part of a sweeping set of sporting sanctions issued against the nation.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sudakov-barcelona-man-city-instead-bunker-senseless-war-shakhtar-/blt165cbd46d79954a1,Andrew Steel,cddd17c8-9aa9-4c62-a988-f890b17a2e8b
Mourinho moves for Zaha as Roma boss plots yet another Premier League transfer raid,"Jose Mourinho knows the Premier League about as well as any modern manager, and so it should be no surprise that he is again casting his eye towards England in his latest bid to improve Roma's squad. The target of his affections? Crystal Palace icon Wilfried Zaha. GOAL can confirm that Mourinho has instructed Roma's general manager, Tiago Pinto, to look into the possibility of signing Zaha after he was proposed to the Giallorossi as being potentially available by his agents. It is believed, however, that the Europa Conference League winners would have to sell before they could buy Zaha. Following Henrikh Mkhitaryan's departure to join Inter on a free transfer, Roma have been looking for a versatile forward who can play in many different positions across the frontline. Zaha, 29, fits that profile, having played on both flanks and centrally during a career at Palace that has seen him rack up over 150 combined goals and assists since his debut in 2010. Wilf on THAT goal against Norwich üòé#CPFC pic.twitter.com/W1yt0HBqp5 The ex-Manchester United man was previously valued at around ‚Ç¨90 million by the Eagles, but would be available for a fraction of that price now having entered the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park. One major stumbling block could come in the form of wage demands, with Serie A clubs having struggled to match the sums paid by Premier League sides in recent years. Roma would need to sell before they can even contemplate trying to prise Zaha away from Palace, but there are players who they would be willing to see move on in the shape of Carles Perez and Stephan El Shaarawy. They could also be about to sell Nicolo Zaniolo to Juventus, if the Bianconeri get their way, but Mourinho wants to bring Zaha to the Italian capital regardless of how Zaniolo's future pans out.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-zaha-roma-transfer-crystal-palace-premier-league/blta191fed88ba7b858,Gabriele Conflitti,4bc6e8a3-b854-4969-8491-5aa708d485cc
Ghana open to Salisu union ahead of World Cup on condition,"Ghana are refusing to shut the door on Mohammed Salisu ahead of the 2022 World Cup despite the Southampton defender‚Äôs hesitance to avail himself for national duty. The Black Stars are set to make a return to the global gathering after beating Nigeria on the away goals rule to book a spot in Qatar on Tuesday. Salisu has been a long target of the West Africans but his consistent rejection of call-ups has left him without an international cap despite playing top-level football since 2018. ‚ÄúIt [whether Salisu will be called for the World Cup] depends on the coach,‚Äù Ghana Football Association communications director Henry Asante Twum told Citi TV. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made overtures, about four or five times. CK Akonnor tried, he wasn‚Äôt successful, Milovan tried and he wasn‚Äôt successful. ‚Äú[Current Ghana caretaker boss Otto Addo] tried and he [Salisu] still thinks he needs time.  ‚ÄúI think we have gotten to a point where we feel we should rather focus on players who are willing and ready to play [for us] than players who are dragging their feet.‚Äù Salisu was handed a first Ghana call-up for a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against South Africa but turned down the 2019 invitation from then Black Stars coach James Kwasi Appiah. CK Akonnor, who replaced Appiah as Ghana coach in 2020, continued the quest to secure the defender‚Äôs availability for international assignments but failed, revealing Salisu made it clear he was ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù to represent the national team.  Former Ghana coach Milovan Rajevac, who led Ghana to the recent Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Cameroon, made similar comments when asked of the 22-year-old‚Äôs absence from the Black Stars.  Ahead of Ghana‚Äôs clash with Nigeria, Black Stars Management Committee member Alhaji Karim Grunsah revealed the defender was once again contacted but rejected the call.  Salisu has been in outstanding form for Southampton in the Premier League this season, making 27 appearances involving 26 starts so far. He joined The Saints in 2020 after impressing for Real Valladolid in La Liga, having reportedly turned down offers from the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid.

'I couldn't have dreamt it better' - Liverpool star Konate hoping to inspire Paris' next generation with Champions League glory,"It has already been a special week for Ibrahima Konate, and he hasn‚Äôt even reached the best part yet. On Wednesday, he celebrated his 23rd birthday, and on Saturday night he will walk out in his home city, hoping to land the biggest prize in European club football. ‚ÄúIf I tried, I couldn‚Äôt have dreamt anything better,‚Äù smiles the Liverpool defender. ‚ÄúThe Champions League final. In Paris. My home. What a story! ‚ÄúFor sure, it is definitely going to be the best moment of my life.‚Äù It is more than eight years since Konate left the French capital, pursuing a career that would take him to Sochaux, to RB Leipzig and, last year, to Liverpool. He says now that his dream is ‚Äúto be the best central defender in the world, and to win all the titles going,‚Äù but back then, as a wide-eyed 14-year-old, his ambitions were rather more modest. ‚ÄúMy dream then was just to become a professional footballer,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have an idea in my head about being at a top club or whatever. It was just about being a pro. I couldn‚Äôt look beyond that.‚Äù No saving that! üí•Ibrahima Konat√© powers home a wonderful header to give Liverpool an early lead vs Benfica ‚öΩÔ∏è#UCL pic.twitter.com/pz119aAldY What a time for Ibrahima Konat√© to score his first #UCL goal!Liverpool make the perfect start. üëå pic.twitter.com/N4PJQrLqIp One of eight children born to Malian immigrants, he had grown up in Paris‚Äô 11th arrondissement, one of Europe‚Äôs most densely populated areas. There, he would play football in the ‚Äòcages‚Äô and on the streets, sometimes with a ball made from scrunched up paper and sellotape. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have the money,‚Äù he says, matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúLike most young Parisiens, we couldn‚Äôt get to see football in proper stadiums, and we didn‚Äôt play on (proper) pitches, because we didn‚Äôt have those opportunities. ‚ÄúBut we found ways to play football whenever and wherever we could. We really didn‚Äôt need much to be happy, we were just happy playing in the streets. ‚ÄúIf it was a ball made out of foam or leather or plastic ‚Äì it would keep us busy all day. We‚Äôd play in the street, those cages, me and my brothers. That‚Äôs why, I think, we have these talents and qualities.‚Äù Konate started out as a striker. Ronaldo - the Brazilian version - was his first footballing hero. Later, at Paris FC, he would move back into midfield before, as a 17-year-old professional at Sochaux, settling into his role as a centre-back. Liverpool paid ¬£36million ($45m) to sign him from Leipzig last summer, and their investment looks a shrewd one. Konate has made 28 appearances in all competitions this season. He has already featured in two cup finals, started five out of six Champions League knockout matches, and has every chance of lining-up alongside Virgil van Dijk against Real Madrid in the Stade de France this weekend. ‚ÄúI knew that with hard work I would perform well and get game-time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I wouldn‚Äôt have bet on playing in so many big matches. ‚ÄúI never would have imagined this. I knew I was coming to a big club that wants to win titles, but this season has been exceptional. I think it‚Äôs been a historic season. I live it every day and it has been remarkable.‚Äù As he talks, Konate‚Äôs eyes are drawn towards a picture on the wall. It is of Jurgen Klopp, and in his hand is the European Cup. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop looking at it!‚Äù Konate laughs. ‚ÄúI think that with this trophy, we‚Äôre talking about games I watched on TV as a kid and grew up watching. ‚ÄúEven the final against Madrid (2018), when they lost, I watched on the tele. So it‚Äôs something that is already part of my history because I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs indescribable what it means ‚Äì I‚Äôve not got the words to explain what winning huge trophies like this one would mean. The club wants to show that they‚Äôre already part of football history, and they want to go on demonstrating that year after year. ‚ÄúSo when I think about the motto of being together [You‚Äôll Never Walk Alone], and having this history together, it is beyond words, beyond dreams.‚Äù Konate still has friends and family in Paris, of course, and he will have plenty of support inside the stadium on Saturday. He still returns to the 11th arrondissement from time to time, and sees himself as a role model for Paris‚Äô next generation of budding young sports stars. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lots of talent there, everyone knows it‚Äôs a fish pond,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúToday, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to reach this level ‚Äì but that‚Äôs not the end. ‚ÄúI hope that I‚Äôll reach even higher heights and be a source of inspiration for young people, an inspiration for more people to come from the streets of Paris into football. ‚ÄúIt would be good to think I can inspire more young players, and show it is possible.‚Äù He finishes by telling a story. Seven years ago, he says, he watched Sochaux‚Äôs Under-19 team play in the final of the Coupe Gambardella, France's version of the FA Youth. Marcus Thuram scored as they beat a Lyon side which included Maxwel Cornet.  It is Konate's only previous visit to the Stade de France. ‚ÄúIt really has been some journey, yes!‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA long, long journey! ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible to think that I was watching a match at that level from the stands just a few years ago. It was my first time there, and now I‚Äôll be on the grass, playing in a Champions League final there. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have children yet, so I can‚Äôt be sure, but I think this will be the greatest moment of my life.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-konate-inspire-paris-next-generation-champions/bltd5694ca6f5546d7e,Neil Jones,f158444f-f244-450a-9a4a-890638b82857
Rangnick responds to Austria job rumours after Man Utd draw 1-1 with Chelsea,"Manchester United coach Ralf Rangnick says he will ""definitely"" take up a consultancy role at the club next season, but stopped short of denying claims he could also take charge of Austria's national team. Reports on Thursday suggested the German manager is considering an offer to take over as Austria boss. Asked about the rumours after United drew 1-1 with Chelsea in the Premier League, Rangnick said he will stay on at Old Trafford after stepping down from his role as interim manager.  ""Let us speak tonight about Manchester United, this is the issue,"" he said to Sky Sports after the clash against Chelsea.  ""I can confIrm I will definitely continue in the consultancy role. ""So far me and Erik [ten Hag] haven't spoken. But I am more than happy and willing to help and change things for the better. ""It would leave space for another job but that is what we agreed in November last year."" The draw against Thomas Tuchel's team leaves United sixth in the Premier League table. They are five points behind Arsenal, who occupy the fourth and final spot that guarantees a place in next season's Champions League group stage. However, United have played two more matches than Arsenal and fellow contenders Tottenham, who are three points ahead of Rangnick's team. United are now winless in three matches and will take on Brentford at home on Monday, followed by a trip to Brighton.

Arsenal reveal Thomas Partey injury details as midfielder suffers muscle damage,"Arsenal have revealed that Thomas Partey suffered damage to a muscle in his right thigh during their Premier League clash against Crystal Palace on Monday. The Gunners suffered a 3-0 loss at Selhurst Park and the midfielder had to be taken off in the second half because of the injury.  Arteta admitted after the match that the midfielder's condition was a ""big concern"" after he signalled that he needed to come off. The club have since revealed that he faces at least weeks out of action and will be sent to see a specialist about the issue. ""Thomas has since received further assessments, and a subsequent scan has shown muscle damage to his right thigh,"" an update from the club read. ""We will continue to assess Thomas in the coming weeks, during which time he will also receive further specialist consultations."" The injury is just the latest in a list of issues that have flared up for Thomas since his arrival in north London. The Ghana international missed weeks of action in his first season at the club due muscle and hip problems. He was then absent for the first few weeks of the current campaign as he dealt with an ankle injury. The news comes as a big blow for the Gunners, though, as they are locked in a battle for a top-four finish. The loss to Palace on Monday leaves them level on points with Tottenham, who have the advantage in the fight for the last Champions League spot on goal difference. Spurs have won five of their last six matches in the English top-flight to put them in a strong position, while West Ham and Manchester United are just three points behind. However, Arsenal have a game in hand over their north London rivals and the Red Devils.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-reveal-thomas-partey-injury-details-as-midfielder/blt72bbd2c825c77060,By Peter McVitie,aa4f7d28-3d0a-4b1c-a3d5-417a2c351c00
Insigne explains how MLS has 'surprised' him after move from Napoli,"Lorenzo Insigne has admitted he was surprised by the quality of football in MLS upon joining Toronto FC this summer. The winger made the switch from Napoli having agreed a pre-contract earlier in the year, leaving his native Italy for the first time in his career. Insigne has revealed that he did not expect the standards to be as high as in Serie A, but he has changed his mind after getting a taste of how physical the game is in the United States. The Italy international told Rai RadioUno: ‚ÄúI was surprised by the MLS because there are all very good facilities, new pitches and very nice stadiums.¬† ‚ÄúOn a physical level it is very demanding because you run so much. It‚Äôs a good league and I hope it grows more and more to approach the prestige of the European leagues. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing well in Toronto and I‚Äôm starting to study the language.

Insigne bears no ill-feeling towards the Serie A outfit, however, and says he will remain a fan from afar. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I, Mertens, Koulibaly and also Ghoulam left together. So sorry because we have all given so much to Napoli and there is sadness, but life is like that,"" he said. ‚ÄúDefinitely all three of us will always remain attached to Napoli and we will always cheer for Napoli. ‚ÄúTo those who criticise me for leaving Serie A at just 31 years old, I have nothing to say because I am happy with the decision I made and I am moving on.‚Äù Asked about Napoli's prospects this season, Insigne added: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait for the start of the Italian season so I can follow Napoli, because I am a huge Napoli fan and I have already arranged everything to see the matches.  ‚ÄúAnd as I wished my teammates, whom I spoke to time to time through calls and messages, that I hope they win the title and I would be very happy if they did. ‚ÄúHonestly, seeing the transfer market of all the teams, I hope it will be a great season.

When will Ferran Torres make his Barcelona debut and can ‚Ç¨55m signing play against Real Madrid in El Clasico?,"Ferran Torres saw a move from Manchester City to Barcelona confirmed on December 28, but the Spain international has been forced to wait for his debut on the back of a ‚Ç¨55 million¬†(¬£46m/$62m) transfer. The 21-year-old forward has seen a number of obstacles block his path at Camp Nou, but they are starting to clear and a new chapter is about to be opened by the highly-rated youngster. Torres is raring to go for the Liga heavyweights, with GOAL taking a look at when a first appearance may be made and whether that outing could come in a Clasico clash with arch-rivals Real Madrid. Barca were investing in their present and future when putting a big-money deal for Torres in place, with the Catalans pulling off quite a coup in luring a player of considerable promise away from the reigning Premier League champions. They were, however, unable to register a new signing upon his arrival due to ongoing financial struggles. Those issues have been ironed out to some extent, with Samuel Umtiti‚Äôs willingness to sign a new contract on reduced terms allowing Torres to be officially added to Xavi‚Äôs squad. He had, however, been snapped up while nursing a foot injury picked up while on Nations League duty with Spain in October 2021. A full recovery has been made from that fracture, but Torres also recorded a positive Covid-19 test in the wake of his unveiling at Camp Nou ‚Äì forcing him to take in another enforced spell on the sidelines. With uncertainty hanging over when Torres would be available to make his debut, Barcelona initially left their expensive asset out of their travelling party for a Supercopa de Espana clash with Real Madrid. He was, however, to deliver a negative Covid test result after seeing the rest of his team-mates head for Saudi Arabia and was cleared to follow behind on a separate flight. A late fitness test will need to be passed in order to figure in Xavi‚Äôs plans against the Blancos on Wednesday, while confirmation of his registration from the Spanish FA is also required before the green light can be given. If Barca opt against throwing Torres in at the deep end during a Clasico encounter, then a delayed debut could be made in a Copa del Rey tie with Athletic Club on January 19. When he does make his debut, Torres will wear No 19, with Barca confirming the striker's squad number on Tuesday evening. ùôçùôÄùôÇùôÑùôéùôèùôÄùôçùôÄùòø !! ‚úÖ@FerranTorres20, our new N¬∫ 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£! pic.twitter.com/hQB3ctjW06 Golden Boy winner Pedri is another of those to have found himself watching on from afar at Barcelona of late. The 19-year-old has taken in just four appearances this season, with the last of those coming on September 29, 2021 in a 3-0 Champions League defeat to Benfica. A muscle problem has kept him out of action for over three months, with 19 games sat out across all competitions. He did return to training in late December, but then posted a positive Covid-19 test and was only cleared alongside Torres to join up with Barca‚Äôs squad in the Middle East after the vast majority of senior stars had already departed. One of those that was on the plane when Barca set off for Saudi Arabia was Ansu Fati, with the Blaugrana easing another player of considerable promise back into their plans. The 19-year-old forward, who has registered four goals in eight appearances this season, has been out of action since November with a troublesome hamstring complaint. He is yet to be fully cleared for a return to competitive football, but he has been involved in Xavi‚Äôs pre-match preparations ahead of a showdown with Real that could move Barca a step closer to securing more major silverware.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-ferran-torres-barcelona-debut-55m-signing-real-madrid/blt42ade37b0f7fc002,Chris Burton,d031c96b-3b24-48fd-b30b-b9a955eddf5e
Barcelona eliminated from Champions League group stage for first time in 21 years,"Barcelona signed off on their worst Champions League campaign in two decades on Wednesday, as another comprehensive defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich sealed elimination at the group stage. The Catalans went into their final game battling Benfica for the second qualifying spot in Group E and knowing they might well need to chase a result in the Allianz Arena.  But Bayern barely broke sweat in taking apart Xavi's men, while the Portuguese side took the necessary three points to send them to the last 16 as runners-up behind Bayern.  Following November's 0-0 draw with Benfica, Barca were technically ahead of their rivals on points before kick-off on Wednesday but also at a grave disadvantage.  Victory for the Lisbon club over Dynamo Kyiv would mean the Blaugrana had no choice to win away to Bayern, who had already taken them apart 3-0 at Camp Nou and were on course to record a perfect six wins out of six.  Benfica duly suffered few problems in dispatching Dynamo 2-0, while goals from Thomas Muller, Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala ended Barca's hopes as Bayern romped to a 3-0 win.  4 - Barcelona has been knocked out from a Champions League group stage for the fourth time ever, the first one since 2000/01 when they played the UEFA Cup.

"Ligue 1 Wrap: Dembele bags brace as Boulaya, Mendy, Cho, and Bayo score","Moussa Dembele was on target twice as Olympique Lyon bowed 3-2 to Metz in Sunday‚Äôs Ligue 1 outing. Having failed to win any of their last 14 matches in the French top flight, the Maroons silenced ten-man Kids to keep their survival hopes alive. Although Lyon began the game on a very bright note, the hosts took the lead in the 26th minute through Vincent Pajot. Nicolas de Preville‚Äôs corner kick was flicked on by Lenny Lacroix to Pajot, who scored his first goal for the club with a superb first-time volley. Five minutes before the half-time break, Didier Lamkel Ze doubled the lead with a deft finish over goalkeeper Anthony Lopes after receiving a fine pass from Pape Matar Sarr. Two minutes later, Dembele reduced the deficit after he was teed up by Tete. The Mali prospect‚Äôs effort was ruled out for offside only for the decision to be overturned following a VAR review. The ambition of Peter Bosz‚Äôs men to restore parity suffered a massive setback in the 68th minute as Thiago Mendes was given his marching orders for serious foul play against Lamkel Ze. Despite numerical disadvantage, Lyon levelled matters in the 84th minute as Dembele completed his double thanks to an assist from Karl Toko Ekambi. Metz claimed all points at stake as Farid Boulaya rifled in a third goal in stoppage time to secure a famous win. The result moves the Maroons off the bottom of the table in 19th, while Lyon‚Äôs hopes of playing European football next season are almost over, as they are now five points adrift of fifth-place Strasbourg in the Uefa Europa Conference League place. At the Stade Raymond Kopa, former France youth international of Bissau-Guinean descent Batista Mendy, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire and Morocco prospect Mohamed-Ali Cho and Stephane Bahoken were on song as Angers trounced Bordeaux 4-1. The result leaves the Girondins on the brink of relegation to Ligue 2, as they sit four points adrift of the relegation play-off spot with two matches left to play.¬† Whereas, the Black and Whites moved to 14th, seven points clear of 18th-placed St. Etienne.In another fixture, Guinea international Mohamed Bayo was Clermont Foot‚Äôs hero as they silenced Montpellier 2-1 at the Stade Gabriel Montpied.¬† Despite only losing once in their last 19 away games against newly-promoted sides in Ligue 1, La Paillade‚Äôs pitiable form in 2022 continues to hamper them.¬† While they are mathematically safe from relegation, a frightening 11 defeats away from home this year is the most of any team currently in the French top-flight.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ligue-1-wrap-dembele-bags-brace-as-boulaya-mendy-cho-and/blt0982fab2fef718d4,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,0181ff4d-6b9d-4280-a07e-650680c3a3c1

Thalys: Palmeiras' new Rivaldo who tore up the CEE Cup,"Palmeiras are the team in Brazil to whom all others aspire right now. Copa Libertadores winners in both 2020 and 2021, they currently sit atop their domestic leagues at both senior and Under-20s level, with that same youth team having won the prestigious Copinha earlier this year. Theirs is a success that has been built at home, too, with the recent crop of Palmeiras academy products set to be littered around Europe's biggest clubs over the next few years. Two-time NXGN nominee Gabriel Veron flew the nest earlier this summer, joining Porto in an initial ‚Ç¨10 million (¬£8.4m/$10.2m) deal, and the likes of Gabriel Menino, Danilo and Giovani will not be far behind him in leaving the Verdao. Even younger players, such as electric 16-year-old Endrick and his attacking partner in crime, Luis Guilherme, are already being linked with mega-money moves to the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona. Neither Endrick or Guilherme, however, were part of the Palmeiras U19s squad that made the trip to Prague to compete in the 2022 CEE Cup, the prestigious annual youth tournament held in the Czech Republic. But in a show of strength in depth, Palmeiras ran out victors regardless, scoring 14 goals in just three games to claim the trophy for the third successive time. The star of their campaign was attacking midfielder Thalys, who finished as the competition's joint-top scorer with three goals and was named the NXGN Player of the Tournament. Though his exploits in front of goal took the headlines after he netted the winner in Palmeiras' 2-1 victory over Slavia Prague in the final, it was Thalys' all-round game that really stood out. Notionally an attacking midfielder, the 17-year-old is comfortable playing in a number of different roles, including as a false nine and off the right, where he can cut inside onto his favoured left foot. He glides past opponents while maintaining close control with ease, his tall, slender frame harking back to one of Palmeiras' greatest ever players, Rivaldo. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: We are, however, only six years on from Thalys almost giving up on the game all together. His father died when he was just four, and by the age of 11, he was ready to quit football so as to ease the burden on his mother. She, though, pushed her son to continue following his dreams and, in April 2021, that dream took a further step towards reality as he was enrolled into the Palmeiras academy. Thalys, who at the time was playing in the youth system of second division side Clube de Regatas Brasil, enchanted Palmeiras' scouts with the way he manipulated the ball in possession and picked out passes to his team-mates, and he was soon invited to move to Sao Paulo. He has packed plenty into his first 15 months at the club, too. Thalys scored seven goals in his first season with the U17s, before following that up with eight goals in just 11 games the following campaign as he began to force his way into the U20s squad. In 2022 alone he has been named the Player of the Tournament at the FAM Cup, an annual U17s competition in Brazil, and scored seven goals as Palmeiras won the U17s Brazilian Cup, with Thalys netting a stunning volley in their final win over Vasco da Gama. Now with yet more individual honours tucked away following his displays at the CEE Cup, Thalys has eyes on the future. ""I dream of playing in the Palmeiras first team and one day play at the World Cup with Brazil,"" he tells NXGN, while going onto explain that Neymar is hero because ""he plays happily, he is always smiling, and this is the Brazilian style"". Thalys certainly seems to have taken up that Brazilian style, both in his personality and the way he plays his football. Now, he can focus on becoming the latest gem of the Palmeiras academy to become a superstar.

Ferran Torres: I'd kidnap Dembele to keep him at Barcelona!,"Ferran Torres has joked that he would kidnap team-mate Ousmane Dembele in order to keep him at Barcelona. The Frenchman's contract with the Blaugrana is set to run out in the summer, with talks ongoing over an extension. Negotiations are still some way off reaching a conclusion, but both the club and Dembele are keen to remain together for the foreseeable future. One of Dembele's attacking partners in crime, Ferran Torres, is among those who would love for the winger to stay at Camp Nou. Ahead of Barca's Europa League clash with Eintracht Frankfurt, the Spain international said: ‚ÄúI would kidnap him in Barcelona! It's a good club, one of the best in the world. ‚ÄúBut there are things that are none of our business. It's his decision. Whatever he decides, I wish him all the best.‚Äù Ousmane Dembele is breathing new life into his Barcelona career üòç pic.twitter.com/rkwuROcltW GOAL revealed on Tuesday that Barca sporting director Mateu Alemany flew to Morocco to meet with Dembele's agent and reopen contract talks. No financial particulars were discussed, however, with both parties merely having agreed to a clean slate after months of fruitless back and forth demands. News of a fresh start for both parties comes as good news to head coach Xavi, who has been talking up Dembele's talents as the post-Lionel Messi rebuild continues. ‚ÄúI hope he can stay with us,"" he told reporters. ‚ÄúI have already said it and I have no problem repeating it again. He can be the best in the world in his position. The club is working for the present and the future. ‚ÄúOusmane is an important footballer and I hope he decides to stay. I'd sign his new contract immediately.

Yaser Asprilla: Colombia wonderkid out to conquer the Premier League at Watford,"Stepping up from South American football to one of Europe's 'Big Five' leagues is a stern challenge, even for the most talented young players. Ability is not always enough to make it at the elite level: a potential star also needs self-belief, and plenty of it. Fortunately, that does not seem to be a virtue lacking in Watford's new signing, 18-year-old Colombia international Yaser Asprilla, who is already looking to surpass his namesake Faustino (no relation), perhaps the nation's most successful export to the English top flight. ‚ÄúThe way I'm going, humbly, I think I am going to be better than him,‚Äù Yaser announced to the world shortly after signing terms for the Hornets from Envigado, in a bold statement that quickly went viral. ‚ÄúI believe in my characteristics and in my talent. I know this is going to be a great experience, in this most beautiful of careers playing football.‚Äù Watford certainly believe they have a gem on their hands. The Premier League strugglers agreed a price of around ¬£2.5 million ($3.4m) for Asprilla back in August, when he had played less than 10 senior games in the Liga Di Mayor for Envigado. The teenager went on to stand out as one of the revelations of the 2021 season, netting five goals in 19 games as his side secured a respectable ninth-placed finish, just missing out on the play-offs. A tiny club located on the outskirts of Medellin, Envigado are rarely, if ever, involved in the fight for honours in Colombia. Their speciality rather is to groom the latest generation of talent, something they do better than most. Asprilla is just the latest graduate of a youth academy which in recent years has produced stars such as James Rodriguez, Juan Fernando Quintero, Giovanni Moreno, Mateus Uribe and Fredy Guarin, among others who have made their name on either side of the Atlantic Ocean. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Born in Bajo Baudo on Colombia's Pacific coast, wiry forward Asprilla was just 11 when he made the move to Envigado, and he soon stood out with his deadly left foot and precocious technical ability with the ball at his feet. The youngster feels most comfortable directing play from an advanced midfield position, while he has also featured out wide for Envigado on both flanks. Given his proficiency around goal and impressive physical stature, though, he could well find himself fitting in further up the field, playing just off the centre-forward and creating havoc in and around the area. Those closest to Asprilla are in no doubt they have a unique asset on their hands. ‚ÄúYaser is a special player; we hadn't seen players with Faustino Asprilla's style for a while, since now they are more athletic and less skilful,‚Äù Alberto Suarez, who coached Asprilla in the club's youth ranks, explained to Blu Radio following his full international debut on January 16 against Honduras. ‚ÄúHe is a typical old-school player who knows how to play with his body. Against Honduras, he delighted us and made us proud because he showed what he always did at Envigado. Yaser will have football in him for a long time. ‚ÄúWhat makes him special? He plays while thinking. He doesn't just play with his feet, but also with his body. ""When I spoke to [Colombia coach] Reinaldo Rueda, he asked me about his physical condition and body weight; he is slim, but you try and kick him because he knows how to use his body, so to stop him you have to push or grab him, but kicking him is very tough for opponents.‚Äù Just where Asprilla - who will hope to see more international game-time in Tuesday's make-or-break World Cup qualifier against Argentina - will exercise his undoubted potential for the immediate future remained unclear through January. It remains unknown whether he will be eligible for a UK work permit, and it was thought that Watford would choose to let him pursue precious first-team football on loan for the rest of the season, with Envigado, Colombian rivals Deportivo Cali and the Hornets' sister club Udinese cited as possible destinations. But with transfer deadline day in Europe having come and gone, he remains part of the Watford squad, and so it will be interesting to see exactly where he lands once his international commitments are over. He has already picked up one valuable seal of approval though, with ex-Newcastle United, Parma and Colombia ace Asprilla backing him to follow in his footsteps and make a big impression in England. ‚ÄúI think it's great,‚Äù 'Tino' remarked to Blog Deportivo when asked about the youngster's comments. ‚ÄúHe shouldn't just think about me, but a lot of players who were even better than me. I hope he can overtake us all because that's good for football and the Colombia team. ‚ÄúIf he plays well, he must be a relative of mine. If he plays badly, he isn't!‚Äù For more on the world's best young ballers, follow NXGN on Instagram and TikTok.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/yaser-asprilla-colombia-wonderkid-conquer-premier-league/blt8c24555609b90a8b,Daniel Edwards,1228a18d-cc9e-4d05-a7a0-51018fe9bd96
"'It was his game, he could be Divock Origi - Klopp full of praise for 'top striker' after another last-gasp goal","Liverpool striker Divock Origi praised his side's never-say-die attitude after helping them clinch victory over Wolves with a last-gasp strike on Saturday.  The forward came off the bench to score the only goal of the game at Molineux Stadium, finally breaking the hosts' stubborn resistance.  Victory put the Reds briefly top of the Premier League after rivals Chelsea were defeated by West Ham, though Manchester City's win later in the evening sent Pep Guardiola's side past them. ""I think that ties in with the values of the club ‚Äì keep believing, keep going,"" Origi told Liverpool's official website after the game.  ""In the end you can only control the moment you are in and just try to make the right play every time again, even if you fail again and again. Manager Jurgen Klopp was also delighted to see his supersub come through again for the team.  ""He is an incredible finisher and if we don‚Äôt know it at Liverpool then who should know it. It is difficult to get 500 minutes a week in the team we have,"" he said to reporters. ""He doesn‚Äôt need a lot of run up. It was his game, he could be Divock Origi. He was unlucky with the ball before. This kind of goals we see plenty of times, in training. Winning in the 95th minute is great but Div scores it is even better."" Klopp continued: ""Top striker, top boy. That is how it is. He has scored some of the most important goals in the history of this club."" Saturday's victory extended Liverpool's winning streak to four games in the Premier League, while only West Ham have managed to get the better of Jurgen Klopp's men in any competition so far in 2021-22.  With the Hammers also beating Chelsea 3-2 at the weekend, the Reds leapfrogged the Londoners to go one point clear of the Blues.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-keep-believing-origi-says-club-values-lifted-reds/blt74312e4c279bfb0a,GOAL,b80c1bfa-1ecc-4456-add9-e22a58314b2b
Watch: Sublime Morgan flick sets USWNT on their way to opening CONCACAF W Championship victory over Haiti,"Alex Morgan hit a brace as the United States women's national team saw off Haiti in their opening CONCACAF W Championship fixture on Monday. Morgan was the star as the USWNT began their group-stage campaign in strong fashion, with Margaret Purce also managing to get her name on the scoresheet late on. Vlatko Andonovski's side are now well on their way to reaching the knockout stages, which would also see them qualify for the 2023 World Cup.

The USWNT doubled their advantage when Morgan headed home seven minutes later, while Haiti squandered the chance to get back into the game just before the interval as Roselord Borgella missed a penalty.

How Manchester United have wasted ¬£1 billion on transfer signings since Ferguson's retirement,"Manchester United have spent more than ¬£1 billion ($1.2bn) in transfer fees since Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äôs retirement in 2013, with Erik ten Hag now embarking on the latest squad overhaul this summer. The Dutchman has already recruited Lisandro Martinez and Tyrell Malacia for a combined ¬£62m ($75m), with Christian Eriksen arriving as a free agent.  More money will likely be spent before the close of the summer transfer window, with Ten Hag hoping to sign Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and Ajax winger Antony to strengthen a squad that has made an embarrassing start to the new Premier League season. It is staggering that United remain a club in crisis, given how cash has been splashed over the past nine years.  Indeed, once performance-related add-ons are factored in, their base outlay on recruitment currently stands at ¬£1.008bn ($1.218bn) on 42 different players. And it is a measure of their spending post-Ferguson that not one of his signings feature in their 15 most expensive transfers.  More importantly, it is a sign of the amount of money wasted over the span of nearly a decade without the Premier League title ‚Äì and five years since they last won a trophy.  New chief executive Richard Arnold has to end that period of shambolic transfer dealings ‚Äì and the mantra of his first summer window has been to spend wisely.  Only time will tell how United‚Äôs latest reboot works out but, as this list proves, money is no guarantee of success...",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/manchester-united-wasted-billion-transfer-signings-ferguson/blt1dfdc17d3bccd233,James Robson,9bd70453-8762-4be2-aae2-123c619d32c0
Watch: USWNT book spot in Olympics as Morgan penalty kick seals win over Canada in CONCACAF W Championship final,"The U.S. women's national team missed chance after chance on Monday night in the CONCACAF W Championship final, but Alex Morgan eventually came up with the goal they needed to seal a spot in the Olympics. After missing several opportunities to seize momentum against Canada, Morgan scored from the spot in the 78th minute, sealing a 1-0 win that saw the U.S. take the top spot in CONCACAF for the ninth time. With the win, the U.S. qualify for the 2024 Olympics, having already booked a spot in the 2023 World Cup earlier in the tournament. HOW COOL CAN YOU BE, @ALEXMORGAN13 üòÆ‚Äçüí® pic.twitter.com/XCMXWaF8oh The USWNT were nearly made to pay for a slew of missed opportunities as the tournament favourites let their northern rivals hang around thanks to some wayward chances. The U.S. outshot and out-possessed Canada, generating several clear-cut chances to take the lead.  Until Morgan's late spot kick, though, those chances weren't converted, with the most glaring being Sophia Smith's miss in the 64th minute after rounding goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan. SOPHIA SMITH MISSES AN OPEN NET FOR THE USWNT. üò± pic.twitter.com/n8JOqviUXF The penalty was earned by Rose Lavelle, who was dragged down in the box in what ultimately proved to be the game's decisive sequence. With the tournament triumph, the U.S. qualifies for both the Olympics and the World Cup as they look to regain their place atop the women's game. Canada will also be World Cup-bound, but will now need to face third-place finisher Jamaica for an Olympic berth. Jamaica defeated Costa Rica 1-0 earlier on Monday, with Kalyssa Van Zanten scoring in the 102nd minute to keep her country's hopes of a spot in France alive. With three goals, Morgan finished with the joint-most in the tournament, level with Canada's Jesse Flemming and Julia Grosso as well as Jamaica's Khadija Shaw. With the trophy in hand, the USWNT can now look ahead to friendlies later on in the year.

Odegaard & Smith Rowe out as Arsenal's preparations for Liverpool Carabao Cup test plunged into disarray,"Arsenal look set to be without both Martin Odegaard and Emile Smith Rowe for their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Liverpool. Smith Rowe missed Sunday‚Äôs FA Cup defeat at Nottingham Forest due to a groin issue and it is believed he has not recovered in time to make the trip to Anfield. And GOAL has learned that Odegaard, who started at the City Ground, is now also set to miss out - plunging Mikel Arteta‚Äôs preparations for Thursday night's game into further disarray. Odegaard has been a key player for Arsenal in recent weeks, with his performances in December earning him a Premier League Player of the Month award for December. Such has been the level of his performances, that he has kept Smith Rowe out of the team, despite the 21-year-old being Arsenal‚Äôs top goalscorer this season. But it is understood the Norway international was unable to report for training on Thursday at London Colney and was not part of the travelling squad which set off for Liverpool. With both playmakers expected to be out, Arteta must decide whether to stick with his favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, or potentially switch to a different system in their absence. Arsenal are also expected to be without right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu once again, who has been struggling with a calf problem. The Japan international missed Sunday‚Äôs defeat in Nottingham, with Cedric Soares deputising at right-back. Granit Xhaka looks set to be available, however, after ending his isolation period following a positive test for Covid-19. It would be a major boost to Arteta to have the Switzerland international available, given both Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny are away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/odegaard-smith-rowe-out-arsenal-blow-liverpool-carabao-cup/bltcbc1e05c5a6128cf,Charles Watts,bf1f376b-fb3f-41a7-a58f-f439c2cacc0d
Barcelona agree ‚Ç¨50m transfer for Lewandowski as Kahn admits Bayern Munich are prepared to sell,"Barcelona have finally reached an agreement with Bayern Munich that will see them sign Robert Lewandowski for a reported ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$50m). The prolific Poland striker has been a top target for Barca since the spring, when it first emerged that he could be looking to leave the German champions. Bayern have stood firm with their demands for the two-time winner of the FIFA The Best award, with there still 12 months left to run on his contract at the Allianz Arena, but a deal has now been put in place that suits all parties. Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn told Bild: ‚ÄúIn the end, Barcelona offered a sum that selling him made absolute sense for us. ‚ÄúWe've also recently been very successful on the transfer market and signed an absolutely world-class player for the offence in Sadio Mane. So we have now reached an agreement with Barcelona. So far, however, only verbally, the contract is still pending.‚Äù Robert Lewandowski has spoken üíî pic.twitter.com/LSR5NehgTQ Bayern then published an update on their website about the deal with Barcelona, with Kahn saying: ""We know very well what we have to thank Robert for, but great players have also left FC Bayern in the past, and even after that, Bayern's world did not fall apart. On the contrary, it often continued with even more success."" President Herbert Hainer said in an interview with¬†Bayerischer Rundfunk: ""It's good for both sides that we have clarity. Robert has earned our appreciation, he has won everything with us. We are incredibly grateful to him."" Sports director Hasan Salihamidzic told the Bayern website: ""Robert Lewandowski has done great things for FC Bayern. We spoke at length with our colleagues from Barcelona and clarified the details. He said farewell this morning.  ""After our trip to the USA, he'll come back one more time and we'll have a coffee together. We wish him every success at his new club."" That contract has seemingly been agreed between Lewandowski and Barca, with the striker set to sign on for an initial three years in Catalunya. The deal to take him to Barca will see the Spanish side pay an initial ‚Ç¨45m, with ‚Ç¨5m due in potential add-ons. The Blaugrana already have plenty of firepower in their ranks, with summer signing Raphinha joining an attacking unit that includes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres. Barca are, however, forever in the market for the best talent available and an opportunity to acquire Lewandowski is too good to pass up. He may now be 33 years of age, but he remains one of the most fearsome frontmen on the planet. A remarkable strike rate at Bayern has seen him plunder 344 goals through 375 appearances, while playing a leading role in eight Bundesliga title triumphs and a Champions League win. That considerable experience is now set to be added to the ranks at Camp Nou, with Xavi preparing to work with another all-time great. Barca are preparing to head to America for the start of their pre-season programme, with Lewandowski set to join them there once the formalities of his move have been completed.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-50m-transfer-lewandowski-kahn-bayern-munich-sell/blt945ec3d0d9569981,Chris Burton,037125fb-7a21-4cc5-b9c9-b8fdbf755ec8

 Chelsea boss Tuchel denies Abramovich exit could also force him out amid Man Utd rumours,"Thomas Tuchel has shut down suggestions he could follow outgoing Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, with the German insisting he is happy at Stamford Bridge. The former Paris Saint-Germain boss took the reins midway through last season from club legend Frank Lampard and masterminded a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for the Blues, capped with Champions League glory. Abramovich is set to sell the club amid the escalation of the Ukraine-Russia crisis, with rumours circling that Tuchel could follow him and instead head to Manchester United as Ralf Rangnick's successor - but the coach has brushed off such talk. ""I hope I made it very clear that I am very happy where I am,"" Tuchel said. ""My first talks were with Marina [Granovskaia] and Petr [Cech] and still my talks are with these two, who are the representatives and most decisive people in the club apart from the owner.

I see for me personally no reason to enter any thoughts even of losing that. ""It is not finished here, by far not finished and it just started and is so promising, we have a strong group and a strong club."" The German has quickly written his name in club history and stressed his happiness, adding: ""Sometimes in life and in professional life you need the luck to enter an environment where you feel yourself comfortable and everybody else feels comfortable with you.

'If he's not good it's because he's fat' - Payet reveals he lost 1.5kg as he responds to 'overweight' critics,"Dimitri Payet says he has lost 1.5 kilograms in weight as he hit back at the regular criticism over his fitness. The former West Ham forward is a key player in Marseille's push for Europe this season, however, he has often been criticised for being overweight and lacking discipline. Payet says criticism of his lifestyle is often unfair, and he has been spurred on by the brickbats to lose a significant amount of weight and keep himself in peak condition. Payet told RMC: ""I don't know how to take it. Currently I'm 1.5 kg less than the times we were talking about. ""It has often been the lightning rod, to say 'if he's not good, it's because he's fat'. Honestly, it didn't affect me more than that.  ""When it's not going right in your head, usually the legs don't follow. I think it was more of that than a real weight problem."" Capable of moments of remarkable quality both in the Premier League and Ligue 1, Payet is often viewed as an enigma who has not always reached his full potential due to poor attitude and fitness trouble. Payet himself disagrees, however, and said: ""Over time I have gained in consistency but that may have taken a long time to arrive. Yes, there have been ups and downs but it's like that for a lot of players. Maybe a little less with the big players but it's something for which I have taken a long time to fix. ""I'm not someone who lives in regret. I think if I had the career I had, I deserved it. There may have been an opportunity or two to go play higher, but I made a choice that was more family-oriented and wiser. For me, the most important thing is to be happy in my personal life. For everyone around me to be happy, I had to come back to Marseille."" Responding to critics who say he does not produce enough in the biggest matches, Payet admitted: ""That was the case, that was the case for a long time. Because I had an apprehension in approaching these big games. I didn't take the criticism badly because when it's the truth as a player, you know it when you're good or not.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fat-payet-lost-1-5kg-overweight-critics-marseille/blt7f6311a690943584,Emma Smith,8acba488-bad7-4a9e-baa9-16c36b03afee
'Sometimes you have to sell' - Guardiola accepts Bernardo Silva could still make Barcelona transfer move,"Pep Guardiola says he is uncertain about Bernardo Silva‚Äôs future amid interest from Barcelona in the Manchester City midfielder. Silva has been a crucial player for Man City in helping them win four titles in the last five years but wanted to leave at the start of the previous season. Despite the financial problems at Camp Nou, the Spanish giants have indicated they are interested in Bernardo but may have to sell midfielder Frenkie De Jong to free up space and money before a deal can be completed. Guardiola insists he wants him to stay but will let him leave if the move is right for the Portuguese player. The City boss has already sold senior players Oleksandr Zinchenko, Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling in the summer and says he wants players that are happy in his squad.  ‚ÄúSometimes you have to sell,‚Äù he told his news conference ahead of the Premier League opener against West Ham on Sunday. ‚ÄúFor the desire for the players, I need people happy here, we try to do it together.  ‚ÄúI would love for Bernardo to continue here, a very special player in the locker room, but I don't know what will happen.  ‚ÄúWhat happens will happen, if he stays is perfect, if he has to leave it's because football is like this.

I'm a small part of the club, I have to speak to the club, they decide and I say okay.‚Äù  Barca‚Äôs interest will depend on the shape and size of their squad going into the final days of the window as they also face the difficulty of registering players due to Liga regulations.  The club president Joan Laporta was coy on interest in Bernardo when asked but says the club will work on deals right up until the August 31 deadline day.  Guardiola says he talks regularly with the 27-year-old and there remains no doubts that he will remain committed on the pitch.  City are still looking to bring in a left-back after allowing Zinchenko to join Arsenal but first choice target Marc Cucurella is now set to leave Brighton for Chelsea.  Guardiola says there has been no movement on a new signing but says he is happy for the club to walk away from targets.  ‚ÄúThere are a lot of players around the world, most can fit perfectly in the way we are as a team,‚Äù he added.  ‚ÄúThe transfers are always difficult, maybe selling is more difficult than buying but at the same time there is an idea that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It sometimes can be possible.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-bernardo-silva-barcelona-transfer/blt137bad3b15096789,Jonathan Smith,e60beb6d-a5e0-4dcf-9ca7-9cf4db6a1024
Man Utd confirm Ronaldo‚Äôs absence from pre-season tour as Portuguese superstar pushes for transfer,"Manchester United have confirmed that ‚Äúa family issue‚Äù will prevent Cristiano Ronaldo from forming part of their pre-season plans in Thailand and Australia, with Erik ten Hag naming a 31-man touring squad that does not include the Portuguese superstar. GOAL learned on Thursday that the five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner - who continues to push for a summer transfer away from Old Trafford - would not be involved in the first fixtures of the new manager‚Äôs regime. It is understood that United have no intention of sanctioning a switch for their prized asset, despite his desire to go chasing trophies elsewhere, but they will be without the services of an all-time great when stepping up their preparations for the 2022-23 campaign. The Red Devils have said when announcing their travel plans on the club‚Äôs official website: ‚ÄúCristiano Ronaldo will not be in the party departing for Thailand as he has been granted additional time off to deal with a family issue. ‚ÄúDefender Phil Jones is following a specialist pre-season programme, as was the case last summer, to ensure he is best prepared for the campaign ahead. Brandon Williams, back from a loan spell at Norwich City, has a small issue and so is continuing to work at Carrington. ‚ÄúAndreas Pereira is being afforded a break following his recent exertions in Brazil, on loan with Flamengo.‚Äù Manchester United confirm Cristiano Ronaldo will not be on their preseason tour as he has been granted additional time off to deal with a family issue. pic.twitter.com/sxHD1tX2WD While some senior professionals are missing from Ten Hag‚Äôs ranks, a number of youngsters and recent loanees are being given an opportunity to catch the eye.

Who is Arsenal captain in 2022-23 & who has previously worn the armband for the Gunners?,"Just 12 men have filled the role of club captain at Arsenal during the Premier League era, with a notable roll of honour featuring illustrious names such as Tony Adams, Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie and current coach Mikel Arteta. Various other players have filled an on-field leadership post at times, with the armband having been passed around at Emirates Stadium following the January departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but few can claim to have enjoyed the honour of being permanent skipper. Another big call in that department has been made ahead of the 2022-23 campaign, as the Gunners look to establish consistency and stability on and off the pitch, but who are the contenders to get that nod? GOAL takes a look... Arsenal announced on July 30 that Martin Odegaard had been appointed as the club's new captain. The 23-year-old only joined the Gunners in 2021 although has made a big impact during his time in England and Mikel Arteta has decided to reward him with the armband. With Aubameyang being stripped of captaincy duties in December 2021 following a breach of club discipline, Arsenal needed somebody else to lead from the front. Alexandre Lacazette took on that responsibility on a regular basis since seeing a fellow frontman offloaded to Barcelona in the winter transfer window, but he left for Lyon in the summer, leaving a gap to fill. Martin Odegaard Martin Odegaard is magic üé© pic.twitter.com/at3wye7Wp2 With Lacazette having moved on, Martin Odegaard became a go-to option when it came to wearing the prestigious armband. The Norwegian playmaker is already captain of his country and had suggested that he would welcome an opportunity to become full-time skipper in north London. Odegaard has told TV2: ‚ÄúIt's big, of course, but it does not change much. I feel like I'm doing the same things. ‚ÄúThere are more people around who think about it. But it is a great recognition and a great declaration of trust. I take that as a big compliment, but beyond that I do the same as always.‚Äù Kieran Tierney The 2021-22 campaign was another frustrating one for Scottish full-back Kieran Tierney, with surgery required on a knee problem that has kept him out of action since the end of March. He remains a reliable selection choice for Arteta when fit, though, and would've appeared to have been a popular appointment among Arsenal fans were he have to have been called forward to take on the captaincy role. Arteta has previously said of Tierney‚Äôs ability to lead by example: ‚ÄúI think he can be Arsenal captain as he has the respect and admiration of every member of the staff and every player. It is just the way he is. He does it in a natural way. ‚ÄúHe is a really shy boy as well but he represents all of us in the club; all of the values that we want to instil and are in the DNA in this club.‚Äù Granit Xhaka Granit Xhaka's relationship with Arsenal fans is crazy üòÖ pic.twitter.com/4ljwzkL3wb Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka would've completed a remarkable turnaround with the Gunners were he to have been appointed as permanent skipper ahead of the new season. The combative 29-year-oldfilled that role once before, but was demoted in November 2019 following a very public outburst against Arsenal supporters as he was booed from the field during a meeting with Crystal Palace. He has worked his way back into favour since then and told Sky Sports when asked about taking the armband for a second time: ‚ÄúI will never say never. I was not ready for that again. ‚ÄúA captain of Arsenal can be without an armband and I am trying to lead the game and the players without the armband, but if tomorrow someone from the football club comes and asks if I want to take it I will be here because I know I am ready again to do it.‚Äù Aaron Ramsdale Aaron Ramsdale is now a full England international and first choice between the sticks, with the confident character have previously stated that he would be happy to become skipper if asked. He told FourFourTwo: ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôd take the responsibility but that‚Äôs down to the manager. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a lot of strong characters, though, and a lot of people who I think would be good captains. ‚ÄúJust to be told 'you‚Äôre in a leadership role' ‚Äì I‚Äôd relish whatever.

'Playing against Messi feels like meeting the Pope!' - Gladbach's Kramer reflects on battles with ex-Barcelona superstar,"Christoph Kramer has compared facing Lionel Messi to his meeting with the Pope, with the Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder hailing the chances he has had to play against the Argentine. The Paris Saint-Germain forward, a six-time Ballon d'Or winner, is considered one of the game's all-time greats, with plenty of his peers frequently queuing up to lavish praise upon him. Gladbach midfielder Kramer has faced the attacker on several occasions, including in the Brazil 2014 World Cup Final, and has admitted that he has an image of the two facing off as his social media icon, such is the respect he has for the veteran attacker. ""This will always be my WhatsApp profile picture, the best moment I've played football my whole career,"" Kramer told DAZN, in reference to his on-field encounter with the Argentine. ""Everyone wants to win a tackle against Messi, but nobody really manages to do it. ‚ÄúI would have liked to have spoken with him, but I had too much respect to build up the conversation and I don‚Äôt know what language to speak! ""I have to say - and I only had a feeling like that when I met the Pope - there's something awesome about him standing face-to-face."" The former Germany international faced the Argentine in back-to-back seasons in the Champions League with Bayer Leverkusen, in 2015, and with Gladbach, in 2016, drawing the former and losing the latter. But their most well-documented encounter remains the 2014 World Cup Final, when the former was a last-gasp call-up into the starting XI against La Albiceleste. Kramer was forced off through injury half-an-hour in, but left with a winners' medal after Germany triumphed, denying Messi the one major honour of his career that continues to elude him.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/playing-messi-feels-like-meeting-pope-gladbach-kramer-battles-ex-/blt0cf14c752acc1235,Andrew Steel,95b8ae45-e6e7-4e85-96b0-75ebea5f397f
"Saul can still be important for Chelsea, says Tuchel, amid reports midfielder will be sent back to Atletico Madrid","Thomas Tuchel has insisted that Saul Niguez can still be important for Chelsea amid reports the on-loan midfielder will be sent back to Atletico Madrid. Saul completed a season-long loan move to Chelsea from Atletico in the summer, with a ¬£30 million ($41m) buy-option included in the final deal. The 27-year-old has since struggled to adapt to life at Stamford Bridge and it has been suggested that he could return to Wanda Metropolitano six months early, but Tuchel has jumped to his defence. Saul has been restricted to just 13 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea to date, including only seven as a starter. However, the Spaniard produced an impressive turn in Saturday's 5-1 FA Cup third-round win against Chesterfield, and Tuchel is confident he will continue to improve. Saul Niguez is only just getting started at Chelsea üí™ pic.twitter.com/52gr5wxrcj ""I think he will be an important player for us and I hope so as well,"" Tuchel told Chelsea's official website. ""The game against Tottenham was a huge step forward for Saul and he showed what he can do with his abilities. ""Against Chesterfield, he was part of a strong squad. Okay, it was against a fifth division side so there was no need for us to be overrun in midfield but he still did well with his performance. ""I see more confidence in him with each game, he is in good shape and his adaptation to the way we play has gone further from before. ""You can see this in his game now. He is more open, he understands the language better now and these are all important things to consider when talking about Saul and how much he has improved recently. ""He is having much more impact on games than he was doing at the beginning of the season and this is very important because I‚Äôm convinced we will need every player to compete in every competition from now until the end of the season, especially at the moment where we are playing every three days."" Tuchel also discussed the availability of Thiago Silva and N'Golo Kante, both of whom tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The pair missed the Chesterfield game but could return in time for Chelsea's Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Tottenham on Wednesday if they post negative tests 24 hours before kick-off. Tuchel is hopeful that Silva and Kante can both play a part, as he added when quizzed on their fitness: ""Whether they return depends on how Thiago and N‚ÄôGolo feel in themselves and it also depends on the tests they do and the regulations, if I‚Äôm not wrong. ""So I cannot give any update on those two ahead of Tottenham just yet.

What is Christian Eriksen's net worth? How much will the Manchester United target earn at his next club,"Christian Eriksen has been in contact with Manchester United for a possible transfer in the summer after his short-term contract with Brentford came to an end.  The Danish playmaker, who suffered a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, returned to football with the Bees and made 11 appearances in the Premier League, scoring once and assisting four goals. Since the health scare, the player has been¬†fitted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) - a type of pacemaker. He had to terminate his contract with Inter as regulations in Italy prevents players with an ICD from competing in Serie A. ¬† However, the former Tottenham star can continue his career in the Premier League as the competition does not have the same prohibitions.  How much is Eriksen worth? Has his value plummeted since the incident in Euro 2020? How much will he earn at Manchester United? GOAL takes a look... Eriksen's net worth is estimated to be around $25m. These figures are speculative though, especially as his business interests tend not to be widely publicised. Eriksen was entitled to a salary of around ¬£228,000 when he was with Inter. After the short stint with Brentford, he is close to joining Manchester United where he will be earning just under ¬£300,000 a week, according to Sky Sports reporter¬†Michael Bridge.  Eriksen has an endorsement deal with Nike and also uses his social media handles to promote their products. He had also been linked with State Drink, a Danish energy drink brand.  Eriksen remains pretty active on social media. He likes to post pictures from his matchdays and sometimes when he is spending time with his family. He has 4.3m followers on Instagram, and another 967.2k on Twitter. He is not present on Facebook.

"Chelsea vs Wolves: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Chelsea are in need of a positive result against Wolves on Saturday as they look to hold on to third place in the Premier League. Taking just one point from their last two matches has put the Blues' hold on third in danger as Arsenal have moved to within three points of them with four matches left. But they take on a side on a three-game losing streak as they approach the clash at Stamford Bridge.  Chelsea are big favourites to win the Premier League match at 1/3 (1.33) with bet365. The visitors, who have not won any of their last three matches in the league, are offered at 17/2 (9.5) and the draw at 4/1 (5.0). Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku is priced at 15/4 (4.75) to get the first goal of the game, while team-mate Kai Havertz is priced at 4/1 (5.0) and Mason Mount and Timo Werner are both 9/2 (5.5). Raul Jimenez could be back in the Wolves starting XI this week and is priced at 10/1 (11.0) to be the first scorer and Fabio Silva is 14/1 (15.0). Chelsea were bested by Everton at Goodison Park last time out and drew 1-1 with Manchester United at Old Trafford three days before. Their home form of late has hardly been convincing, either, having suffered defeats against Arsenal, Real Madrid and Brentford over the last month. With one win from their last four matches, they are not in the best shape, but Wolves are on a miserable run themselves, losing four of their last five games. The visitors suffered another injury blow this week when Nelson Semedo was ruled out for the rest of the season. Chelsea have hardly been thrilling of late but are expected to get the three points here. Backing them to win half-time/full-time at 21/20 (2.05) may prove a smart bet.

The never-ending No.9 race: Should the USMNT keep faith in Ferreira?,"In a position as results-based as a striker, do you get points for trying? Do you get credit for coming close, for nearly doing it? Is there value in having someone that simply creates danger? Can movement, playmaking and chances outweigh a lack of goals? Those are the questions that the USMNT may have to ask themselves in a few months, and those are the questions currently being put forth by young Jesus Ferreira. Through the first two games of this four-game window, Ferreira has certainly created chances. You could easily argue that, with Ferreira up top, the USMNT is at its most dangerous. Aganst Morocco and Uruguay, the 21-year-old FC Dallas star has shown the ability to bring his teammates into the game, drive the ball forward and put defenders on their heels. What he hasn't done, at least so far this window, is score goals. He's come close several times, but the ball hasn't found the back of the net for one reason or another, from big saves to missed opportunities. And so here we sit, wondering if the USMNT can thrive with Ferreira as the potential starter when things get going in Qatar. Can the USMNT win with a striker who probably isn't ready to be your primary goalscorer? ""The main focus as a nine is to score goals,"" Ferreira said, ""but a lot of people have to see that the nine can also assist and can build out and get help out the building. ""I think my job is to facilitate other players to be able to score and to help the other players be in a position to score goals also."" He continued: ""As a forward, it's important to score goals to keep your mindset right. I know that right now I'm going through a little struggle, but if I stay focused and I keep working, the goals will come."" Jesus Ferreira taking his chances early üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ pic.twitter.com/bSmfAwT2yH To Ferreira's credit, the finishing struggles we've seen so far can be attributed to a few things: big-game jitters, a step up in competition, and international inexperience. All could be factors. And, on the club level, he's certainly finished his chances, as he leads MLS with nine goals so far this season. Internationally, he has three goals from his first 11 caps, including a vital goal agaisnt Panama in the final World Cup qualifying window ‚Äì a fine haul considering his age a positioning. It's not that Ferreira can't finish, because he absolutely can and has shown he can. He's a good young striker that can definitely find the back of the net. It's just that he hasn't finished in his most recent two games, which just so happen to be two of the last games left before a World Cup. With five months between the U.S. and their flight to Qatar, there isn't that much time to make impressions or add wrinkles to your game. This may very well be the exact version of Ferreira we get in Qatar, but is that version good enough to start? Ferreira, as things stand, is still not quite a pure No.9. He'd primarily been used as a playmaker by FC Dallas before the departure of Ricardo Pepi ‚Äì a player that, ironically, he's now battling with for the USMNT striker spot. Because of that, Ferreira is probably the best striker in the pool when it comes to creating in the attacking third. Jes√πs Ferreira has scored 7Ô∏è‚É£ goals deemed unsaveable by the goalkeeper this season in MLS üéØ@FCDallas | @Jesusfcd27 pic.twitter.com/34CuOHFIWs He clearly understands the needs of Berhalter's system as he frequently finds himself in a position to score. He's not a one-trick pony up top either as he works well with the team's star wingers, which could be invaluable come World Cup time. There's an argument to be made that, even if Ferreira isn't the best goalscorer in the pool, he is the player best equipped to open up space for Christian Pulisic, TIm Weah, Brenden Aaronson and Gio Reyna and, given the talent of those players, might that just be more valuable? Ferreira, by any measure, is very intelligent with his movement despite his young age. He knows when and where to drag defenders and, perhaps most importantly, when to get the hell out of the way and let someone like Pulisic cook. ""The connection, the chemistry, is getting there,"" Ferreira says. ""Every practice, we get better and better. ""I enjoy playing with these guys and I know that every time I can turn, there are runners in behind and even, when I play with Brenden, I know that he can always play those balls in behind. ""There's always an adaptation that I have to have to make as a nine. If I'm playing with Tim, I know that he's always going to be running behind or if I play with Brenden or Christian, I know that they're always going to come inside and play the ball. I have to adapt."" But those chances, the missed chances, are a big strike against Ferreira. In a World Cup setting, goalscorers may only get one or two opportunities to change a game and, ultimately, change a tournament. Those chances may or may not fall to Ferreira but, if they do, will he be ready? Maybe the question is if anyone will be ready. THE FLOODGATES ARE OPEN!@Jesusfcd27 makes it 3-0 for the @USMNT against Panama üî• pic.twitter.com/xDiFZStxv2 Haji Wright has shown promise and has scored plenty in Turkey, but he's still only had a few minutes with the senior team so the jury is still out. Josh Sargent hasn't been scoring for Norwich, Daryl Dike has struggled since his initial breakthrough and players like Matthew Hoppe, Jordan Pefok and Gyasi Zardes are probably too far behind to catch up. Then, there's Pepi, a player that, six months ago, was the heir apparent. Perhaps the Augsburg striker comes out on fire for his club this season, finds his footing and plays his way back into the starting role. Barring that, though, the U.S. are looking at a player once deemed to be the goalscorer of the future that hasn't scored any goals in about nine months. Gregg Berhalter has pointed to France's World Cup triumph last cycle, how they didn't need goals from their No.9 to take down all comers. France is obviously a different animal and Ferreira is no Olivier Giroud, but the point may still stand. The U.S. may very well be better off without a pure No.9. They may be better with Ferreira's ability to help the attack flow and create for himself and others. There are still two games this window for Ferreira and Wright to make their mark, even if goals scored against Grenada and El Salvador probably won't count for quite as much as goals against Morocco or Uruguay. But if Ferreira can find just a few goals to add to his game, if he can convert a few of those chances that he's missed over the last week or so, he may very well seize control of the seemingly never-ending No.9 race.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/never-ending-no-9-race-should-usmnt-keep-faith-ferreira/blt42fc0abcfde74664,Ryan Tolmich,b171814e-fb61-4124-a0b5-a7e50d6692ca
"'Irresponsible, unprofessional and disrespectful' - Liverpool chairman demands apology from French sports minister","Liverpool chairman Tom Werner has demanded an apology from the sports minister of France, Amelie Oudea-Costera, for her ""irresponsible, unprofessional, and wholly disrespectful"" comments on the treatment of fans at the Champions League final. Real Madrid's 1-0 victory over Liverpool at Stade de France was overshadowed by chaotic scenes outside the stadium as thousands of supporters were denied entry despite having valid tickets. Others managed to force their way in without a match pass, while police used tear gas and pepper spray on the fans that were left queuing behind the barriers. UEFA subsequently blamed the use of ""fake tickets"" as the main cause of the dangerous incident, while the French government has suggested Liverpool fans were the guilty party. French sports minister Oudea-Costera said to RTL on Monday: ""What happened, first of all, was this mass gathering of the British supporters of the Liverpool club, without tickets or with fake tickets. ""When there are that many people by the entrance to the stadium, there will be people trying to force their way in through the doors of the Stade de France, and a certain number of youths from the nearby area who were present tried to get in by mixing in with the crowd."" Liverpool chairman Werner has penned a letter in response to Oudea-Costera, in which he reveals he has been contacted by a ""countless"" number of fans who were left fearing for their safety on Saturday night. Werner says the French government is playing a ""blame game"" and has expressed his hope that an ""impartial"" investigation will be completed without interference. ""I am writing to you today out of utter disbelief that a minister of the French government, a position of enormous responsibility and influence, could make a series of unproven pronouncements on a matter of such significance before a proper, formal, independent investigation process has even taken place,"" his letter begins. ""The events that occurred in and around the Stade de France on Saturday night at the UEFA Champions League final were not only incredibly dangerous for all who attended, but raised serious questions about the organisation and operation of the event.  ""This should be the focus of all interested parties today, rather than pursuing a blame game strategy via press conference. I have received countless emails from Liverpool supporters who were frightened to death, and subject to police harassment, pepper spray and tear gas.  ""Moreover, the situation was no better at the end of the evening than at the beginning, with many fans robbed, and attacked by gangs. It was clear that fans were forced to go through a gauntlet, spending more than two hours in queues.  ""One person said they were 'trapped against the gates, nobody was moving, and nobody on the other side of the gates was communicating at all'. These fans were treated like cattle. ""How can loose data and unverified assertions presented this morning be anywhere near factual without a truly independent and transparent investigation with the right stakeholders including our supporters, our club and others taking place.  ""Worse still, these assertions undermine the pursuit of truth and transparency which should underpin the motivations of any organization or individual with a desire to ensure such unacceptable scenes are never repeated."" Werner added: ""The fact that your public position went against this objective is a concern in itself. That you did so without any recourse to ourselves or our supporters is an even greater one. ""All voices should count in this process, and they should count equally and fairly. As a club, it was already our strong feeling that any investigation should be impartial, independent, and transparent.  ""This view has only intensified as a direct result of your public comments and the impact they have had on a narrative which runs contrary to the experiences of many.  ""Your comments were irresponsible, unprofessional, and wholly disrespectful to the thousands of fans harmed physically and emotionally. The UEFA Champions League final should be one of the finest spectacles in world sport, and instead it devolved into one of the worst security collapses in recent memory.  ""On behalf of all the fans who experienced this nightmare I demand an apology from you, and assurance that the authorities and UEFA allow an independent and transparent investigation to proceed.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-chairman-french-sports-minister-champions-league/blt6edea022dd8b9ce0,James Westwood,c28f909a-253a-43fd-b631-2674183233f8
"Maccabi Haifa vs Olympiacos: Predictions, tips & betting odds","Israeli champions Maccabi Haifa welcome their Greek counterparts Olympiacos to the Sammy Ofer stadium on Wednesday evening for the first leg of the Champions League second qualifying round tie. The hosts have only ever made it through the group stages of Europe's premier club competition on two occasions, the most recent of which came in 2009. The Greeks meanwhile have more continental experience and have been in the group stages of the Champions League in eight of the last 11 years. Despite a sell-out crowd of 23,000 in Israel's third-largest city, the hosts remain marginal outsiders, with bet365 offering a victory for Maccabi at 9/5 (2.80). The visitors for their part can be backed at 29/20 (2.45) to record a first-leg victory ahead of next week's decider in Pireaus, while the draw can be backed at 2/1 (3.00). First goal scorer markets are not available for this game. The hosts have already played one competitive game so far, losing on penalties to Hapoel Beer Sheva at the weekend in the Israeil Super Cup. It will have been a useful run out ahead of this vitally important clash, against an Olympiacos side who have contested eight friendly matches in order to prepare for this European showdown. Neither side is likely to be at their best given the early nature of this fixture, and there could be some interest in opposing a high-scoring game. Both teams will surely look to keep things tight and make sure they are still in the tie come next week's second leg, and this should make for a cagey contest with few goals. Under 2.5 goals is priced at 13/20 (1.65) while combining this selection with both teams to score 'no' sees the odds rise to a more appealing 11/10 (2.10). There could also be some interest in opposing goals in the first half with under 0.5 goals in the opening 45 minutes looking like an attractive option at 6/4 (2.50). Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.    Under 2.5 goals and both teams to score 'no' at 11/10 (2.10) for a 1pt stake with bet365 ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maccabi-haifa-vs-olympiacos-predictions-tips-and-betting/bltef4a131a7c563bc4,Phil Kitromilides,9e4717f4-f87a-4b34-834e-90535735d305
Manchester United and Chelsea-linked Nkunku signs new RB Leipzig contract until 2026,"Christopher Nkunku, who has been heavily linked with Manchester United and Chelsea, has signed a new contract at RB Leipzig to 2026. The France international forward hit 35 goals and registered 19 assists in 50 appearances last season to see his stock soar. Clubs across Europe have been linked with the 24-year-old, most notably in the Premier League, but he has committed his immediate future to the Bundesliga heavyweights. Explaining his decision to the club‚Äôs official website, Nkunku said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased to continue wearing the RB Leipzig shirt. ‚ÄúAfter our great achievement in winning the DFB-Pokal, it remained clear that my story here isn‚Äôt over yet ‚Äì we want more! ‚ÄúI was really impressed with the club‚Äôs efforts to keep me, so a big thanks goes to those responsible for the trust in me and especially to [Leipzig CEO] Oliver Mintzlaff, with who I was always in close contact. ‚ÄúRB Leipzig have made a name for themselves on the international stage in recent years and have shown time and again that we can compete for titles.

"France vs Ivory Coast: Predictions, odds & betting tips","France hope to maintain their seven-game unbeaten run when they host Ivory Coast in a friendly on Friday. Ivory Coast, meanwhile, are looking to bounce back from a disappointing display at the Africa Cup of Nations by springing a surprise against Les Bleus. The Elephants have a strong squad at their disposal, too, and could spring a surprise at Stade Velodrome. France are the heavy favourites to win against Ivory Coast at 4/11 (1.36) with bet365 while the visitors are serious underdogs at 15/2 (8.5). A draw between the two teams is available at 15/4 (4.75). Kylian Mbappe has been in great goalscoring form for Les Bleus, having scored seven goals in his last four appearances for the national team. Mbappe can be backed at 3/1 (4.0) to score the first goal of the game, while Antoine Griezmann is available at 15/4 (4.75). Ivory Coast star Nicolas Pepe is priced at 12/1 (13.0) to open the scoring and Sebastien Haller is set at the same price. France are without in-form striker Karim Benzema because of injury, while Benjamin Pavard had to pull out of the squad after testing positive for Covid-19. N'Golo Kante is a doubt for the match against Ivory Coast, as is Lucas Digne. Didier Deschamps' team are on a five-game winning run and unbeaten since they were eliminated from Euro 2020 at the round of 16 stage. Ivory Coast, meanwhile, have seen Hamed Traore and Wilfried Singo withdraw from the squad ahead of this game. The African side underwhelmed at Afcon this year, crashing out at the last-16 stage as eventual runners-up Egypt bested them on penalties. They will be determined to put that disappointment behind them by putting in a strong display against France. As France are the big favourites and in such fine form, it may be worth backing them to win with a -1 handicap at 1/1 (2.0).

Messi returning to Barcelona would delight Jordi Alba as he hopes 'one of the best' Dembele is given new contract,"Jordi Alba enjoyed the most productive of professional relationships with Lionel Messi during an iconic Argentine‚Äôs time at Barcelona, and the Blaugrana left-back is hoping that a seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner can be convinced to retrace his steps back to Camp Nou. An all-time great saw a career-long stint in Catalunya come to a close in the summer of 2021 as financial difficulties for La Liga heavyweights forced him to depart as a free agent and link up with Paris Saint-Germain. Things have not played out as planned in the French capital, as jeers have been aimed in Messi‚Äôs direction, and Alba is among those eager to see questions asked of whether an emotional return to a spiritual home can be put in place. Barca defender Alba, who provided plenty of assists for a record-setting goalscorer prior to an enforced parting of ways, has told El Larguero of mounting speculation surrounding a South American superstar: ‚ÄúIt wasn't easy for him, his team-mates or the club, but football is like that. It's hard to see him with another shirt, but he's still the best in the world. ‚ÄúHe's got a lot of football left and I'm sure next year he'll be much better. ‚ÄúMessi is the player with whom I've understood the best and it would be nice if he came back. I suffered a lot after his departure as he was a good friend.‚Äù While hoping to see Messi return to Camp Nou at some stage, Alba is also looking for Ousmane Dembele to stick around. The World Cup-winning France international forward continues to run his contract down towards free agency, but a welcome return to form has been enjoyed of late and he could still commit to fresh terms. Alba said of the talented 24-year-old: ‚ÄúRenew Dembele? I think they should. In his position he's one of the best in the world by far. ‚ÄúHe's motivated and I don't know what he's going to do, but I hope he stays.‚Äù There has also been plenty of talk at Barcelona regarding possible incomings this summer, with Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland considered to be a top target. Alba is a big fan of the Norwegian, and Real Madrid-linked Kylian Mbappe, but feels both will need to raise their game if they are to make big-money moves to La Liga. The Spain international added when asked to make his pick between two of the most exciting forwards on the planet: ‚ÄúI wouldn't know who to choose. Mbappe is crazy and he showed that in the [Champions League last-16] tie against Madrid. Haaland is also young and scores a lot of goals. ‚ÄúPlaying for Dortmund and PSG is not the same as playing at Camp Nou or the Bernabeu. We would have to see what they do here.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-returning-barcelona-jordi-alba-best-dembele-new/blta462a2d9f0807d7f,Chris Burton,2b7acfc1-fb39-4831-a1d6-1452affc6056
Ex-Werder Bremen coach Anfang apologises and explains reasons behind fake vaccination card,"Former Werder Bremen coach Markus Anfang has apologised and offered an explanation for using a fake Covid-19 vaccination card. Anfang stepped down from his role at Weserstadion when the allegations initially came to light in November, citing a desire to step back from the ""stress"" of the situation as public prosecutors in Germany launched a full investigation. The 47-year-old, who had previously denied the claims, was found guilty of forging vaccine documents two months later and hit with a one-year ban from football. Anfang finally came out to issue an apology for his actions in the ZDF sports studio on Saturday, admitting that he failed in his role as a sports professional and brought a lot of unnecessary pain on those closest to him. ""I have in no way lived up to my role as a role model. I have disappointed many people, lied to them and done a lot of damage to my family,"" he said. ""I can understand that many people are angry and disappointed. I would love to turn back the clock and undo this mistake."" Anfang went on to explain that his decision to avoid getting vaccinated stemmed from a fear of suffering the same health issues as his father Dieter, who had a heart attack when his son was in charge of Koln back in 2019. ""I'm still afraid of the vaccination. He had a very bad heart attack, was more dead than alive, was resuscitated nine times,"" Anfang said of his father's cardiac arrest. ""I experienced it first hand and when you see all this, how your dad fights his way back to life - that just does something to you. This fear that I have as a result is difficult for me to take away."" The German coach added on why he felt the need to lie about being vaccinated: ""In the end, when I'm asked for explanations, they're not excuses for what I did. I used a fake health certificate.  ""I wasn't vaccinated, I lied, I didn't tell the truth because it was for me at that moment it was like I can only stay in the job and do my work with a vaccination. That's when I made this mistake. I'm terribly sorry.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-werder-bremen-coach-anfang-apologises-explains-reasons/blt00f73fe01d7d5341,James Westwood,577ca447-767c-4a2f-b16c-2d246d938ded
"Juventus vs Villarreal: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Juventus welcome Villarreal to the Allianz Stadium on Wednesday evening in the second leg of their last-16 encounter in the Champions League, with the tie finely poised. The first leg ended 1-1 at the Estadio de la Ceramica three weeks ago, and both teams will feel they have a strong chance of progressing to the last eight of the tournament. Juve have won 10 of their last 11 home games in the Champions League and bet365 offer them at 19/20 (1.95) to claim another victory. Villarreal, meanwhile, have played well on the road in this season's competition, recording two wins from three games, and can be backed at 16/5 (4.20), with the draw priced at 12/5 (3.40). Dusan Vlahovic has hit the ground running since joining from Fiorentina in January, with the Serbia international scoring the opening goal in the first leg. Vlahovic is the favourite to break the deadlock at 15/4 (4.75) while Alvaro Morata is priced at 4/1 (5.00) and Villarreal's Dutch forward Arnaut Danjuma can be backed at 6/1 (7.00). Since the first leg, Max Allegri's side have won all four matches they have played and, while Juve are not enjoying their best season, they have been able to find the back of the net regularly. The Turin side have scored in 20 of their last 21 matches in all competitions and they will feel confident of netting once more against a Villarreal team who have kept just one clean sheet in their seven games in the Champions League this term. Indeed, in four of those seven games, Unai Emery's men have conceded at least twice and there should be some interest in backing the hosts to find the back of the net more than once. Juve to score over 1.5 goals is offered at 11/10 (2.10) and, with the Serie A side boasting two excellent, in-form strikers in Dusan Vlahovic and Alvaro Morata, they should be backed to cause Villarreal some problems.

Dybala signs for Roma on free transfer as ex-Juventus star links up with Mourinho,"Paulo Dybala has signed for Roma on a free transfer, with the Argentina forward opting to link up with Jose Mourinho at Stadio Olimpico after months of speculation over his future. Dybala's seven-year career at Juventus ended upon the expiration of his contract in June, but he will now remain in Italy with the Giallorossi.

He is set to earn around ‚Ç¨6 million-per-year (¬£5.1m/$6m) in salary. Dybala will wear No.21 at Roma, the same digit he had at Juventus. He was offered the No.10, but refused it out of respect to club legend Francesco Totti. Fellow new Roma signing Nemanja Matic had taken No.21 for the upcoming season, but will now switch to No.8 instead. A whole host of top clubs were linked with Dybala earlier in the year, including Premier League quartet Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham. Inter, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona,  Milan and Bayern Munich had also been linked with the 28-year-old, but Mourinho managed to convince him that Roma was the best place for him to continue his career. The Giallorossi boss reportedly played a key role in brokering the deal for Dybala, who will be expected to hit the ground running for his new club when they open their 2022-23 campaign against Salernitana on August 14. Dybala has followed Mile Svilar, Nemanja Matic and Zeki Celik as Roma's fourth summer signing, while the likes of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Alessandro Florenzi and Cengiz Under have all left the club. Mourinho has admitted that further investment will be needed for his side to break into the Serie A top four and compete for the Europa League, with Dybala unlikely to be the last man through the Stadio Olimpico doors. It has been reported that the Roma boss is prioritising a new winger, and while Valencia‚Äôs Goncalo Guedes and Sassuolo‚Äòs Domenico Berardi have both been linked, GOAL understands that Mourinho has first instructed club officials to look into a possible deal for Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha.

The Germany international has been a key player under Thomas Tuchel in the 2021-22 campaign, making 42 appearances across all competitions.

Widely regarded as one of the best defenders in the league, Rudiger can also boast having the fastest sprint speed this term with an impressive 36.7 km/h reached against Brighton. Perhaps surprisingly, the 29-year-old beat out pacey forwards Adama Traore, now on loan at Barcelona from Wolves, and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, who both come in at 36.6 km/h.

'I would do it over and over again' - Rangnick has no regrets about taking Man Utd job,"Ralf Rangnick insists he has no regrets about taking the Manchester United job despite their indifferent form under his stewardship. The Red Devils have won just one of their last seven games in all competitions and face a battle to qualify for the Champions League next season. They go into Saturday‚Äôs match against bottom side Norwich in seventh place in the Premier League, six points outside the top four. Rangnick replaced Ole Gunnar Solksjaer on an interim basis in November and is due to hand over to a permanent successor in the summer before taking up a two-year consultancy role, with Ajax boss Erik ten Hag the frontrunner for the job. It was hoped his appointment would boost their chances of making the top four, but the German has failed to get the side firing on a consistant basis, winning just nine of his 22 games in charge. The fanbase has grown increasingly frustrated as the campaign has progressed, leading to a protest against the club's owners outside their training ground on Friday, with more protests planned before the Norwich game. Despite all this turbulence Rangnick insists he does not regret taking the job, though he admits he is not happy with how things have panned out so far. ‚ÄúNo. No regrets whatsoever. I would do it over and over again,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret that at all.

""I think we are all aware it‚Äôs not an easy squad, the whole situation was not easy or I would not be sitting here and Ole would probably still be here. Again, I think we have shown in the past couple of months we were able to raise the level but not in the same sustainable way that I would have wished. That‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm not happy at all with what we‚Äôve done and achieved so far.‚Äù Rangnick thinks some of his players may have struggled to cope with the level of expectation, which has resulted in some stuttering performances. The Red Devils are without a win in three games and slipped to a 1-0 defeat at relegation battlers Everton last weekend. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if this was the case but it might be with one or two or three of our players. It seems to be like that, that the level of expectation is high and some of the players seem to struggle with their own performance with that,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut, again there are no alibis and no excuses we have to be ready to cope and deal with it. ""For tomorrow I‚Äôm sure and fully aware of that and I‚Äôm convinced and very positive that all the players know about this. It's a test of character and mentality. ""Whatever speculation we have as to what I think or you think was the reason behind the performance at Everton we have to be able to in our house [stadium] beat a team like Norwich and show the best possible performance.

Grealish and Foden pictured on night out before Guardiola left them out of Man City victory,"Manchester City duo Jack Grealish and Phil Foden have been pictured on a night out that seemingly led to Pep Guardiola leaving them out of his side at Newcastle United on Sunday.  The England internationals both scored in the 7-0 victory over Leeds United last Tuesday but were dropped from the starting line-up at St James‚Äô Park five days later.  Guardiola made changes after warning his players that those that do not behave in the correct manner will not play, although it is understood that John Stones was on the bench only because of Joao Cancelo‚Äôs return from suspension.  Asked if the changes were because of rotation following the 4-0 victory over Newcastle, Guardiola told BBC 5Live: ‚ÄúNot rotation, no. I decided for this team because they deserved to play today, these guys and not the other ones.  ‚ÄúAt Christmas time I pay a lot of attention to behaviour on and off the pitch. And when off the pitch is not proper they are not going to play.  ‚ÄúSo we have to be focussed all the time because of distractions at Christmas time and everything that happens - you have to still be focused.‚Äù  Neither Grealish nor Foden came off the bench in the win over Newcastle, with Guardiola using Stones, Fernandinho and Cole Palmer instead.  City have asked their players and staff to be vigilant against the fresh wave of Covid-19 that has hit the United Kingdom, with the Premier League already impacted as six matches were postponed at the weekend.  The Premier League champions have so far escaped having to rearrange any fixtures, although Guardiola had to cancel his pre-match press conference after a lateral flow test provided an inconclusive result - testing negative later that day.  The Premier League insists that it has no plans to interrupt the planned fixture schedule in spite of the new outbreak this winter. Both Grealish and Foden were back in training on Monday and will be hoping to reclaim their places for a busy festive schedule with games against Leicester City, Brentford and Arsenal in the space of seven days immediately after Christmas Day.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/grealish-foden-pictured-night-out-guardiola-left-them-out/bltbddcafbc4e2ad7d1,Jonathan Smith,2911d3ae-2ff9-4645-ab60-7c914bad102d
'Messi is a winner' - Aguero expects improvement from PSG star and talks up Man City‚Äôs 'great signing' of Haaland,"Lionel Messi remains ‚Äúa winner‚Äù and his second season at Paris Saint-Germain will be ‚Äúeven better‚Äù says Sergio Aguero, with the Argentine icon backed to overcome a testing debut campaign at Parc des Princes. The seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner scored just 11 goals for PSG in 2021-22, with the heights previously hit by an all-time great proving difficult to scale in France. Fellow Argentine attacker Aguero remains convinced he will sparkle in the French capital at some stage. Aguero, who had been hoping to link up with Messi at Barcelona in the summer of 2021 before seeing a modern day great depart and a heart problem force him into retirement, has said in his role as Stake.com global ambassador: ‚ÄúIt's still his first year and, having to adapt to a different league, his performance has been very good. ‚ÄúLeaving the Champions League aside, they won the league comfortably. PSG is full of elite players and Leo is a winner. I'm sure his second season will be even better.‚Äù When you realise Manchester City still have Erling Haaland to come üò± pic.twitter.com/AVkiUUNaNs While looking forward to seeing more from Messi at PSG, Aguero is also excited by the transfer business being carried out at Manchester City. The Blues' all-time leading goalscorer has seen Pep Guardiola move to fill the void he created when leaving as a free agent last summer by luring Erling Haaland away from Borussia Dortmund in a ¬£51 million ($64m) deal. The prolific Norwegian will be joining a squad that secured another Premier League crown in 2021-22, with Aguero expecting the 21-year-old's presence to carry an ambitious outfit closer to a long-awaited European crown. He said of Haaland‚Äôs arrival at Etihad Stadium: ‚ÄúI think it's a great signing. He can contribute towards scoring and that's big. I hope he racks up a ton of goals. ‚ÄúAdapting to the Premier League will take some time for him, but I'm confident he'll be able to do so well. ‚ÄúRegarding the Champions League - now that's a huge task, but football is about the team, not the players by themselves. If the whole team works like it has been, the trophy will be more reachable. ‚ÄúI think City has grown in experience over the past few years and it's something that can be achieved sooner than later.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-aguero-psg-man-city-signing-haaland/blt3c7e41d817f5dbc2,Chris Burton,b94ed0b5-fa99-4d16-ab2b-55813c3db395
'There are no exceptions!' - Arsenal loanee Pepe criticised for lack of 'intensity' by Nice boss Favre after Marseille drubbing,"WHAT HAPPENED? The Arsenal loanee had a debut to forget as Nice suffered a 3-0 loss to Marseille, with Alexis Sanchez scoring a brace for the visitors. Another Gunners loan star, Nuno Tavares, netted Marseille's third goal.  WHAT THEY SAID: Favre did not mince his words when asked to assess Pepe's performance as he told reporters: ""He hasn‚Äôt played for a long time in England. He has done the pre-season with Arsenal but he hasn‚Äôt played any matches. He is lacking a bit of rhythm, intensity in his placements, his pressing and in his ball recovery, because everyone has to do that.  ""There aren‚Äôt any exceptions. If one or two players don‚Äôt do the work, the whole team is in trouble. Everyone has to do it at the same time, everyone has to defend to recover the ball.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Pepe, Arsenal's record signing who cost them ¬£72m ($85m) when they bought him from Lille three years ago, returned to Ligue 1 earlier this month when signing a season-long loan deal with Nice. He will now hope to rediscover the form that saw him emerge as one of Europe's top prospects at Stade Pierre-Mauroy. IN THREE PHOTOS:    WHAT NEXT FOR PEPE?

Gomez explains why he ignored Real Madrid transfer rumours to sign five-year contract at Liverpool,"Joe Gomez found himself at the centre of surprising rumours linking him with Real Madrid heading into the summer transfer window - with Aston Villa said to be another of his suitors - but the 25-year-old defender has opted to sign a new five-year contract at Liverpool. He insists it was an easy choice, with little attention paid to the speculation suggesting that he could head to Spain. He does face fierce competition for places at Anfield from Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Ibrahima Konate, but a man with 11 England caps never gave any serious thought to leaving Merseyside for Madrid or the West Midlands. Gomez told the Liverpool Echo: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt dispute I heard about these rumours, but until things are concrete with my representatives, I take it all with a pinch of salt. ‚ÄúAny interest is flattering, but I don‚Äôt really see it like as that much of a distraction because until I make my decision, the external noise is just that ‚Äì external. ‚ÄúOnce I got my head around what I wanted to do, my signing is me understanding the challenge and wanting to rise to it.‚Äù Gomez found game time hard to come by last season, with a man that has previously worked his way back from cruciate ligament damage and a broken leg putting himself back in contention for minutes after eight months on the sidelines with a patella tendon issue. He was handed just four Premier League starts in 2021-22, and 21 appearances in total, but believes a regular role can be secured in Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs plans. Gomez said: ‚ÄúI can understand why people would have thought I‚Äôd be considering moving on, for sure, 100%. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs apparent from my age now and based on my opportunities in the past, there was definitely still a decision for me to make. ‚ÄúI guess you could see it at as a crossroads, but speaking to the club, I knew it was an important decision for me to make. ‚ÄúFundamentally, the opportunity that I have here and the platform and the chance to be at this club is one that is hard to walk away from.

'Wrexham is the greatest drug on earth!' - Ryan Reynolds revels in sensational 6-5 comeback against Dover Athletic,"Ryan Reynolds described Wrexham as ""the greatest drug on earth"" while revelling in their sensational 6-5 comeback victory over Dover Athletic. Wrexham moved up to second in the National League after a thrilling win against bottom-of-the-table Dover at the Racecourse Ground on Saturday, battling back from 5-2 down to steal the points in the dying seconds of stoppage time. Hollywood A-lister Reynolds, who co-owns the club alongside fellow actor Rob McElhenney, took to social media to express his joy after the final whistle as he also joked about the toll the drama of the occasion had taken on him. ""I just lost nine years off my life. And I‚Äôm okay with that,"" Reynolds wrote on Twitter. ""Apologies to my family. Also, bury me in Wales."" I just lost 9 years off my life. And I‚Äôm okay with that. Apologies to my family.

I love every second of hating it. @Wrexham_AFC is the greatest drug on earth. ""I love every second of hating it. @Wrexham_AFC is the greatest drug on earth,"" he replied. McElhenney used the platform to air his thoughts on the game too, saying: ""I love this game. I hate this game. I love this game. UP THE TOWN."" I love this game. I hate this game. I love this game. UP THE TOWN. https://t.co/pPDpgOrkZs Reynolds and McElhenney completed the purchase of Wrexham at the start of 2021, reportedly injecting ¬£2 million pounds into the club. The pair have since been doing their best to contribute to the Welsh outfit's pursuit of a return to the Football League, and have been regularly pictured attending matches at the Racecourse Ground. Reynolds opened up on the venture during an appearance on ITV earlier this month, telling television presenter Lorraine Kelly: ""Both me and Rob McElhenney, we love it. It‚Äôs such a passion project.¬† ""Football in general has really been both the best and the worst thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.

‚ÄòThey lie more than Putin!‚Äô - La Liga chief Tebas takes aim at Agnelli amid reports of resurrection of Super League plans ,"La Liga president Javier Tebas has claimed that those clubs at the centre of renewed talk regarding a European Super League ‚Äúlie more than Putin‚Äù, with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin also taking aim at Juventus, Real Madrid and Barcelona amid further reports of a breakaway competition being established. A dozen prominent clubs from across Europe ‚Äì including Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, AC Milan, Inter and Atletico Madrid ‚Äì were part of an original scheme that was quickly shut down after it generated fierce opposition from supporters. Three clubs have refused to shelve the proposals, though, with Juve chairman Andrea Agnelli still looking to garner support for an event that would sit alongside the more established Champions League. The plans have not gone down well with those calling the shots in Spanish football, with Tebas saying at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London: ‚ÄúHe [Agnelli] will have to explain it, if he doesn‚Äôt explain it, he will be lying. ‚ÄúA week ago, I think it was in his house there was a meeting of the three teams. Now they are saying they don‚Äôt want fixed slots, Real Madrid are saying they don‚Äôt want the first slot. It is false. ‚ÄúIt is very difficult for the English teams to form part of this competition so they are creating a European league with two categories and the national leagues are the second categories. ‚ÄúThere will be two or three people relegated but there will always be the typical teams - Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid. It will be difficult for them to go down. ‚ÄúThey have made enemies of UEFA and the Premier League, whose growth goes against their model. We know this, we have got this information. They can say what they want but this is what they are working on. ‚ÄúEvery time I read about it, I get cross, I think they lie more than Putin to be honest. ‚ÄúThey are insisting that introducing this will not affect national leagues. We must be idiots, we must be dumb. But we all say it hurts the national leagues. ‚ÄúFor me it is an insult, I feel humiliated. They will do huge harm.‚Äù A mural of Super League founder and Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli on the streets of Rome üì∏ pic.twitter.com/ABo1eo7Sk1 UEFA president Ceferin is another of those that has grown tired of the incessant Super League talk and has sought to reiterate once and for all that any club that agrees to become involved in the project will be removed from all other European competitions. He said: ‚ÄúI have to say that those speaking about the Super League are not speaking about football. I am sick and tired of this non-football project. ‚ÄúFirst, they launched their nonsense of the idea in the middle of a pandemic. Now, we read articles that they are planning to launch another idea now in the middle of a war. ‚ÄúDo I have to speak more about these people? They obviously live in a parallel world. ‚ÄúWe are helping in a terrible situation, they are working on a project like that. They can pay whoever they want to write ‚Äòthis is a nice project, they are full of solidarity, there will be charity to small ones‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis is nonsense and everyone knows it. One of them, after it, called me and apologised - but then they go again. For them, the fans are customers. For us, the fans are fans.‚Äù Speaking directly about Juve chief Agnelli, Ceferin added: ‚ÄúThey criticised UEFA and the ECA, one of them was chairman of the ECA. ‚ÄúI have quotes from where he was praising the system a week before they launched the Super League. ‚ÄúThey can play their own competition, nobody forbids them. But if they play their own competition, they can‚Äôt play in our competition.‚Äù Agnelli also spoke at the Financial Times press conference, and has confirmed that he is still fully behind the Super League while dismissing Tebas' criticism. ""In my opinion European football is in desperate need of reform,"" said the Juve chief. ""I will not accept questions about Tebas, his statements speak for themselves.¬†The Super League has not gone bankrupt."" Agnelli added on the current state of the controversial plans: ""UEFA knew that I as Juventus president was working on something different.¬†It is a collective work of 12 teams, not just one person.¬† ""These 12 clubs have signed a 120-page contract and it is still binding for 11 of them.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lie-more-than-putin-la-liga-tebas-agnelli-reports/blt00d723974b2f2c20,Chris Burton,b8a8dd7e-6ff7-4da8-a203-452504209b95
Arsenal loanee Saliba uncertain on future after winning Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year,"Arsenal loanee William Saliba admitted to being uncertain about his future after winning the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award for 2021-22. Saliba moved to Marseille on a season-long loan last summer after a frustrating start to his Arsenal career, with Mikel Arteta yet to hand him his competitive debut at Emirates Stadium. The 21-year-old has proven his quality with Marseille this term, featuring in 36 Ligue 1 games to help the club fight for Champions League qualification, but he is not sure where he will be playing his football in 2022-23. Saliba beat Nice‚Äôs Khephren Thuram, Lens star Arnaud Kalimuendo, Paris Saint-Germain‚Äôs Nuno Mendes and Lyon‚Äôs Castello Lukeba to the UNFP Trophy at the weekend, which is awarded to the best young player in the French top flight. The defender picked up the award after Marseille's 2-0 defeat to Rennes on Saturday, which he admits could be his last appearance for Jorge Sampaoli's side. ""It's an honour, a source of pride. I dedicate this trophy to my team-mates, my club and the supporters,"" Saliba said at the awards ceremony in Paris. ""Did I play my last match with OM? I don't know. The future will tell us. ""The most important thing is to confirm this good season by qualifying for the Champions League. Afterwards, we'll see."" Saliba is due back at Arsenal after Marseille's last game of the season against Strasbourg, and still has two years remaining on his contract in north London. Arteta indicated that the France international still has a future with the Gunners back in October, albeit while admitting that his inclusion will depend on the performance of the other defenders in his squad. ""That is a decision we will make in the summer. Obviously he is our player and naturally that will happen. We will have to sit down and decide what the next step is next,"" the Arsenal boss said. ""I think there is room [to accommodate him,¬†Ben White and Gabriel].

That is because a team-mate who has worked with him at Manchester City and Emirates Stadium says there are ‚Äúsome things‚Äù that he can improve. That should be a scary thought for domestic and European rivals, with Jesus building on his impressive pre-season form to bag a brace for the Gunners in a 4-2 victory over Leicester that has maintained a perfect start to the 2022-23 campaign. After seeing Jesus open his competitive goal account for the Gunners, Zinchenko ‚Äì who won Premier League titles alongside the South American at City ‚Äì told reporters: ‚ÄúOf course I wish him well. And I never had any doubts about him, because he‚Äôs a world-class player in terms of his numbers. ‚ÄúYou can see it as well in how he works along with his attitude every day in training. He‚Äôs an example [to others]. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still young, everyone needs to improve some things. He needs to work on a couple of things, like everyone, but the rest is unbelievable. ‚ÄúHe was good during all the years I‚Äôve spent with him.

The versatile Ukrainian said of the squad pieced together by Mikel Arteta: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the beginning of the season and I think we need to analyse. Still we conceded two goals and from a defensive line that is a lot. That is why we need to keep going - but I‚Äôm so happy for the team and the club. ‚ÄúWe have an unbelievable squad.

'We had to do this' - Ten Hag reveals how Manchester United transfer plans changed,"WHAT HAPPENED? Ten Hag admitted ""adaptations"" had to be made to United's budget in the face of Ajax's insistence on driving up the prices of ¬£81m Antony and ¬£47.5m Lisandro Martinez. The club also paid ¬£60m for Casemiro, while Tyrell Malacia cost ¬£13m. There are add-ons attached to all four signings, which would take the over all spend to around ¬£227m, while Martin Dubravka is set to cost a further ¬£5m on loan. WHAT THEY SAID: ""There was always money,"" said Ten Hag. ""They made adaptations because of how the market was and I think the club did that well. You never know how things go, if you are earlier or later. It‚Äôs a process. First, we really quickly identified the positions we wanted and then identified the players we wanted."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: United's transfer plans have fluctuated wildly this summer. Frenkie de Jong was the priority target - but focus then quickly shifted to Casemiro. In the face of growing supporter unrest after back-to-back defeats at the start of the season - and pressure on the Glazer family to sell - it is notable that moves for budget options, Marko Arnautovic and Adrien Rabiot were scrapped, with Antony and Casemiro costing a combined ¬£141m. IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT NEXT FOR UNITED? The ownership remains a critical question and supporter groups plan to continue protests even after such a huge outlay, with some fans suspicious of the Glazers' motives. Meanwhile, there will be added pressure on Ten Hag to deliver after being handed a club record figure to kick off his revolution. He said: ""If you want to compete at the top, you don‚Äôt have a choice. All the clubs spent this kind of money. If you want to fight for the top four positions you have to do it. We have the ambition, especially in the long term, to play for trophies.

Retrial announced for Wolves fan accused of making racist monkey gesture at Rio Ferdinand,"The Wolves fan accused of causing racially aggravated harassment, alarm or distress towards Rio Ferdinand will face a retrial after a Wolverhampton Crown Court judge discharged the jury on Tuesday.

Chelsea beat Man City to sign ¬£62m Cucurella from Brighton - and take a jab at Seagulls in their announcement,"Chelsea have completed the signing of Marc Cucurella from Brighton as Thomas Tuchel's spending spree continues this summer. The Spanish defender was a much sought-after player in the summer transfer window as Manchester City and Barcelona were also interested in landing him.  After joining Brighton in the summer of 2021 from Spanish side Getafe for a reported fee of ¬£15.4 million, he is again on the move. He had a fantastic season with the Seagulls which saw him win the Players' Player of the Season and being voted Player of the Season.  Chelsea will pay Brighton¬†¬£55 million (‚Ç¨65m/$67m) plus a potential ¬£7m in add-ons to sign Cucurella from Brighton.  The arrival of the defender has been a source of some controversy, after Brighton denied earlier this week that a deal had been done. They wrote on Twitter: ""CLUB STATEMENT: MARC CUCURELLA. Contrary to inaccurate reports from numerous media outlets this evening, no agreement has been reached with any club to sell Marc Cucurella."" How that the transfer has gone through however, Chelsea turned this on its head with a tweet of their own taking aim at the Seagulls with tongue in cheek. CLUB STATEMENT: MARC CUCURELLA. Following reports from numerous media outlets this week, we can confirm an agreement has been reached with Brighton and Hove Albion for the signing of Marc Cucurella. Cucurella was wanted by Manchester City earlier in the summer but the club did not agree with the ¬£50m valuation of the player. They submitted an initial bid of ¬£30m which got rejected and then put in an improved offer of ¬£40m which was also rebuffed by the Seagulls.  Barcelona were also one of the suitors of the defender and he was open to a move to the La Liga outfit as he hails from Catalonia. However, the deal could not go through as Brighton stuck to their price tag. Chelsea were given a window to initiate talks and the Blues agreed to pay the amount. During the negotiations, Brighton were also pushing to sign youngster Levi Colwill - and that deal has also now been completed, the versatile defender arriving on a season-long loan.

'I'm not a dictator' - Arteta calls for 'respect and commitment' from Arsenal squad amid Aubameyang fallout,"Mikel Arteta insists he does not run Arsenal like a dictator, but simply asks for ‚Äúrespect and commitment‚Äù from his players after dropping Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from the squad. Aubameyang was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy this month and has not featured in the team‚Äôs last four matches because of a disciplinary issue. Gunners manager Arteta says he expects the same level of commitment from all of his players, insisting he is not being too harsh on the striker. ‚ÄúI do not establish my authority by being dictatorial or ruthless,‚Äù Arteta told reporters. ‚ÄúI just ask for one thing: respect and commitment. At this level, if I don‚Äôt get that, I will pack my bags and go somewhere else because that is the minimum I can ask for. ‚ÄúI am going to expect that from everybody who works for the club. First of all from myself, and the day I don‚Äôt do that I will walk through that door and go and do something else.

'He has done fantastic work at Ajax' - Man Utd star Ronaldo weighs in on Ten Hag arrival,"Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has backed Erik ten Hag to impress once he takes up the reins at Old Trafford.  Ten Hag has already been appointed United's next permanent manager, a role he will assume once finishing the current season with Ajax.  His exploits with the Dutch giants have won him many admirers, including the legendary Portugal striker.  ""What I know about him is he did a fantastic job for Ajax, that he's an experienced coach, but we need to give him time,"" Ronaldo explained to United's official website.  ""Things need to change the way he wants. ""I hope we have success, of course, because, if you have success, all of Manchester is going to have success as well. I wish him the best. ""We are happy and excited, not only as players, but the supporters as well. ""I wish him the best and let's believe that, next year, we are going to win trophies."" Ten Hag takes over at a club desperate for silverware, especially the Premier League crown.  United last won the title in Sir Alex Ferguson's last season in charge back in 2012-13 and cannot finish higher than sixth this term, leaving them outside the Champions League.  Ajax, meanwhile, lifted their third Eredivisie title in four seasons under Ten Hag in 2021-22 and also reached the Champions League last 16, where they narrowly missed out to Benfica.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/he-has-done-fantastic-work-at-ajax-man-utd-star-ronaldo/blt7e692679469806bd,Daniel Edwards,d465ccda-89f9-42ed-b33a-3842781e3946
FIFA 23: Will EA Sports release a new football game in 2022?,"Since 1993, EA Sports has been publishing FIFA-branded games, with the annual release of a new numbered entry becoming a near three-decade tradition. For the most part, FIFA has dominated its particular field, with their closest competitors, Konami‚Äôs eFootball (Formally known as Pro Evolution Soccer or PES), undergoing a branding and strategy shift in an attempt to compete with EA Sports' game once more. However, the future of the game remains uncertain as FIFA and EA Sports' partnership renewal appears to be doubtful, leaving fans unsure about the release of their new football video game. EA Sports has not yet revealed anything about their next football game, so it remains unclear whether there will be a FIFA 23 or not. However, it seems likely that the game will continue in one form or another.  Should FIFA 23 be released in 2022, it is expected to launch around the end of September, based on the release timetable of the previous year's game. While EA Sports and FIFA must come to an agreement which would see their partnership continue, their current deal doesn‚Äôt end until after the 2022 World Cup in December 2022. That timeline presents a dilemma for EA Sports.  While nothing has been confirmed, it appears increasingly likely that fans will still be able to play a new EA Sports football video game, which according to Xfire will include both a men's and women's World Cup as well as crossplay - a first for EA Sports' football game franchise. EA Sports FC has been widely reported as a potential new name for EA Sports' football game franchise. Trademarks for 'EA Sports FC' have been filed in the UK and EU, fuelling rumours that the famous FIFA video game series could be set for a name change. However, an official name change has not yet been confirmed.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fifa-23-will-ea-sports-release-new-football-game-2022/bltd290751e263e0de2,Nick Khairi,9159e9d4-a998-4009-9a0b-5c4f36d44e58
Espanyol respond to Arsenal's De Tomas transfer interest amid ‚Ç¨75m striker links on deadline day,"Arsenal have asked about the possible availability of Raul de Tomas on transfer deadline day, but have been informed by Espanyol that the Spain international striker is not for sale. The Gunners are leaving it late in the winter window to try and get more firepower into their ranks, with Mikel Arteta needing to counter the possible departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabon international has been frozen out at Emirates Stadium since December, but cover for him will still be required if a loan agreement with Barcelona is pushed through. Several targets have been mooted for Arsenal as they look to cover the loss of Aubameyang, who is in Spain to put the finishing touches to a Camp Nou switch. Ex-Real Madrid forward De Tomas has emerged as a top target, with the 27-year-old hitting 23 goals last season and 11 in the current campaign, but Espanyol chairman Jose Maria Duran told Sport3 of being contacted by the Gunners: ‚ÄúYes, it was a one-time call, but we hardly wanted to listen. ‚ÄúOur position is clear. We will not let Raul de Tomas go, especially not in the middle of the season.‚Äù There were suggestions that Espanyol‚Äôs resolve to retain the services of a prized asset could be tested if a supposed release clause in his contract were to be triggered. Various reports have speculated on the proven frontman being available to any suitor willing to pay ‚Ç¨70 million (¬£58m/$78m), with De Tomas tied to a contract in Catalunya through to 2026. Duran has admitted to the existence of a clause, but claims it is higher than originally stated in the striker‚Äôs terms and is not a price that Espanyol are willing to do business at. He added: ‚ÄúRaul no longer has a clause of 70 million, but due to inflation it is almost 75. Prices go up, but so do our defences.‚Äù Arsenal will now need to turn their attention elsewhere, with De Tomas another option set to fall out of their reach. They had been keen on prolific Serbian forward Dusan Vlahovic prior to seeing him complete a ‚Ç¨75m (¬£62m/$84m) move from Fiorentina to Juventus. Alexander Isak of Real Sociedad and Lille star Jonathan David have also been linked with the Gunners but no deals have been put in place. That is likely to mean that Eddie Nketiah will see out the winter window in north London, with the England U21 international set to be retained by Arsenal despite attracting plenty of interest as his contract runs down.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/espanyol-arsenal-de-tomas-transfer-interest-eur75m-striker-links-/blta65e0121ff671c5c,Chris Burton,7d10add1-2540-42da-9a6d-d5edb64dbc44
Martinelli and Saka shine as Arteta's Arsenal put Aubameyang affair behind them to go fourth,"What a difference a year makes. When Arsenal lost at Everton almost 12 months ago they slumped to 15th in the Premier League and were just four points off the relegation zone. It was the nightmare before Christmas for Mikel Arteta, but things are looking very different this time around with the Gunners up to fourth after Wednesday night‚Äôs 2-0 win against West Ham. All eyes were on Arteta‚Äôs side when they lined up against Hammers, with many predicting they could implode following the controversy surrounding Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. But they did the exact opposite, turning in what was arguably their most complete performance of the season as they did what was needed to climb above David Moyes‚Äô side and into the Champions League places. ‚ÄúI was really pleased,‚Äù said Arteta. ""With the attitude, commitment and quality we showed. ‚ÄúThere are really positive signs with the way the team has played. We‚Äôve made some progress, but there is still a lot to do and we have to be aware of that. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had some bumps in the road, but we‚Äôve learned a lot from them and we have stuck together, from the top of the club to every member of the team and staff. ""The biggest compliment I feel and the players feel the same way, is the way we have our crowd behind us and it‚Äôs been a while. To see that chemistry between team and crowd is unique and I‚Äôm so proud of that.‚Äù Given everything that had gone on in the past week, the response of the Arsenal players was seriously impressive.¬† Trust the process. pic.twitter.com/uNGgVkIzHp They could have gone into their shell after the defeats at Manchester United and Everton, but instead they dusted themselves down and picked up maximum points from Southampton and West Ham. And they did so whilst playing under the backdrop of the Aubameyang situation. It would have been easy to let the fallout from the decision to strip the striker of the captaincy have an impact on the pitch but, if anything, it inspired them to two of their best performances of the season. Questions were rightly asked after the defeats at Old Trafford and Goodison Park about their top-four credentials and whilst they haven‚Äôt answered them all in the last week, they have at the very least shown they are up for the fight. Many wondered whether Arteta‚Äôs tough stance on Aubameyang following his latest disciplinary breach could lead to a split in the Arsenal camp. But there was no sign of that as they largely dominated West Ham. Lacazette was given the armband, as he was against Southampton, and produced a tireless performance as the central striker, while Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka were electric either side of him. Both youngsters were exceptional and it was no surprise they were heavily involved in the goals. Martinelli scored the first, finishing superbly from Lacazette‚Äôs pass, while Saka set up Emile Smith Rowe for the second following a fabulous late breakaway. 22 ‚Äì No team have won more points (22) or recorded more victories (7) in home games than Arsenal in the Premier League this season, while only Manchester City (19.7) and Liverpool (19.4) are averaging more shots per home game than the Gunners (17.9). Fortress. pic.twitter.com/E3G1bFxPML It was a performance full of intensity and energy from Arsenal and one that should kill any talk of a potential dressing room split. Aubameyang might be well liked by the squad, but Arteta clearly still has the full backing of his players on this evidence. ""The players play for the club,‚Äù the Spaniard said. ‚ÄúThey played with the fight and the energy that we expect from them. They were really good, all of them. ‚ÄúThe senior players led by example and I‚Äôm really pleased. They seem to really enjoy helping the [young] boys in a context that has been difficult.‚Äù Arsenal will now head to Leeds on Saturday sitting inside the Champions League places. Whether they can stay there will largely depend on how they get on at places like Elland Road between now and the end of the season. Arteta‚Äôs side have been excellent at home since the start of the campaign, having amassed 22 points from their nine Premier League games at the Emirates. No team has picked up more. It‚Äôs been a different story on their travels, however, with five of their six league defeats so far coming outside of north London. That is something that has to change if they are going to secure a seat at Europe's top table for next season. For now, though, Arsenal are sitting pretty in fourth place in the Premier League.

Delort at the double as Nice overpower Bouanga‚Äôs Saint-Etienne,"OGC Nice subdued Saint-Etienne 4-2 in Wednesday‚Äôs Ligue 1 fixture, with Andy Delort bagging a brace. The Eaglets came into the six-goal thriller on the back of their French Cup defeat by Moses Simon‚Äôs FC Nantes. However, they shook off that setback with a convincing victory over the Stephanois inside Allianz Riviera. Perhaps fuelled by their back-to-back defeats in the French elite division, the visitors took the lead in the 11th minute after Denis Bouanga turned Yvann Macon‚Äôs cross past goalkeeper Walter Benitez. While the hosts were aiming to restore parity, it was Saint-Etienne who doubled his team‚Äôs advantage through Zaydou Youssouf. The former France youth international of Comorian origin was set up by Ryad Boudebouz in the closing stages of the first half. Prior to that effort, Delort's headed goal was chalked off for offside. Despite looking dead and buried, Nice mustered some courage to overturn the deficit before sealing all of the points at stake. First, Melvin Bard reduced the scoreline from a tight angle after he was teed up by Amine Gouiri. At the hour mark, Delort levelled matters after swerving home a beautiful free-kick that sailed past goalkeeper Paul Bernardoni. Two minutes later, the African completed his brace from a Justin Kluivert cut-back, and with Saint-Etienne staring into the abyss, Hicham Boudaoui‚Äôs deflected volley looped into the net to complete a second-half rout. Delort ‚Äì who now boasts 13 Ligue 1 goals in the 2021-22 season ‚Äì was on parade from start to finish, whereas, Gabon international Mario Lemina was subbed off for Morgan Schneiderlin in the 78th minute. Boudaoui was introduced for Bilal Brahimi in the 79th minute, as his compatriot Youcef Atal was not dressed for action. On the opposing side, Gabon‚Äôs Bouanga, Harold Moukoudi (Cameroon), Saidou Sow (Senegal), Boudebouz (Algeria), and Sada Thioub (Senegal) ‚Äì who were all in action could not prevent Saint-Etienne from losing their 19th match so far. While the result catapults Nice into the Uefa Europa League spots with two matches left, the Greens remain three points from safety, having won one of their past nine games.

Chelsea face potential Covid-19 crisis as three first-team stars test positive ahead of Everton clash ,"Chelsea have become the latest Premier League side to be stung by positive Covid-19 tests, with GOAL learning that three more senior stars at Stamford Bridge have contracted coronavirus. At present, the Blues‚Äô clash with Everton on Thursday is still set to go ahead, but that situation could change following the recent postponement of fixtures involving Tottenham and Manchester United. Having to rearrange matches is the last thing that Chelsea need at this stage, with the games coming thick and fast for Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs side across multiple competitions. The Blues have already seen Mateo Kovacic ruled out of their plans of late on the back of a positive Covid-19 test from the Croatia international midfielder. Three more prominent players in west London have now been forced into self-isolation, leaving Tuchel short on options. All of those set to sit out upcoming outings have been in contact with the rest of the Chelsea squad, with a full training session completed on Wednesday. Tuchel was ready to include two of those players in his thoughts for a home date with Everton, but has seen his pre-match planning thrown into disarray. Kovacic was already set to sit out a meeting with the Toffees, alongside Ben Chilwell, who remains sidelined for a while with a knee injury. N‚ÄôGolo Kante is being eased back into the Blues fold, but the World Cup-winning midfielder is not yet ready to start and will only be fit enough to make the bench against Everton. Tuchel is going to have to get creative in his selection, with there few opportunities for him to rest and rotate at present. Chelsea are due to be back in Premier League action on Sunday against Wolves, before then taking on Brentford in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals prior to Christmas. Boxing Day will be spent at Aston Villa, while Brighton are due at Stamford Bridge on December 29 and Liverpool on January 2. Chelsea will then open their FA Cup campaign for 2021-22, while the current holders of the Champions League crown have also had to slot the Club World Cup into their schedule for February.

'I can't wait!' - Sule explains leaving Bayern Munich for transfer to rival Borussia Dortmund,"Niklas Sule says he cannot wait to get started with Borussia Dortmund following his much-publicised transfer from Bayern Munich, as he looks to make a successful leap between Bundesliga rivals. The centre-back has departed the Bavarian outfit following another championship medal, and will now look to find similar success with the Black and Yellow. His move caused shockwaves when it was confirmed earlier this campaign, but now that he is getting ready to open the page of a new chapter, the defender says that the move felt like the right call for him at the current stage of his career. ""When I talked to the club, I felt a real connection to this club's ambitions, with what I've experienced in my career so far, and with what I still want to achieve,"" Sule told the club's website. ""The chance to achieve those goals with BVB was an incredibly exciting prospect, and I can't wait for next season. ""I want to play an important part in us having a good season next year, and I want us to be as successful as possible. In the end we'll see where it takes us, but I'm confident that I can play my part and help us achieve our goals."" The Germany international is not the first player to switch rivals in the Bundesliga, but he knows he will have a fight convincing the famed Yellow Wall in Dortmund - though he is already assured in how he will approach it. ""I think the main way [to win Dortmund fans' hearts] is by playing well,"" he added. ""People will see that I'm getting stuck in for the club colours, and that's definitely my goal. I've played here as an opponent and I always looked forward to those games, because I think the way the Yellow Wall gets behind the team is unique in Germany. ""If we play good, honest football that inspires the fans every weekend, then we'll have a bit of an edge going into every game. That was my experience of Dortmund as an opposing player, and hopefully that's how it will be next year as a player for this club."" Sule was blasted by Bayern on his way out after a contract dispute soured relations, with club president Uli Hoeness telling reporters: ""We always talk about appreciation. Niklas Sule certainly didn't show that to the club."" Similar comments have been made by the club towards Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry who are angling for moves of their own away from the Bavarians. But Gnabry has said respect should cut both ways. ‚ÄúIt's not that each of us (Lewandowski and I) only thinks about money,‚Äù Gnabry said. ‚ÄúThere are other things that play a big role in making you feel good. ‚ÄúAppreciation should come from both sides - from club to player and from player to club.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sule-explains-bayern-munich-exit-borussia-dortmund-transfer/blt803f2f4ee60c87b2,Andrew Steel,edbd8acc-5fad-4c84-85ef-3ca794466c2d
Lingard confirms free transfer to Nottingham Forest after Man Utd exit,"Jesse Lingard has agreed to join Nottingham Forest on a free transfer. The England international left Manchester United this summer after his contract expired. He shared a video on social media confirming his switch to Forest. The 29-year-old was linked with a move back to West Ham, where he thrived on loan during the second half of the 2020-21 season, as well as MLS. But he has opted to join the newly-promoted Forest instead as he looks to capitalise on increased playing time. The club confirmed the arrival of the attacking midfielder on their official website, saying: ""Nottingham Forest are delighted to confirm the signing of Jesse Lingard."" Ready for my new chapter ‚ú®ü§≤üèæ let‚Äôs gooo babyyyyyy @NFFC üî¥üå≥ #nottinghamforest pic.twitter.com/O4Q4mkThpN Lingard announced his move with a video shared on the social media site, writing in the caption: ""Ready for my new chapter. Let‚Äôs gooo babyyyyyy"". Forest have not declared the length of Lingard's contract. However, it has been reported that he has committed to a one-year contract with the club. Lingard could earn up to ¬£200,000 per week at Forest depending on bonuses, according to many outlets, but his base salary is much lower. Lingard came through the United youth academy and enjoyed loan spells at Leicester and Birmingham before he made his senior debut for the Red Devils in August 2014. He went on to make over 230 appearances for the club overall, including 22 matches throughout the 2021-22 campaign. His contract expired at the end of the season and West Ham and Forest emerged as candidates to snap him up. Juventus were also in the picture to sign the free agent but their interest cooled last month.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lingard-confirms-free-transfer-to-nottingham-forest-after/blt12f387ddd5d034c3,Peter McVitie,15f7e7ca-4a01-40bd-9943-8cf147de6d70
"De Bruyne, Salah... Guehi? Selling Crystal Palace captain could be Chelsea's latest transfer regret","Marc Guehi was asked ahead of Crystal Palace‚Äôs FA Cup semi-final date with Chelsea whether or not he was one of the best defenders in the Premier League. ""I‚Äôd say I am extremely far away,‚Äù he replied in the pre-match press conference. ‚ÄúI am nowhere near.‚Äù That humble approach to his development is just one reason Chelsea might end up with regrets about selling the centre-back last summer. ""It was the right answer,"" Palace coach Patrick Vieira said, causing the press room to laugh. ""He has the potential. That answer really tells you what kind of person he is. ""Yes, some people say these things but he really means it. You just have to look at him working every day in training by focusing on the details. He wants to be a better player. ""He has a massive chance to succeed because he is really prepared to work hard to improve himself. This is the type of player with huge potential and performing well [that we want to sign]. ""The interactions we have from him as staff are positive because he is prepared to do extra after training to try and improve. That makes our job easier."" Even nowadays, many Blues fans struggle to fathom how their club could have sold Kevin De Bruyne, Mohamed Salah and Romelu Lukaku only for them to go onto become stars of the European game. All three took a step back to smaller clubs from the Blues, before going on to huge achievements at other elite clubs. In the case of De Bruyne and Salah, they never returned to Chelsea, while Lukaku would come back for a club-record ¬£100 million ($136m) fee after winning a Scudetto with Inter. Like Guehi, those three players all had a humble, hard-working approach. His answer about being miles away from the top was something his manager liked to hear, but he does believe he will get there some day. The 21-year-old defender is showing signs of superstar trajectory after his move to Selhurst Park for just ¬£18 million ($24m). He has made more starts than any other player under Vieira (35), helping them to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, where he will face his former club on Sunday. ""It wasn't an easy decision for me to leave Chelsea,"" Guehi told GOAL on international duty earlier this season having been called up by England for the first time. ""For any young player that is really important, getting game time, that was all that mattered to me,‚Äù he said ahead of this weekend's match. ‚ÄúThe decision to leave Chelsea and come to Palace was the right one, to get that game time and show what I can do."" He has since taken the armband to become the youngest captain in the Premier League and the youngest at his club in a decade. And with 30 league games under his belt already, Guehi is the third-youngest defender in the top five European leagues to reach that number this season. Those statistics are unmatched by any other young English central defender. Guehi has shot up Gareth Southgate's pecking order, having graduated from the England's Under-21s, and is now above AC Milan's Fikayo Tomori, another Cobham academy graduate. It might be easy to overlook the Ivorian-born defender when you are singling out players for praise. He is not aggressive; instead he goes about his duties with a steely determination and class. You get the sense that he is always in control, using his well-renowned intelligence and speed rather than relying only on his strength to win duels. He is also an excellent ball-playing defender, capable of starting attacks, and he can chip in with goals from set-pieces too. Of course, this is not news to those who have been watching him closely at youth level. His pedigree has always been that of a thoroughbred defender. Southgate on Marc Guehi: ""Marc has had a really consistent season. We've been really impressed with him on and off the ball, in the biggest games, he has been very calm. We know him well from our jnr teams as a World Cup winner."" #ThreeLions #Eng Honed at both Cobham and St George's Park, he has been with England since the U15s and scored in the final while winning the U17 World Cup with Steve Cooper's England side. Shortly after, he would win the treble with the U18s at Chelsea in an exceptional season before making his first-team debut under Frank Lampard in 2019. Having now left the Blues, it looks like a mistake for the club to have lost him so cheaply. Guehi is already worth far more than the sum he was sold for. Chelsea have a sell-on clause, to earn more from any potential future sale, and have matching rights attached to his contract from 2023. It means should a club bid for Guehi from next season, Chelsea will have the right to match that offer. Like Lukaku, there is a pathway back for the homegrown star to return, but the Blues might feel a tinge of instant regret, with central defence as their primary problem position for the upcoming transfer market. Andreas Christesen is set to leave for Barcelona and there is continued uncertainty over the futures of both Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta. When asked by GOAL, Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel gave his view about the sale of Guehi. ‚ÄúIt is a decision we took together and are happy about these decisions,"" Tuchel said at Cobham. ""You cannot go back and reflect at this point. ""When we took the decisions it was the right thing to do given the circumstances. For Marc Guehi, it is a fantastic development. It is impossible now to say if we kept him he would have been better, been worse or been the same. ""Maybe he needed that (to leave). Maybe he needed the change of environment, a different club, a different role, more minutes to develop your full potential. ""It just tells you over and over again that if you trust younger players and have a role for them, they can on a very regular level match expectations and even over perform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see so many Chelsea players out there in every league. We are well aware of it. It is nice to play against them and see them develop.‚Äù Whether Tuchel feels the same on Sunday evening remains to be seen.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/de-bruyne-salah-guehi-crystal-palace-chelsea-transfer/blt1c674e362af40992,Nizaar Kinsella,227405a8-9a52-4583-bab7-8cc7c68f97bf
Pulisic reveals what Tuchel told him before USMNT international came on to score Chelsea's winner vs West Ham,"Christian Pulisic has revealed what Thomas Tuchel said to him before the USMNT international's dramatic late winner against West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. The forward came off the bench and proved the crucial key to unlocking the deadlock for the Blues at Stamford Bridge, as he struck late against a 10-men Hammers side to grab three vital points for the hosts. That steadies the ship for the club in their bid to cement their top-four status, and now, Pulisic has opened up on what was asked of him by his coach before he took to the pitch in search of a crucial contribution. ""He just said to make a difference,"" Pulisic stated in his post-match comments. ""To combine and make opportunities. ""It feels good to be more secure in the top four. We need a win at home and it feels great in front of our fans. We need to finish the season strong. ""[We've got] some good league games and then a final. I needed to come in and make a difference and show I want to be playing."" The forward's manager was delighted to see his player make the promised contribution asked of him, and addressed as much in his own post-match interview, while highlighting the contributions of Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech off the bench too. ""I am happy for him,"" he added. ""I told him he had a good impact. ""Romelu was involved with the penalty. Hakim was dangerous and Puli got the goal. He lacked confidence in recent matches.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-reveals-tuchel-usmnt-international-score-chelsea/blt6f5f391aca3ba541,Andrew Steel,ed6aa8d9-7749-4e98-94b4-d3a5437863c7
Don't tell us to shoot! Brighton manager Potter makes strange request to fans,"Brighton manager Graham Potter has made a bizarre request to the club‚Äôs supporters, asking them to refrain from shouting ""shoot"". The Seagulls drew another blank in their most recent game, a 0-0 draw at home to rock-bottom Norwich, despite firing in 30 shots. Only four of those were on target while Neal Maupay missed a first-half penalty, and the south coast outfit have found the target only once in their last seven Premier League games. With his side short on firepower, Potter has said of the added pressure being piled on by fans: ""The build-up suggests we‚Äôre getting there. Of course, the longer you go, you can hear the crowd, ‚Äòshoot, shoot, shoot‚Äô, and that sometimes is a challenge for the players. ""Because sometimes there‚Äôs an opportunity to shoot - sometimes it‚Äôs a chance for the block and then the transition. Sometimes maybe one more pass gets you in a better position but, if you miss the pass, you should have shot."" Potter added: ""It‚Äôs just one of those things that we‚Äôre going through. A bit of pain and a bit of suffering. So that does affect confidence. It affects a little bit of the final bit. ""It‚Äôs the Premier League and Premier League defenders - it isn‚Äôt so straightforward to create chances and score."" Brighton‚Äôs last victory came away at Watford on February 12, with only two top-flight wins in 2022. They sit 13th in the Premier League table, 12 points clear of the drop zone. Potter‚Äôs men will be back in action on Saturday with a trip to top-four hopefuls Arsenal, while their two games after will also be on the road at Tottenham and Manchester City.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dont-tell-us-to-shoot-brighton-manager-potter-fans/bltec5719a24c3e48da,Chris Burton,afad6496-58ae-425e-a254-d883c2ebde9f
Kane praised by England LGBT fan group for 'hugely important' comments on Qatar human rights record,"Harry Kane has been praised by the England LGBT+ fan group for his comments about the World Cup being held in Qatar and the issue this causes for gay supporters. FIFA have also been condemned for not doing enough to ensure fans felt safe enough to go and protecting minorities from potential harm. Earlier this week Kane said all fans should feel comfortable at the World Cup regardless of sexuality, with his words praised by supporters. Kane said: ""As a nation we want our fans to enjoy the tournament as much as we hopefully enjoy the tournament, and we want them to feel safe and free to watch the games how they please and act how they want to act. A Three Lions Pride spokesman told the Mirror: ""Having players using their platform to raise human rights issues is hugely important - the work that groups like ours do is often unnoticed and players with their reach and platforms amplifying the concerns and work others do in human rights is extremely helpful. ""This England squad, as we saw during the Euros, is not just one that‚Äôs great on the pitch but is engaged and empathetic off it too. I don‚Äôt think the human rights issues in Qatar will be brushed under the carpet but it‚Äôs not just the responsibility of the squad, but the broader FA, media and fans to keep raising these issues and shining a light on the human rights abuses that exist. ""FIFA and the Qatari SC should have been better at engaging and coming forth with concrete proposals around fan safety, particularly for trans and gender diverse fans to ensure their safety. Instead, what we‚Äôve seen is sound bites of a 'World Cup for everyone' with little to no detail on how fans will be protected and remain safe. ""FIFA have a human rights aspect to their bidding process now but how it works and is applied in practice remains to be clearly seen. Governing bodies can, and should, be doing more to ensure that the greatest tournaments in football are not being used to sportswash over human rights abuses. ""Whether that‚Äôs on LGBT+ legislation or whether it‚Äôs on the persecution of minorities such as the Uyghurs - football should be taking a stand for human rights, not allowing prestigious tournaments to be hosted in countries who neglect the core values of solidarity, inclusivity and integrity. Nobody should be alienated or excluded from engaging in the sport we love because of who they are.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kane-england-lgbt-fan-group-qatar-human-rights/blt54394062fa095a7b,Marwan Harraz,ce212b5f-9d95-4266-aa70-bd700628b8e1

Describing the comeback as ""perfect"", the Brentford playmaker indicated that he feels comfortable back with his international team-mates and is ready to help at the 2022 World Cup. ‚ÄúI was pleased to show I can still play,"" Eriksen told Dutch TV.

Onuachu hits 21st goal of the season as Genk recover to defeat Sporting Charleroi,"Nigeria international Paul Onuachu continued with his goal-scoring form after notching in Genk's 3-2 win against Sporting Charleroi in the European qualification play-off fixture at Cegeka Arena on Tuesday. It was the visiting Charleroi, who took the lead against the run of play when Malagasy international Marco Ilaimaharitra hit the back of the net in the 34th minute for a 1-0 lead at the half-time break. After the break, the 27-year-old Super Eagle pulled the Smurfs level with a clinical finish in the 55th minute, and they doubled their lead courtesy of an own goal from Ken Nkuba in the 59th minute. Carlos Cuesta then put Genk 3-1 up in the 65th minute and despite a late rally which saw Charleroi reduce the deficit courtesy of Daan Heymans in the 72nd minute, it was not enough to hand them something from the game. Having scored in the previous game against the same side, Onuachu was retained in the starting XI by German coach Bernd Storck and he almost gave his team the lead with only nine minutes played when he rattled the woodwork after being put through by Ghana international Joseph Paintsil. But against the run of play, Charleroi took the lead when Ilaimaharitra raced to tap in a cross from Ivory Coast player Vakoun Issouf Bayo past goalkeeper Tobe Leysen. Genk did not give up as they kept pressing their opponents and it was no surprise when Onuachu reacted fast to drive home a well-delivered cross from Junya Ito. Four minutes later, Genk went 2-1 up when Nkuba turned the ball into his own net while trying to clear a dangerous cross and six minutes later, they scored their third, this time Cuesta inscribed his name on the scoresheet. Charleroi continued to fight and they were rewarded with a goal with 18 minutes left to the final whistle when Heymans tapped home but Genk held on to register another win. The Super Eagle has now netted 21 goals in this First Division A season, which ranks him third overall in this category in 2021-22, while also making him the top league scorer for his side. In addition, he has chipped in with two assists.

Nevertheless, the 56-year-old talked about why he went for the former Malmo FF man instead of Ogenyi Onazi, who represents Saudi Arabia second-tier side Al Adalah. ""I picked Bonke outside the players on standby because Ndidi is a defensive midfielder and there is just a defensive midfielder on the standby list. Bonke has been a player in my heart.

Man City boss Guardiola hails 'incredible' pilot as he details 'scary' aeroplane flight that had to be diverted to Liverpool ,"Pep Guardiola has hailed the ""incredible"" pilot who helped steer Manchester City's flight back to safety amid Storm Dudley on Thursday, after they were forced to divert to Liverpool amid appalling weather conditions. The Citizens were returning from their Champions League last-16 trip to Sporting CP, where Bernardo Silva helped inspire them to a rampant 5-0 rout to seize a likely insurmountable first-leg advantage. Yet their trip was not without peril as they were caught in the throes of the one-two punch of Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice that has battered most of north-western Europe over the past few days - and now Guardiola has opened up on the ""scary"" experience after seeing footage of the side's plane attempt to land at Manchester Airport. ‚ÄúWell, to be honest when I saw after the video I said ‚Äòwow‚Äô,"" the Spaniard told his pre-match press conference ahead of his side's clash with Tottenham this weekend. ""It was more scary and we felt that. ""It was bumping a lot, many times, but there was a moment going down and immediately the engines started to roll on and you go up. Somehing happened but the pilot was incredible, he talked to us and was so calm. The pilot was magnificent. We felt a little bit anxious in there air but thanks to the way he talked to us, everyone was calm.‚Äù Asked about how many times his side attempted to arrive in their home city, Guardiola stated they tried just one descent before opting for Liverpool, with the manager cheekily stating he got a warm welcome in the city of his main title rivals, adding: ‚ÄúFor sure, they are always so kind to us. They have a better airport than us!‚Äù Pressed on his plans for the visit of a Spurs side in freefall, Guardiola acknowledged that Storm Eunice has played havoc with his training plans, but that the injured Jack Grealish is unlikely to return following his shin problem. ‚ÄúWe are going to train now in two hours,"" he added. ""Hopefully, with the wind we cannot miss players flying to the sky. We‚Äôll see ""I think [Grealish's] shin is much less [of an issue] than he had last season in Birmingham but still I didn‚Äôt speak with the doctor.

USMNT full back Reynolds leaves Roma to join Belgian side Westerlo on loan,"U.S. men's national team full back Bryan Reynolds has signed with Belgian side Westerlo on a season-long loan as the former FC Dallas star searches for playing time away from Roma. Reynolds spent the second half of last season on loan with KV Kortrijk and will now spend the entirety of 2022-23 season in Belgium.

Great players in Leah Williamson, Lucy Bronze, an excellent midfield. ‚ÄúIt's a team that will put us under pressure early with the high press and when we get the ball in their half, they're a team that are quite adept at defending deeply to fluff out the opposition's threats. ‚ÄúOverall, I expect the game played at a very high pace, great intensity, just like the kind that you would see in the Women's Super League in England and also in the Spanish league too. I think it will be an excellent game and we are really looking forward to tomorrow. ‚ÄúIt potentially could be the best game of the tournament, in my opinion.‚Äù Asked if there is anything he is afraid of, Vilda responded: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not particularly scared of anything. ‚ÄúWe know what their strengths are. We know they've got a lot of them, but we also know what their weaknesses are. These are the things that we've pinpointed in training and been watching in the footage of previous matches - and these are the things that we will try to exploit to turn the game and the result in our favour.‚Äù Spain midfielder Alexia Putellas, who won the Ballon d‚ÄôOr last year, also spoke highly of Sunday‚Äôs opponents ahead of the game. ‚ÄúEngland are a great team, one of the best in the world. I always love playing against big teams like them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe haven't always beaten them when we've played them. We haven't had that luck all the time. But tomorrow, who knows what will happen? I'm just really looking forward to the game and the challenge ahead. ‚ÄúI believe that we have improved a lot since [we last played England at] the 2020 SheBelieves Cup. We are a better team now. ‚ÄúTomorrow will be a really tough test. It will be a really high-quality contest. We'll need to be at the top of our game to win. ‚ÄúWe need to do the little things right. The minor details will make a massive difference tomorrow. Just like the other day, we need to go out there clearly with the plan that we've prepared in mind and execute it well. We didn't get the result that we quite wanted the other day with the late equaliser. ‚ÄúJust like Germany, England are going to come with a game plan and be quite resolute and difficult to break down and tough to beat. It will be a close game so we need to do everything we can. ‚ÄúWe also need to play well and try to quieten down the crowd because there'll be a lot of fans on England's side, like there will be in the Euros this summer. That is exactly what we need to do if we're going to be on the right side of the result come the end of the game tomorrow.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/best-england-team-ever-spain-coach-jorge-vilda/blt0f4c810134881bb7,Ame√© Ruszkai,3cdb8399-0b97-4867-b1a1-32d7987d2e7c
Pulisic won‚Äôt let Sterling transfer impact Chelsea future as USMNT star embraces added competition,"Christian Pulisic is happy to compete with Raheem Sterling for regular game time at Chelsea, rather than run away from that challenge and consider pushing for a transfer elsewhere. The United States international has seen further attacking reinforcements drafted in to Stamford Bridge during the current window. An England international with four Premier League titles to his name has been snapped up from Manchester City, but the presence of another proven performer on the flanks will not force a USMNT forward towards the exits in west London. A talented 23-year-old has told ESPN of seeing Thomas Tuchel splash out ¬£47.5 million ($57m) on a player that tends to operate in the same left-wing berth that he favours: ‚ÄúGreat quality. We‚Äôre really excited about it. ‚ÄúThe beautiful thing about being at a club like this is the competition every single day. We all thrive competing with each other in training and getting to play with each other is just another great addition to the team. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt change a whole lot [for me], I‚Äôm still going to have to play hard and earn my position, just like I did before, nothing crazy has changed. ‚ÄúThis is Chelsea, this is what you signed up for, this is the kind of club it is with the calibre of players that we have.‚Äù Chelsea's attack has a new leader üî• pic.twitter.com/rxbJGFaykM Pulisic took in 38 appearances for Chelsea across all competitions last season, taking him to 115 in total for the Blues across three campaigns, with his versatility often being put to good use. Injuries and rotation have stunted his progress at times, but a man that will be leading his country into the World Cup finals later this year as national team captain believes he can play a regular role. Pulisic added on his ambition for 2022-23: ""Of course, I want to get more playing time. I want to be on the field as much as I can and be the sharpest I can be and fit as well. ‚ÄúI think I still got a lot of games. But it's always something that I'm working at and trying to be regular at club level as well to put myself in the best position to be fit when I come here with my national team.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-sterling-transfer-impact-chelsea-future-usmnt/blt92ef1f7bb66167f7,Chris Burton,531b02da-2f96-4fe9-be4a-3f5826a3ef9c
'Did anyone really care?' - Klopp questions football's Abramovich stance and calls for more checks on club owners,"Jurgen Klopp has accused football, and football supporters, of turning a blind eye to the origin of Roman Abramovich‚Äôs wealth. And the Liverpool manager believes the game, and those involved within it, must do more to ensure serious questions are asked of club owners, and specifically where their money has come from, in the future. Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government on Thursday, with the Chelsea owner cited as having a close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The developments have sent shockwaves through the Premier League, and left the current European champions facing an uncertain future, to say the least. Speaking at a press conference on Friday, ahead of Liverpool‚Äôs weekend trip to Brighton, Klopp expressed sympathy for Chelsea‚Äôs players and staff, stressing that it is Putin who is responsible for the situation the club finds itself in.¬† And later, he spoke further on the issue, and specifically of football‚Äôs duty to better police those who own clubs. He told reporters: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it is really fair to ask me. You are much longer in this country. Did you care, really? Did anyone really care when Roman Abramovich came to Chelsea? ‚ÄúDid anyone really care when Newcastle got taken over? Do supporters really care? It is a question.¬† ‚ÄúIt is pretty obvious where the money is coming from. Everyone knew it, but we accepted it. That‚Äôs our fault. It is society‚Äôs fault, so we accepted it.¬† ‚ÄúNow we cannot accept it anymore and so we punish them, it is not Chelsea‚Äôs fault. Not at all.‚Äù Klopp added: ‚ÄúI have no idea what background checks would look like, but I can tell you I am six and a half years here and from the first day I came here I was really happy with our owners, and in these times I am even more happy with our owners.¬† ‚ÄúIn the end, owners are there to lead the club, to give financial resources when they want to make a benefit.¬† ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even think about where the money is coming from, [but] now we start obviously thinking about where the money is coming from. I think that is a good idea to be honest. We should think about that a bit more.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/did-anyone-really-care-klopp-questions-football-abramovich/blt30439fda0b865581,Neil Jones,2e2a45da-6115-4e9a-9021-1af2d8e7560e
"Djiku eclipses Andre Ayew, what next for Ghana centre-back?","Ghana have a strong and proud tradition in the French top flight‚ÄîLigue 1‚Äîwith some of the Black Stars‚Äô greatest ever players gracing the division over the years. From Abedi Pele, Andre Ayew and Jordan Ayew with Olympique de Marseille to historic contributions like Anthony Baffoe and Michael Essien, many of the country‚Äôs stars have thrived in France. Latterly, the likes of Kamaldeen Sulemana, Majeed Waris and Gideon Mensah have impressed in Ligue 1, although no Black Star to have featured in the division can eclipse Alexander Djiku, who broke the Ghanaian record for appearances in the French top flight. üá¨üá≠ Ghanaian appearances in Ligue 1 üá´üá∑@alex_djiku 183@AyewAndre 182@jordan_ayew9 159@AyewAbedi  151@marceldesailly 148@warisgh10 142@MichaelEssien 137Boye 122@ASAMOAH_GYAN3 48@Jomens25 44@AnthonyBaffoe 34@Kamaldeenho10 20@babarahmangh 11@FreddyAdu 9 pic.twitter.com/fOo5yukRth The centre-back broke Dede‚Äôs record of 182 outings last weekend, when he made his 183rd league appearance in Ligue 1. It‚Äôs an impressive feat for the defender considering some of the great Ghanaian names to have played in the division, and it‚Äôs testament to the stopper‚Äôs longevity in one of the world‚Äôs most competitive leagues. The 27-year-old made his Ligue 1 debut while on the books of Corsican side SC Bastia‚ÄîEssien‚Äôs alma mater‚Äîin the 2014-15 season, and has featured consistently across the next six campaigns. Following time at the Furiani, he moved on to SM Caen, before signing for current club Racing Club Strasbourg Alsace in 2019. It‚Äôs here that Djiku has moved from being a player regularly battling the drop‚Äîhe‚Äôs twice been relegated‚Äîto one competing for the top three. By the halfway point of the season, only one player had made more interceptions across Europe‚Äôs big five leagues‚ÄîAS Monaco‚Äôs Aurelien Tchouameni‚Äîwith Djiku demonstrating why he‚Äôs been compared to Liverpool centre-back Virgil van Dijk. Indeed, heading into the weekend‚Äôs fixtures, ahead of Sunday‚Äôs meeting with Olympique Lyonnais‚Äîcurrently struggling in midtable‚ÄîStrasbourg sit fourth in the table, hot on the heels of Stade Rennais in third. European football would be a fitting next step for the centre-back, who is entering his prime years and has demonstrated an admirable level of consistency during the course of his Ligue 1 career to date. Djiku has already showed in recent years that he belongs at international level, having first made his debut when international football resumed in the Autumn of 2020. Things didn‚Äôt start strongly‚Äîwith that miserable 3-0 friendly defeat by Mali‚Äîbut things have steadily improved, through the tenures of CK Akonnor, Milovan Rajevac, Otto Addo, and now, Chris Hughton. Djiku has had his tough moments‚Äînotably that 3-2 Africa Cup of Nations defeat by Comoros‚Äîand only five of his 16 international outings have been competitive victories. However, the defender came into his own during those two World Cup qualifying draws against Nigeria, enjoying the tussle with Victor Osimhen and forging a fine partnership with Daniel Amartey. With Dennis Odoi and Mensah now forming a defensive unit ahead of Joseph Wollacott, and Iddrisu Baba protecting from midfield, Ghana can start to build a strong platform as they look to tackle a tricky World Cup group. Perhaps even Southampton‚Äôs Mohammed Salisu will be added to the mix before Qatar. While he continues to excel in Ligue 1, Montpellier-born Djiku isn‚Äôt closed to potential opportunities beyond l‚ÄôHexagone. ""I've spoken a lot with Andre Ayew, Jordan Ayew and Thomas Partey,‚Äù he told Sky Sports last month. ‚ÄúThey have enjoyed the Premier League so much since they have been here.  ‚ÄúIt's a spectacular league that gives you the opportunity to express yourself and it's often a very open game,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt's one of the best leagues in the world and obviously this makes you want to try it one day.‚Äù For now, Ligue 1; next season, perhaps the World Cup and the Champions League‚Ä¶beyond that, does the Premier League beckon?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/djiku-eclipses-andre-ayew-what-next-for-ghana-centre-back/blt0e1474c661d85dae,Ed Dove,f13baf0d-17a2-4efc-9f61-15ed7e075cd5
"Paul Pogba, a witch doctor & blackmail: What is happening with former Man Utd star & his brother?","Paul Pogba is accustomed to generating headlines, with the enigmatic midfielder once the most expensive footballer on the planet, but few could have predicted that he would become caught up in a saga involving supposed blackmail and accusations of witchcraft. The France international‚Äôs own brother, Mathias, has threatened to blow the lid on a remarkable story, with family feuds adding another intriguing subplot to the drama. What has been said, when, why and who by? GOAL casts an eye over a series of unfortunate events that have brought the World Cup winner, who swapped Manchester United for Juventus during the summer of 2022, screaming back into the spotlight. Mathias Pogba delivered a bombshell announcement that came out of the blue on August 28, with a video posted on social media translated into four languages. It promised ‚Äúexplosive revelations‚Äù about Juve star Paul Pogba so that his loyal fan base can ‚Äúdecide, knowingly, if he really deserves the admiration, respect and love of the public, if he deserves his place in the France team, if he deserves to start at Juventus, if he is a trustworthy person.‚Äù Mathias, who has five international caps for Guinea and was last on the books of French side Belfort, also vowed to disclose revelations about lawyer Rafaela Pimenta ‚Äì who has been charged with the task of managing Pogba‚Äôs career following the death of Italian agent Mino Raiola. Kylian Mbappe was also unwittingly dragged into the discussion, with the Paris Saint-Germain forward ‚Äì who is an international colleague of Pogba ‚Äì alleged to have been the subject of an apparent 'witchcraft' request. Pogba did not take kindly to seeing his name and image dragged through the mud and sought immediate legal advice, with a statement released by his lawyers stating: ""Mathias Pogba's recent statements on social networks are unfortunately not a surprise. ""They come on top of threats and extortion attempts by an organised gang against Paul Pogba. The competent authorities in Italy and France were informed a month ago and there will be no further comments on the ongoing investigation."" An investigation into an alleged extortion attempt was opened in August, with France Info obtaining a copy of Pogba‚Äôs hearings. It is claimed that the 29-year-old midfielder told police that he was taken to an apartment in the suburbs of Paris and threatened by hooded men armed with assault rifles. His attackers are said to have demanded ‚Ç¨13 million (¬£11m/$13m) for ""service rendered"", namely protection ""in all discretion"" since the start of Pogba‚Äôs career. These individuals then reportedly invited themselves unannounced to training sessions at Manchester United and Juventus, where more intimidation tactics were carried out. Pogba claims to have recognised his brother in the company of the gangs ‚Äì one that he eventually paid ‚Ç¨100,000 to after being threatened with the public release of accusations that would be more damaging to his image. Pogba claims that his blackmailers wish to discredit him by claiming that he sought the assistance of a witch doctor when attempting to put a curse on France colleague Mbappe. Mathias Pogba said in a series of social media posts: ‚ÄúWhat I was waiting for has happened: my little brother is finally starting to show his real face. ‚ÄúSince he is the one who started talking lies to the police and who is getting the info out, you can't blame me for anything. You really wanted to silence me, even if it means lying and sending me to prison.‚Äù He added: ""Kylian, do you understand now? I have nothing against you, what I am saying is for your good, everything is true and known, the witch doctor is known! ‚ÄúSorry for this brother, a so-called Muslim up to his neck in witchcraft.‚Äù Paul Pogba has denied any involvement with a witch doctor, but L‚ÄôEquipe reports that a video exists which supports Mathias‚Äô claims. Pogba is currently sidelined through injury, but he is hoping to be back in time to secure his spot in France‚Äôs squad for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar. Any issue with Mbappe, who is said to be keeping a ‚Äúwatchful eye‚Äù on events from afar, could put that position under threat. Didier Deschamps is set to name his next squad on September 15, which is likely to see Pogba miss out due to a lack of game time. He does, however, have big decisions to make prior to Les Bleus opening the defence of their global crown on November 22 against Australia. Noel Le Graet, president of the French Football Federation (FFF), has said: ‚ÄúI love Paul. I hope that this does not call into question his place in the France team. At this stage these are just rumours‚Äù.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/paul-pogba-witch-doctor-blackmail-what-happening-man-utd/blta3aa0a822e21088a,Chris Burton,0c2f7b6d-59f7-4538-81ca-d05d0815de0f
"Manchester United vs Brighton: Predictions, odds & betting tips ","Manchester United hope to put an end to their three-game winless run when they take on Brighton in the Premier League on Tuesday. The Red Devils have slipped up against Middlesbrough, Burnley and Southampton in recent games and face a difficult test at home against Brighton.  But the visiting team have not lost in seven Premier League matches and will fancy their chances at Old Trafford. At 8/11 (1.73) with bet365, Manchester United are the favourites to win the match. Brighton are available at 15/4 (4.75) and the draw is priced at 11/4 (3.75). Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo is available to open the scoring at 3/1 (4.0) and bring an end to his run of six games without a goal in all competitions. Neal Maupay is the lowest-priced Brighton player at 6/1 (7.0) to get the first goal of the match. Edinson Cavani, Eric Bailly and Nemanja Matic are all out injured for Ralf Rangnick's team. The home side have a point to prove after a run of disappointing performances and results. They have dropped out of the Premier League's top four and are desperate for all three points from this game to get them back in the Champions League places. Brighton, however, have not been beaten in the league in 2022 and will feel like they can cause trouble for the Old Trafford outfit. Enock Mwepu and Jeremy Sarmiento are both out injured for the visitors but Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Trossard are available after recovering from Covid-19. There have been less than 2.5 goals in Brighton's last four Premier League matches and 12 of their last 13.

'I want to play at the 2022 World Cup'- Arsenal's NXGN star Flores eyeing Gunners debut and further Mexico honours,"It has been a whirlwind 12 months for Marcelo Flores. Arsenal‚Äôs teenage attacker was still playing Under-18s football this time last year, with his U23s debut for the Gunners not arriving until the final day of the 2020-21 season. But since then, he has not looked back. In a matter of months, the impressive 18-year-old has established himself as a key player for Arsenal's U23s, trained regularly with Mikel Arteta‚Äôs senior squad and also made his mark on the international scene. Flores was the star of the show in November when he scored two goals in three games to inspire Mexico U20s to glory in the inaugural Revelations Cup. His performances captured the imagination of a nation, with widespread calls for the teenager to be handed his full senior debut by Mexico boss Gerardo Martino soon following. And Martino answered those calls in December, when Flores was included in his squad for a friendly against Chile in the United States. The Gunners forward was brought on with seven minutes remaining of the 2-2 draw, capping what had been a remarkable few months for a player who does not even turn 19 until October. ‚ÄúMaking my Mexico debut is a night I‚Äôll never forget,‚Äù Flores exclusively tells GOAL during an interview to mark his inclusion on the NXGN 2022 list of the world's best teenage footballers. ‚ÄúAll the players took me in well. Some of them were older, but I was really close with them and I trained really well. ‚ÄúTo come on was a very special moment for me and my family. Thanks to the manager for giving me the opportunity.‚Äù As the friendly was not classed as a competitive international, Flores could still choose to represent Canada - the country of his birth - or England. A final decision has yet to be taken, although right now he admits his focus is firmly on Mexico. And for a player with lofty ambitions, the experiences he has enjoyed this season - both internationally and with Arsenal - have left him thirsty for more. ‚ÄúI would like to make my Premier League debut before I turn 19,‚Äù Flores says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my goal.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôd like to get my proper international debut for Mexico and hopefully be involved in the Qatar World Cup. ‚ÄúI idolise players like [Lionel] Messi, [Cristiano] Ronaldo and Neymar, who have all done the same thing. ‚ÄúLooking up to players like them, you want to match what they did because like any player, my ultimate dream is to win things like the Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.‚Äù Born in Ontario, Canada, Flores cannot remember a time when he didn‚Äôt have a ball at his feet. Football has always been ingrained in his family. His father, Ruben, was born in Mexico City and played for Atlante in the Mexican Primera Division from 1988 to 1990. His mother also played and his two sisters, Tatiana and Silvana, now play for Chelsea and Tottenham, respectively, and have also represented Mexico at youth level. ‚ÄúI started when I was really young,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMy dad always had a lot of his football friends around, so everyone loved football. ‚ÄúI started kicking a ball when I was really young and I never lost my love for it. I was a really energetic kid and playing football just made me happy. ‚ÄúBarcelona was my favourite club. My mum tells me that I never used to take off the shirt. ‚ÄúWhen I was young my dad took me to a couple of games at Camp Nou. I used to love Ronaldinho.‚Äù Flores‚Äô early football memories are of him and his sisters leaving school early to rush back home and watch Champions League fixtures on TV. They grew up supporting Pep Guardiola‚Äôs Barcelona team, and would all pack into their front room to see their heroes in action. For Flores, it was all about seeing one man. ‚ÄúI idolised Messi,‚Äù he reveals. ‚ÄúFor my sisters, it was Alexis Sanchez and [Andres] Iniesta. We just loved coming home and watching such a good team play. ‚ÄúI used to love those days when the Champions League was on. It‚Äôs such a good memory.‚Äù Growing up in Canada, Flores spent a lot of time playing his football at the Guelph Soccer Academy, where his dad was technical director. But his big break arrived in 2015, when he travelled over to the Cayman Islands with his father, who was coaching the women's national team at the time. While they were there, Flores took part in a soccer school being run by a man who scouted for Ipswich Town. His performances caught the eye, and he was soon invited for a trial by the English side. The young attacker impressed enough during his time in England to be offered a permanent place in the Ipswich academy, and eventually he and his family took the decision to all move to England permanently. ‚ÄúThe first year was really difficult,‚Äù Flores recalls. ‚ÄúI was playing well, but being a Canadian kid, it was hard at first getting used to the English style and interacting with the English boys. ‚ÄúBut I just stuck to my football and in the second year I put a lot of hours in as my dad became one of the coaches there. ‚ÄúSo on Saturdays and Sundays I would be there all day, and after school I would be there as well. I was training really hard on my own and with the team and it ended up paying off. ‚ÄúI started doing really well and then a lot of options opened up.‚Äù Clubs across England were now on Flores‚Äô trail, with both Liverpool and Manchester City keen to sign him But it was Arsenal who won the race for the young forward in 2018 after they mapped out the clear pathway to the first-team they saw for him at the club. So he moved to the Gunners‚Äô famous Hale End academy and would spend his days looking at the pictures on the walls of players who had gone on to make their mark with the first-team at Arsenal. ‚ÄúEvery day you go to training and walk past those photos,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the ultimate dream, so every day you give the best you can to improve yourself because you know it can pay off. ‚ÄúIt is an inspiration. Seeing players who have broken through shows you that there is a pathway and if you keep doing what you are doing, hopefully you can get there too.‚Äù It was not long before Flores started to make his mark at Arsenal. He was handed his first professional contract in July 2020, and made the move over from Hale End to the club‚Äôs main training centre at London Colney. After a series of eye-catching performances with the U18s, he got his chance with the U23s and has become an increasingly influential figure at that level since the start of the campaign. After waiting for his opportunity, Flores has started to flourish under new coach Kevin Betsy, and his performances have caught the eye of Mikel Arteta, who has invited the forward over to train with the first team on several occasions in recent months. ‚ÄúThe first time I ever went, I was 16 or 17,‚Äù Flores says. ‚ÄúI really enjoyed playing FIFA at that time so suddenly training with all these players that I used to play with on FIFA was kind of surreal. ‚ÄúObviously you get used to it, but at first it was really cool and you realise just how much better they are when you play with them in person. ‚ÄúEvery time you go, you just want to show your best to the manager and the players, and that‚Äôs what I will keep doing.‚Äù ùóßùóµùóÆùòÅ finish üí•ùóßùóµùóÆùòÅ celebration ü§ØTake it away, Marcelo Flores üòéüá≤üáΩ#AFCU21 | @PapaJohnsTrophy üèÜ pic.twitter.com/9l31HJmd9a Given his progress through from Hale End, it is no surprise that Flores has huge respect for what Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe have achieved during the past couple of years. He has developed a close bond with both, and is full of thanks for the advice he has received from them as he looks to follow in their footsteps. ‚ÄúBukayo and Emile have been through what I‚Äôm going through now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey understand and they take you under their wing, give you advice and help you out a lot. ‚ÄúBukayo went straight through to the first team, which is amazing, but for Emile, who went on loan twice, it was a bit harder pathway for him. ‚ÄúBut to see him come through now, get the No.10 shirt for Arsenal, which is my dream as well. It‚Äôs a big thing. ‚ÄúIt shows if you put the time in it can pay off.‚Äù For Flores, the focus now is on finishing what has been a breakthrough season as strongly as possible. The 2021-22 campaign has given him a taste of what could be to come, but he is well aware that there is still much to do if he is to achieve some of the lofty targets he has set himself. The past 12 months, though, have certainly shown that anything is possible when it comes to Arsenal‚Äôs talented young forward.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-arsenal-nxgn-star-flores-gunners-debut-mexico/blt3c078530516fce25,Charles Watts,b82970a9-8ab2-4f5b-896d-6fae0a34b969
"A flexible, big-game grafter: Jesus is the answer to Arsenal's prayers","Arsenal are set to land four-time Premier League winner Gabriel Jesus after agreeing a ¬£45 million ($55m) deal with Manchester City.  The Brazilian was Mikel Arteta's priority attacking target and there is, quite rightly, plenty of excitement around his imminent arrival at the Emirates.  So, below, GOAL looks at what can the Gunners expect from a player that became a sensation when he joined City as a teenager and then dazzled, but occasionally frustrated, in the intervening years...",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/gabriel-jesus-transfer-arsenal-learn-manchester-city/bltbf38a8bcbf39b094,Jonathan Smith,21d38744-d15a-4135-aba9-ac9c6ab2c381
Barcelona's 'gift from heaven' - Did Arsenal make a massive mistake letting Aubameyang leave for nothing?,"‚ÄúA gift from heaven.‚Äù That is how Barcelona boss Xavi described Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang earlier this month following his sensational start to life in Spain. And when you consider the Gabon international has kicked off his Barca career with eight goals in 11 appearances, it is no surprise to hear that everyone at Camp Nou is delighted by the way their January capture has settled. At the weekend, Aubameyang even marked his El Clasico debut with two more goals as a revitalised Barcelona stunned La Liga leaders Real Madrid with a thumping 4-0 success at the Bernabeu. It was a win that generated headlines around the world and Xavi‚Äôs ""gift from heaven"" was at the heart of it. ""Hello from the finished player,‚Äù Aubameyang posted on social media after the victory, in what appeared to be a clear message to those who believed his best days were behind him following his difficulties at Arsenal during the first half of the season. The 30-year-old has been reborn in Spain. His smile is back and the goals are flowing. So, did Arsenal make a massive mistake letting him go in January? The simple answer is no. The fact is this is one of those rare occasions when a transfer works out perfectly for all concerned. Aubameyang has his mojo back, Barcelona have landed themselves a top striker and Arsenal have improved immeasurably in his absence. It‚Äôs been a win-win for everyone involved. Whether that stays the case at Arsenal remains to be seen, because questions will undoubtedly be asked about the wisdom of allowing Aubameyang to leave should they go on to miss out on Champions League qualification during the final 10 games of the season. However, for now, there is a steadfast belief around the north London club that the decision was the correct one. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely grateful for what Auba has done,‚Äù Mikel Arteta said soon after Aubameyang‚Äôs departure. ‚ÄúThe way I see myself in that relationship is the solution, not the problem. I've been the solution, 100 per cent. I can look in the eye of anybody.¬† ‚ÄúThe intention all the time is the best and not for me, it's for the club and the team. ‚ÄúYou have to make a decision that the best thing to do was let him move on and now he plays for Barcelona. It ended up the best possible way for everyone, I think.‚Äù Indeed, it's difficult to think of many transfers that end up pleasing all parties. It was clear going into the transfer window that his time with the Gunners had come to an end. He had already been banished by Arteta following the latest in a long line of disciplinary breaches and so hadn‚Äôt featured since the 2-1 defeat at Everton on December 6. So, when January arrived, it was just a case of trying to find the striker a new club. It looked like Arsenal‚Äôs attempts to find a bidder were going to prove unsuccessful as the month progressed, only for Barcelona to enter the equation with just days remaining. As the deadline approached, the talks intensified.¬† OFFICIAL: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leaves Arsenal to join Barcelona on a free transfer üîµüî¥ pic.twitter.com/298bLdIO4h They were initially centred around a loan, only for the discussions to shift towards a permanent deal in the final hours of the window due to disagreements over what percentage of Aubameyang‚Äôs wages Barcelona would cover. When the deal was eventually announced, there was plenty of surprise that Arsenal had ended up releasing Aubameyang from his contract 18 months early and given him away on a free transfer. But the Gunners were more than satisfied with that outcome.¬† They may not have received any transfer fee for their former captain, but they had saved up to ¬£18 million ($24m) in wages and rid themselves of a problem they thought they would have to revisit in the summer. ‚ÄúWe wish him the best and we move on without any regrets,‚Äù Arteta said. ‚ÄúI prefer to look at all the beautiful things and good times that we had. ""It‚Äôs important to learn and look back at what you could have done better, especially from my side. ""I think [the squad has been] very understanding, they knew what was happening and it‚Äôs a good solution for everyone."" For whatever reason, it was clear that Aubameyang had lost his spark at Arsenal. His form prior to his exit was patchy at best and big chances were being wasted that you would usually expect him to take with ease. In his last 40 games for the Gunners in all competitions, he failed to score in 28 of them. And those around him were also struggling to find the net when he was the player at the head of Arteta‚Äôs attack. However, things have changed dramatically since Arsenal‚Äôs defeat at Goodison Park in December, which was Aubameyang‚Äôs final appearance.¬† Arteta‚Äôs side have taken 31 points from a possible 39 in the Premier League, losing just twice ‚Äì to Manchester City and Liverpool. Arsenal averaged just 1.2 goals per game prior to Aubameyang‚Äôs final appearance at Everton. Since then, with Alexandre Lacazette playing as the central striker, they average 2.0. They are also averaging more shots (16.8 compared to 14.0), more shots on target (5.4 to 4.8) and more touches in the opposition box (31.8 to 23.1). Possession has increased to 54.0 per cent compared to 49.1% and, most importantly, they are now averaging 2.4 points per game, compared to just 1.5 previously. The upturn in form and results is clear for all to see and the statistics paint a similar picture when you look at Aubameyang‚Äôs personal output before and after his move. In all competitions this season, he was averaging 0.6 goals per 90 minutes for Arsenal, but that has gone up to 1.1 with Barcelona. He is taking more shots (4.0 compared to 3.2), having more touches in the opposition box (6.7 compared to 4.7) and his shot conversion rate has increased from just 18% to 28.1%. But it‚Äôs not just what he‚Äôs doing on the pitch at Barcelona that has caught the eye, he has also surprised everyone behind the scenes as well. Staff at the Spanish giants have been hugely impressed with how he adapted his new surroundings, the way he is approaching training and the work he is putting in. The switch has given Aubameyang a new lease of life and Barcelona are now reaping the benefits of having one of Europe‚Äôs most prolific strikers leading their attack. ‚ÄúSometimes everyone benefits from a separation,‚Äù Aubameyang said on social media earlier this month. ‚Äú[The] most important [thing] is that everyone is happy now.‚Äù¬† Given the way things have worked out, you won‚Äôt hear anyone at Arsenal or Barcelona disagreeing.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-gift-from-heaven-arsenal-mistake-selling/blt3188f363c4047db5,Charles Watts,d12bcf5b-dc47-4927-8cda-0e5d3824ca8f
Arsenal announce Odegaard is their new captain,"Arsenal have announced that Martin Odegaard has been appointed as the club's new captain. The 23-year-old only joined the Gunners in 2021 although has made a big impact during his time in England and Mikel Arteta has decided to reward him with the armband. Former Real Madrid midfielder Odegaard joined Arsenal in January 2021, initially on a loan deal as he struggled for regular football at the Bernabeu. The Norwegian impressed in his first six months as a Gunner and that prompted Arteta to sign him on a permanent ¬£30 million ($41m) deal in the summer of that year. His form dipped at the start of the 2021-22 season, although he improved in the second half of the campaign and became a regular in the starting XI - scoring in the final-day 5-1 win over Everton. ü§≥ A message from our new captain‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs go! üëä pic.twitter.com/Ha48WvTBDc Odegaard also has experience of captaining at international level, with the 23-year-old having been wearing the armband for the Norway national team since March 2021. Before the official announcement, Odegaard had been made captain for matches during the Gunners' pre-season tour of the USA. Arsenal's captain for the 2021-22 season was initially Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, although he was stripped of skipper duties in December 2021 following a breach of club discipline. Alexandre Lacazette then took on the responsibility on a regular basis although his exit to Lyon left Arteta needing to appoint a new captain for the upcoming 2022-23 campaign. The likes of Kieran Tierney, Grant Xhaka and Aaron Ramsdale - who openly admitted he would relish the responsibility of being named Arsenal captain - were all touted as possible candidates, but it's Odegaard that Arteta has turned to. When the new season starts it will, however, not be the first time Odegaard has been named Arsenal captain in a competitive fixture. He wore the armband for Arsenal in their 4-2 win over Chelsea in April 2022, and toldTV2 at the time: ""It's big, of course, but it does not change much. I feel like I'm doing the same things. ""There are more people around who think about it. But it is a great recognition and a great declaration of trust. I take that as a big compliment, but beyond that I do the same as always.""

Laporta again blames Barcelona fans for Eintracht Frankfurt Europa League ticket fiasco,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta has reiterated that the club was not to blame for the ticketing fiasco against Eintracht Frankfurt last week, again taking aim at club members and tour operators instead. The German side were officially allocated 5,000 tickets for the Europa League quarter-final second-leg tie but around 30,000 visiting supporters managed to gain access to the stadium. Buoyed by that extra support Frankfurt turned in a superb display to come away with a 3-2 win that secured a 4-3 aggregate victory, leaving Barca fans furious. Laporta swiftly apologised for the incident, which left Barca boss Xavi complaining that his side had felt ‚Äúrobbed in their own home‚Äù. He also confirmed that tickets for future European ties would be non-transferable in an attempt to prevent fans from selling tickets on to unregistered supporters. That did not do much to curb the anger of some Barcelona supporters, however, with fans group Grada d‚ÄôAnimacio boycotting Monday‚Äôs La Liga game against Cadiz. The group said the events on Thursday marked a ""social humiliation"" and will go down as ""the greatest infamy"" the club has ever suffered at home. Responding to the fresh wave of criticism Laporta again insisted that the club was not to blame, though it would take responsibility in ensuring it does not happen again. ""The club is not to blame for what happened against Eintracht, but it is responsible,"" Laporta told reporters at a news conference. ""We didn't sell tickets to German fans beyond the 5,000 away tickets. Sales from Germany weren't allowed and there were many people trying to buy tickets from there. The system of control worked up to a point, but some organised groups were able to breach the mechanisms in place. ""We inherited the system from the previous board. We thought it could work but we have seen that for special games it doesn't. ""Tickets will now be non-transferrable for non-domestic matches and high-risk games. We are working on other measures so that it does not happen again."" Asked who was to blame for the fiasco, Laporta added: ""A group of members misused their season tickets, which they ceded to German fans.  ""It is sad because we love this club and it is hard to imagine season ticket holders giving their tickets to rival fans. But this happened and it will be subject to analysis. ""There are around 7,000 members that purchased tickets with the discount code and [those tickets] ended up in German hands. We don't want it to become a witch hunt, but there is a lot of disappointment and we will look into possibly taking action. ""We have also detected malpractice from a tour operator, whose contract with the club has now been terminated.‚Äù Laporta added that simply refusing to let the German fans who had tickets enter the stadium was not a solution as it could have sparked flashpoints at the turnstiles. ""I am sure we could have done better,"" he said. ""It concerned us to see so many German fans arriving at the ground, but if we impeded them from entering, we would be talking about more serious incidents.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/laporta-blames-barcelona-fans-eintracht-frankfurt-europa/blt5050c3939853b97c,Tom Mallows,4e1623c4-f611-4b98-a712-5b1d51a20b40

Man Utd targeting Dumfries transfer despite Ten Hag offering Dalot assurances,"Diogo Dalot has been told he will have the chance to establish himself under Erik ten Hag at Manchester United ‚Äì but right back is a position the new manager still wants to address in the transfer market this summer. Inter's Denzel Dumfries is, GOAL has learned, one target under consideration as Ten Hag looks for players who will be able to implement his style at Old Trafford. Questions remain over Aaron Wan-Bisakka‚Äôs future, who fell out of favour under interim manager Ralf Rangnick last season and has struggled to develop as an attacking full-back since signing for United for ¬£50 million ($63m) from Crystal Palace in 2019. Dalot is seen as being able to add to Ten Hag‚Äôs attack in 2022-23 after being favoured by Rangnick in the second half of last season. The Portugal international has been told United have no intention to listen to offers this summer, despite interest from Roma and Atletico Madrid over the past 12 months. An exceptional bid could prompt a change of mind, but the plan is keep Dalot as part of the squad and in contention as first-choice right-back. Work hard, focus on the everyday goals, enjoy the moments with your friends. Great training session with my boy Dalot! Keep fighting!üí™üèΩ pic.twitter.com/EQiibUQPA9 Despite United going a fifth year without silverware and failing to qualify for the Champions League, the last campaign was a successful one for Dalot on a personal level after returning from a loan spell at AC Milan to hold down a regular first-team place. Dumfries is being monitored and has been identified as the type of attacking full-back who would suit Ten Hag‚Äôs system. The 26-year-old Netherlands international is well-known to his countryman after his time at PSV Eindhoven.

Given United famously trawled through a dossier of 804 right-backs before signing Wan-Bissaka, other options are also being explored. Ten Hag wants to make five new signings in his first transfer window at the club, but is prepared to work with a leaner squad. Talks have opened with Barcelona for Frenkie de Jong, who is the club's leading midfield target. United were interested in Darwin Nunez, but pulled out of the race to avoid a bidding war with Liverpool.

Ronaldo admits 'I don‚Äôt have many years left' but Man Utd superstar still plans to play into his 40s,"Cristiano Ronaldo has admitted he does not ‚Äúhave many years left‚Äù, but the Manchester United superstar remains as determined as ever to get his hands on trophies and plans to play into his 40s. The five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner is now 37 years of age and ‚Äì having represented Sporting, Real Madrid, Juventus and the Red Devils ‚Äì is aware the clock is ticking. He has maintained remarkable physical standards, but the legendary Portuguese forward admits the day is approaching when he will have to hang up his boots. Ronaldo, who returned to Old Trafford for a second spell in the Premier League during the summer of 2021, told DAZN : ‚ÄúIt's hard to say that I don't want more, because if I'm at a club that gives me the opportunity to win more things, why not, and in the national team too. ‚ÄúI know I don't have many years left playing, four or five more. We'll see, and I want to win more things.‚Äù Ronaldo already boasts the most enviable of medal collections, but remains eager to pass his vast experience on to those around him for club and country. He added: ‚ÄúYou have to be intelligent and know that at 18, 20 or 25 you are not the same as at 35. That is the maturity, the experience, the intelligence to understand that maybe you lose some things to win others and have balance right to keep competing and be at the highest level. ‚ÄúThat's not easy, but it seems like it to me, because I show year after year that the numbers speak for themselves. ‚ÄúI don't have to tell you that I'm very good, because the numbers are there.

Ronaldinho slams Messi & Neymar's PSG critics: Do you want the worst players in the world instead?,"Ronaldinho has hit out at the boos aimed at Lionel Messi and Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain this season, asking rhetorically if fans would rather have ""the worst players in the world"" as opposed to two of its modern greats. The first reunion campaign between the former Barcelona duo has yielded a Ligue 1 title, but a failure in Europe once more saw supporters turn their ire on the pair of South American internationals. Yet the former attacker - an ex-PSG man himself - feels the reception is unjust, hitting out at the dismissal of superstar talents while saying they need time to settle into a cohesive squad. ""I don't understand because there are all the great players,"" the Brazil legend told RMC Sport. ""You want to change everything? What do you want to have, the worst players in the world? ""We have to wait for them to understand this new way of living and playing football. The rest will come slowly. This adaptation is normal, to do things well. ""[Neymar] is one of the best players in the world. He's had several injuries this year. When he's at 100 per cent, he's a really special player for this team. Neymar, Di Maria, Messi... the greatest players are together. If you're not happy with that, who are you going to play with?"" On Kylian Mbappe, he added: ""He's going to become the best player in the world. The rest is up to him where he's going to play and what he wants to do."" On the matter of Mbappe - who is widely tipped to depart Parc des Princes for Real Madrid this summer - the Brazilian mooted that he would not offer suggestions to the star, instead saying the France star must go for what pleases him most rather than others. ""I have no advice,"" he added. ""I love him very much. The most important thing is that he is happy, the rest will come normally. ""He's going to become the best player in the world.

Torres missing Barcelona kit badge and Nike logo as he rescues draw against Napoli,"Ferran Torres scored a vital goal for Barcelona, but he did so with some notable things missing from his kit. The January signing from Manchester City netted an equalizing goal in Thursday's Europa League draw against Napoli, which ended 1-1, but further inspection shows the Spain international's Barca kit was missing both the club badge and Nike's famous 'swoosh' logo. It is not clear exactly why Torres was playing in a shirt without the key components. Both the traditional marks were on Torres' shirt throughout the first half but did not appear on his shirt in the second, with the club unsure of what happened to the two logos. Their absence prompted plenty of commentary on social media, however, and the unique jersey could well become something of a collector's item in years to come. ¬°Goooooooooool del Barcelona! üî•üòéFerr√°n Torres lo cobra de manera magistral y los cul√©s empatan el partido. ¬°Juegazo en Camp Nou! üëè@fcbarcelona 1-1 @sscnapolies#TuEuropaLeague | #Barcelona | #Napoliüî¥ ¬°EN VIVO!üì∫ TUDN y @unimasüì≤üëâ https://t.co/8L3d8GXas6 pic.twitter.com/fUQFKPiFcK",https://www.goal.com/en/news/torres-score-barca-equaliser-in-shirt-missing-club-badge-and/blt4b412150caf32c33,Ryan Tolmich,eec85186-b8d6-473d-89fa-63a271239c52
Guardiola didn't get the best out of Bayern Munich because he removed their independence - Sammer,"Pep Guardiola didn't get the best out of Bayern Munich because he removed their independence, according to the club's former sporting director Matthias Sammer. Guardiola initially established himself among the coaching elite by delivering multiple La Liga and Champions League titles at Barcelona, whom he left after four years in charge in 2012. The Spaniard then took a 12-month sabbatical before accepting the top job at Bayern Munich, and added 11 more trophies to his CV at Allianz Arena, including three successive Bundesliga crowns. Guardiola helped Bayern re-assert their dominance of German football ahead of Borussia Dortmund, but departed the club in 2016 having ultimately been unable to deliver Champions League success. Sammer, who worked with the current Manchester City manager throughout his tenure at Allianz Arena, feels his meticulous nature prevented the Bayern squad from developing their own personal identity as a collective. ""Guardiola is definitely the most important source of inspiration for football today. His possession of the ball, when it comes to changing positions, he's brilliant,"" the 54-year-old has told German outlet FAZ. ""But in Munich we didn't succeed in activating the last two per cent. ""Pep was always right with his analyses, his measures almost always worked out exactly as planned. But as a result, the team stopped thinking a bit. At the end of this fantastic process he didn't let the team grow so much that they could take the last steps on the way alone."" City have won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup and four League Cups to date under Guardiola. The 51-year-old boasts the highest win percentage in top-flight history, but European glory has remained elusive in Manchester, with a painful final defeat to Chelsea last season marking his latest failure. Sammer thinks Guardiola's struggles in the Champions League post-Barca stem from the fact that he lacks a key component that his predecessors at Bayern had. ""The great secret of leaders like Ottmar Hitzfeld or Jupp Heynckes was that they enabled teams to be independent,"" he said when pressed on what the City boss has been missing.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-didnt-get-best-bayern-munich-because-removed/bltd857f7b1c4f6cd3b,James Westwood,73a2a4f6-e659-41e2-b045-62b0dedd5e6d
Celta Vigo striker Santi Mina handed four-year prison sentence after being found guilty of sexual abuse,"Celta Vigo striker Santi Mina has been sentenced to a four-year prison term and given a ‚Ç¨50,000 fine after he was found guilty of sexual abuse by a court in Almeria. The forward has, however, been acquitted of sexual assault, while former team-mate David Goldar has been further acquitted on all charges of being his accomplice. The pair were on trial for an incident in 2017, when they both played for Valencia, and Mina's lawyers say they will appeal the verdict. Mina, who started his career at Celta before a spell with Valencia between 2015 and 2019, was charged in late 2019 with sexual assault. Legal proceedings have continued since then but it is only now that a verdict has finally been reached, with Mina having continued to play for Celta during the intervening period. Judge Tarsila Martinez has handed down a four-year custodial sentence to the player, as well as a fine and a restraining order of 500 metres. Mina has, however, been acquitted of sexual assault, which would have carried a longer sentence, between eight and nine-and-a-half years. Celta, meanwhile, announced on Wednesday that Mina would be removed from first-team training immediately while they open their own disciplinary investigation into the player. Celta emphasised that his suspension from senior activities was a ""precautionary"" measure following his sentence.

'I want to get more playing time' - USMNT star Pulisic weighs up Chelsea future with eye on World Cup,"Christian Pulisic appears to be weighing up his future at Chelsea, with the United States men's national team star admitting that he wants ""more playing time"" ahead of the 2022 World Cup. The 2021-22 campaign was another frustrating one for Pulisic as he struggled to hold down a regular spot in Thomas Tuchel's starting line-up. The 23-year-old missed the start of the season due to a combination of Covid-19 and a serious ankle injury, and ultimately failed to build up any real momentum after returning to action, leading to question marks over his long-term future with the Blues. Pulisic is under contract at Stamford Bridge until 2024, but is eager to feature on a more regular basis. Speaking ahead of the USMNT's friendly clash with Morroco on Thursday, the winger admitted that his main focus is on making sure that he is fighting fit for the World Cup in Qatar later this year. ""As far as right now, I‚Äôm obviously just focused on what I‚Äôm doing here [with the USMNT]. And I‚Äôm super excited to be here,"" said Pulisic. ""Of course, I want to get more playing time. I want to be on the field as much as I can and be the sharpest I can be and fit as well.

This includes engaging in discussions with possible host cities and stadia to define the optimum tournament model and conducting a full costs and benefits analysis. ‚ÄúThe UK and Ireland will offer an unrivalled tournament from a technical perspective ‚Äì with modern, well-connected stadia and excellent infrastructure ‚Äì that makes our partnership ideal to host Euro 2028.‚Äù The Football Associations of England, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales have today submitted a joint ‚ÄòExpression of Interest‚Äô to host UEFA EURO 2028. Russia and Turkey had also been reportedly interested in hosting the tournament, but any hopes the former may have had of winning the rights were dashed following the country's military invasion of Ukraine. FIFA and UEFA have banned Russia from all international competitions, while a potential bid from Turkey has yet to come in, leaving the UK and Ireland in a strong position to stage the Euros in six years' time. ‚ÄúFootball must do everything possible to show how our sport can be a force for good ‚Äì now, more than ever,"" the FA statement adds. ‚ÄúWe are resolute in our belief in the power of football to help bring people together. ‚ÄúWe now look forward to receiving further tournament requirements and continuing our constructive dialogue with UEFA to advance our bid plans.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uk-and-ireland-submit-bid-to-jointly-host-euro-2028/blt25fedabacfdf0a77,James Westwood,36f467c6-fb6c-44d1-a0a4-dc8e45483e75
Maurits Kjaergaard: The Kaka-inspired teenager shining at Salzburg,"Gone are the days when Red Bull Salzburg could consider themselves an unknown quantity in European football, with the perennial Austrian champions having exploded onto the scene with some swashbuckling performances in the Champions League in recent years. And not only have they been exciting to watch on the big stage, they have also been able to offer their young squad a clear pathway from junior football all the way to Europe‚Äôs top table. Since that final piece was added to the Salzburg puzzle in 2019, Erling Haaland, Hwang Hee-chan, Dominik Szoboszlai and Patson Daka - among others - have moved on and excelled for club and country, with potential suitors queuing up for the current crop of players, such as Karim Adeyemi and Brenden Aaronson. Yet, with so many prodigious talents in the ranks at Salzburg, some exceptional youngsters are bound to be left in the shadows. As the Austrian side‚Äôs best ever Champions League run came to a close with a humbling 7-1 defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich in March, one goalscorer was relegated to the footnotes for most. Slamming home a superb consolation goal that night was 18-year-old Maurits Kjaergaard, who became the second-youngest scorer in the competition this season behind only NXGN 2022 winner Jude Bellingham. It was not just about restoring a touch of pride for his team though, as the goal at the Allianz Arena marked the culmination of a fine few months for the Danish midfielder. Since the turn of the year, Kjaergaard has taken strides towards the Salzburg starting line up, and placed himself head and shoulders above his peers in the hunt to get noticed in Austria. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""The first thing I noticed were his technical abilities,"" Jonathan Hartmann, who coached Kjaergaard at his former club Lyngby, tells GOAL. ""He had a sublime touch on the ball, was quick to turn and run, and had extraordinary vision for the decisive passes to find his team-mates‚Äô runs. ""I remember the first time he trained with the first team. He was 15 then, and in the very first drill he pulled off an insane nutmeg of a much more senior player in the team, and everyone just went crazy. ""You could see the raw talent that he had, despite being that much younger.‚Äù Having joined Salzburg from Lyngby in 2019 after the Austrian side paid ‚Ç¨2.6 million (¬£2.3m/$2.9m) to secure the signing, Kjaergaard began exhibiting those technical traits, scoring seven goals and laying on 14 assists for Salzburg's second-tier feeder team, FC Liefering. That helped him earn the trust of Salzburg coach Matthias Jaissle, and his breakthrough into the first team has led to results at Bundesliga level too, with Kjaergaard‚Äôs blonde locks and confident strides catching the eye on his bursting runs into opposition territory, leading to eight direct goal involvements in his first 20 senior games. ‚ÄúPlaying at Liefering is a really good concept,"" Kjaergaard tells GOAL. ""At such a young age, you can play against men in a professional league week-in, week-out, it‚Äôs perfect. ""I‚Äôm a fast player with good technique and vision. I looked up to Kaka, the way he played was inspirational to me, the way he controlled the ball. He didn‚Äôt have that many tricks, but he ran with speed and vision, and combined that with his shooting. I really enjoyed the way he played.‚Äù Kjaergaard already has a touch of Kaka‚Äôs style to his own game, and shades of a young Kevin De Bruyne are beginning to show themselves too, as he drags players out wide and opens up opportunities for forwards in other areas. He possesses a gliding dribbling style that is both easy on the eye, and can leave opponents flat-footed as he strides by them. As the best players show, though, it is one thing to go past someone at full pace, but it is another to have the composure to pick out the right pass afterwards, something which Kjaergaard‚Äôs solid assist figures demonstrate. Technique alone does not equal success of course, but Hartmann has belief in his former pupil. ‚ÄúHe always had an outstanding work ethic,"" he says. ""I see him as a naturally gifted player, but also as a very intelligent young man - the latter being even more important. ""His move to Red Bull Salzburg was proof of his intelligence. I‚Äôm sure he could have gone to a more famous club, but he saw them as the perfect place to grow as a player.‚Äù That Kjaergaard has developed at Salzburg is unquestionable. His rise from Lyngby‚Äôs youth team to the Champions League scoresheet has taken place in less than three seasons. In 2021, Salzburg tied him down to a new contract lasting until the summer of 2024, but that has not prevented interest from Serie A, primarily from Juventus and Bologna if recent rumours are to be believed. For now though, it looks like Kjaergaard is happy with his lot in Salzburg. ‚ÄúI felt great moving here. I was thinking about my development,"" he explains. ""The things that I needed to learn were the things that Salzburg had in focus in their playing style; winning 50/50 duels against the ball, making high speed runs at the opponents, pressing, just getting used to this high tempo every day and trying to get better step by step. ""Salzburg‚Äôs strengths were my weaknesses. If I can learn them, I‚Äôll be a better player.‚Äù Mauritis Kjaergaard puts GOAL #4 on the board for #Salzburg.Watch the finish of this one LIVE: https://t.co/zoE5BggQ3Z pic.twitter.com/Ka38vtCobD Given the club‚Äôs track record of cultivating young players with a steep development curve, Salzburg seems like the perfect place for a teenager like Kjaergaard to stick around a while longer. ‚ÄòWhen I started playing I was just having fun,"" he concludes. ""I still have fun now. My team-mates here have special gifts and I just enjoy watching them every day. I‚Äôll keep doing my best, having fun, and we‚Äôll see what happens.‚Äù If the time does come for Kjaergaard to move on, his combination of technique, willingness to improve, and all-round positivity mean that you would back the young Dane to settle in well somewhere else. And with a gleaming shop window like the one that Salzburg offer their young stars, there should be no shortage of destinations on offer for Kjaergaard in the future.

Mourinho apologises after his Roma assistant tells opponent they're going to be relegated,"Roma coach Jose Mourinho has apologised to Salernitana after one of his assistants mocked the team. Roma beat Salernitana 2-1 on Sunday, leaving the visitors rooted to the bottom of Serie A. Salernitana have taken just 16 points from their 30 matches in the league and are nine from safety with just eight games left to play. Mourinho admitted after the match that a member of his staff told a member of the opposition that they would soon be relegated, with the coach taking the opportunity to have a dig at Bodo/Glimt, who his club feuded with in the Europa Conference League. ‚ÄúI tell the truth, not like some clubs or the police. Someone on my bench told the Salernitana staff they were going to Serie B. I went to apologise for the lad who said that,"" Mourinho said at a press conference. ‚ÄúWe are civilised people, what happens on the field ends there. Nobody will be waiting outside 45 minutes later to punch someone in the face."" A fracas on the touchline during the Serie A encounter ended with Salernitana coach Davide Nicola trying to get to Roma assistant Salvatore Foti. It's only the latest controversy Roma have been involved in this week. After their 2-1 win in their Europa Conference League match against Bodo/Glimt, captain Lorenzo Pellegrini said that the Norwegian team's coach, Kjetil Knutsen, attacked Roma's goalkeeping coach Nuno Gomes. He said after the match: ‚ÄúSomething truly unpleasant just happened. The changing rooms are opposite and Knutsen began to say something to our coach and then attacked.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-apologises-after-his-roma-assistant-tells-opponent-they-/blt66db0bf11f881401,By Peter McVitie,52920fd5-45cd-4b42-8163-05ceaaba7e62
Ex-Newcastle United & Nigeria‚Äôs Ameobi opens up on ‚Äòmurky‚Äô Ashley years and future hope,"Retired Nigerian striker Shola Ameobi has explained why it would have been frustrating for him to play for Newcastle United in the last few years. The Premier League club underwent a change in ownership when Mike Ashley left and the club transitioned to Amanda Staveley, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, Jamie Reuben, and the Public Investment Fund having control of the club. The Nigerian left the Magpies in 2014, having played for them for 14 years, seven of which were under Ashley's ownership. ""It was very murky,"" Ameobi said of the latter years under Ashley. ""[But now] to have owners who want to have a clear vision, doing the due diligence as we speak on where the club is, and who want to set a benchmark against other top Premier League clubs, that is where they want to be, where the fans want to be, and me, as a fan as well, it‚Äôs really exciting - I am hopeful for the future."" Currently, the 40-year-old is acting as the side‚Äôs loan manager and oversees those who leave the club temporarily and track their development.  The former Super Eagles star hopes to have a positive influence on the club in the capacity he is serving at. ""Regardless, if I worked for the club, I used to coach the academy in the evening, I always wanted to be involved - it‚Äôs my heart. This role didn‚Äôt exist when I stopped,"" continued Ameobi. ""It was quite a fluid thing that just happened, and it gives me an opportunity to work not only with the academy but with the first team players, recruitment, and all the different departments. Hopefully, I can be a positive influence on the club, helping out where I can. ""Newcastle‚Äôs in my blood. I always want to help the next generation. I always look back on the help that I got growing up, and I feel I have a sense of duty to do the same. Obviously, being in the role that I am, helping the next group of players hopefully transition into first-team football is key."" Eddie Howe‚Äôs side now lies nine points off the drop zone, and Ameobi says hope is what brings a distinct difference between the past and now. ""There‚Äôs hope. That‚Äôs ultimately something I don‚Äôt think is talked about enough,"" he discussed. ""I know over the past few years there‚Äôs been a distinct lack of that in the club. There‚Äôs a chance now, with the new owners and what they want to do going forward, it just gives everyone a sense of 'we want to build something that is great'.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-newcastle-united-nigeria-ameobi-opens-up-on-murky-ashley/blt4042eb21cfffd7fd,Kiplagat Sang,fee1f505-25ee-4dc9-913f-ab56dcc08d92
Chelsea first team led by Mount buy tickets for academy players to watch FA Cup final after sanctions,"Chelsea's first team players and coaching staff have paid and organised for all their academy youngsters to get tickets to attend the FA Cup final at Wembley.¬† Usually this would be organised by the club, but the ability to purchase tickets was taken away due to the current sanctions imposed on them by the UK Government.¬† Mason Mount is thought to have played a key role, along with several other youth team graduates in the squad, to organise tickets for academy director Neil Bath to give out.¬† Shortly after the story came out, Tuchel went on the record to confirm that they bought the tickets for their youth players. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we did. It‚Äôs a big competition. It is one club. Normally the club would buy these tickets to provide it for the players‚Äô parents of the academy so we stepped in and bought the tickets for them,‚Äù he said in a press conference at Cobham Training Centre. The Blues are limited with what they can purchase through the Government's newly proposed Russia regulations which seek to clamp down on oligarch wealth in the country.¬† It saw Roman Abramovich targeted, among several other billionaires, in sanctions that effectively froze all their assets.¬† It risked ending Chelsea's season and plunging them into a crisis but a special operating licence has been given.¬† Although the Blues can still spend some money to keep the club running close to normal, it has meant the club shop has remained closed and that new tickets can't be sold at Stamford Bridge for home games, leaving a proportion of the seats empty.¬† There have been several small problems along the way, including this academy issue, but the first team and Thomas Tuchel's staff have been generous when needed.¬† The Clearlake Capital takeover led by Todd Boehly is expected to go through in the next few days with the Premier League soon to complete its due diligence.¬† After that, the transfer of funds and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will work to resolve issues around where they go with Abramovich asking for the entire sum to be donated to charity.¬† Abramovich has said he is willing to write off his entire ¬£1.5 billion ($1.8 bn) loan, which Chelsea owes to his parent company Fordstam, and donate the entire sum to a charity related to the war in Ukraine after Russia's invasion.¬† However, there are thought to be some complexities needing resolving around the loan, which is currently frozen like all his other assets in the UK.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-mount-buy-tickets-academy-players-fa-cup-final/blta9d6eb8e804d2d4f,Nizaar Kinsella,4daaf3c7-1bac-4862-9887-292d9ae4d64a
Chelsea vs Arsenal & Liverpool vs Man Utd dates confirmed as Premier League announces fixture amendments for April,"The Premier League has announced a series of fixture amendments for matches in April, including several key games featuring top clubs. Chelsea's clash with Arsenal and Liverpool's battle with Manchester United are among the games impacted, with seven matches moved to accommodate live TV coverage and to accommodate rescheduled dates. Some matches could still be altered depending on FA Cup and Champions League schedules, with several clubs still involved in both competitions. Liverpool's clash with Manchester United at Anfield has been moved to April 19, while Chelsea's match against Arsenal will take place the following evening while being broadcast on Sky Sports.

The Merseyside derby, meanwhile, is set for April 24, although that could change if Liverpool reach the Champions League semi-finals. However, the Premier League has yet to announce a rescheduled date for the north London derby, which was postponed in January due to a series of positive Covid-19 tests in the Arsenal squad.

"Egypt vs Senegal: Kick-off, TV channel, squad news and preview","Egypt will be seeking redemption when they square off with Senegal in the 2022 Fifa World Cup Qualification¬†Third Round match on Friday. With the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final defeat to Senegal still fresh in their minds, the Pharaohs will be desperate¬†to avenge the loss and also take control¬†of the tie before heading to Dakar for the second-leg clash on Tuesday. Coach Carlos Queiroz, who guided his native Portugal¬†and Iran to the World Cup finals in the past, is under pressure to ensure that Egypt overcome the Lions of Teranga on aggregate and secure their second successive qualification for the global showpiece. The seven-time African champions will be up against a Senegal side that will be banking on the psychological edge that they hold over their opponents having defeated¬†them 4-2 penalties following a 0-0 draw in the Afcon final in Yaounde just last month. The Lions of Teranga also took part in the last World Cup finals four years ago in Russia and coach Aliou Cisse will be looking to ensure that his side avoids emulating Egypt, Ivory Coast and Zambia, who all failed to qualify for football's most prestigious tournament while being reigning African champions. Egypt will be without several players who are out injured including Mohamed Hany, Ramadan Sobhi, while¬†Ahmed Hegazi and Akram Tawfik are also still out nursing injuries which they picked up during the 2021 Afcon finals.  However, the Pharaohs have been boosted by the availability of their captain and star forward Mohamed Salah. The Liverpool superstar has recovered from an injury that saw him miss the Reds' FA Cup clash with Nottingham¬†Forest last weekend.  Considered by some as the best goalkeeper based in Africa, Mohamed El Shenawy is expected to start in goal after missing the recent clash against Senegal due to injury. El Shenawy and Salah could be key to Egypt defeating the Lions of Teranga.  Meanwhile, Senegal have not reported any injuries in their camp ahead of this highly-anticipated encounter with Cisse having named a squad made up mostly of players who were part of his Afcon title-winning squad. Cisse could also unleash Ismaila Sarr, who has recovered from an injury that led to the flying winger missing Watford's last three matches. Sarr also missed Senegal's group stage matches in Cameroon due to injury, but he started against Egypt in the final. The West African side will once again pin their hopes of overcoming the Pharaohs on Salah's club teammate Sadio Mane. The world-class attacker missed a penalty in regulation time against Egypt, but he converted the spot-kick which earned Senegal the win during the penalty shootout. In a Head-to-Head record, Egypt and Senegal have met 13 times.  The Pharaohs have the upper hand having recorded six wins compared to the Lions of Teranga's five victories while two matches ended in a draw.  Their 2021 Afcon final encounter remains the last game between Egypt and Senegal. The two teams reached this round of the 2022 World Cup qualification following successful group stage campaigns as Egypt won Group F without losing a single match.  While Senegal were dominant in Group H - winning five of their six games, with one match  ending in a draw as they finished at the top of the standings.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/egypt-vs-senegal-kick-off-tv-channel-squad-news-and-preview/blt59a646b123b92189,Austin  Ditlhobolo,64efa5ec-2981-4310-b756-b011918314cf
What do Europa League winners get? Prize money & Champions League qualification explained,"UEFA have been working hard to get as many teams as possible competing in continental competition, with the Europa League one of the grandest prizes on offer despite often finding itself operating in the shadow of the more illustrious Champions League. Rubbing shoulders with the elite is the ultimate goal for all of those involved in European football, but any opportunity to land major silverware should never be passed up and can be expected to conjure up dreams of savouring ultimate glory for those fortunate enough to reach the latter stages. Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt have made their way to the final in 2021-22, with their contest set to play out at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium in Seville on May 18, but what will the victors receive alongside a shiny trophy? GOAL takes a look... Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt are both guaranteed to pocket ¬£4.2 million ($5.2m) just for reaching the final. The added incentive for emerging victorious is that the winners on Spanish soil will collect a further ¬£3.6m ($4.53m), meaning that they will almost double their overall earnings. That is because the team hoisting a famous trophy aloft in the middle of May will go on to face the Champions League winners ‚Äì either Liverpool or Real Madrid ‚Äì in the UEFA Super Cup on August 10. Full breakdown of Europa League 2021-22 prize money: Stage of competition Prize money Winner ¬£7.8m Runner-up ¬£4.2m Semi-finalist ¬£2.5m Quarter-finalist ¬£1.6m Round of 16 ¬£1.1m Knockout round play-offs ¬£446,000 Group winner ¬£994,000 Group runner-up ¬£500,000 Group stage win ¬£572,000 Group stage draw ¬£191,000 Group stage qualification ¬£3.3m Alongside the obvious benefits of adding another piece of silverware to trophy cabinets in Glasgow or Frankfurt, while also boosting respective bank balances, there is another major perk to winning the Europa League. Rangers and Eintracht know that success at the home of La Liga outfit Sevilla will send them straight through to the group stage of the 2022-23 Champions League. Giovanni van Bronckhorst‚Äôs side will be hoping to tread that path regardless of what happens in their next outing, with a runners-up spot in the Scottish Premiership this season guaranteeing them a place in the third qualifying round of next season‚Äôs Champions League. Eintracht, though, could only muster an 11th-place finish in the Bundesliga this term and find themselves in all or nothing territory ahead of a meeting with the Gers. Defeat for Oliver Glasner‚Äôs side would leave them without European football of any kind for 2022-23, while victory will catapult them into Champions League and Super Cup showpieces.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-do-europa-league-winners-get-prize-money-champions/blt7270b787b6a71218,Chris Burton,6c8f2b92-c664-48e2-bfc2-298458c25934
It's mind blowing that mental training isn't mandatory - Juventus goalkeeper Szczesny,"Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny believes mental training should be mandatory for football players and that it is ""mind blowing"" that it is not widespread in the game. Many clubs have invested in hiring psychologists to help players with their mental state in recent years. But Szczesny feels that clubs continue to underestimate the importance of mental health and that they should focus on it more. Mental health has been an increasingly common topic of conversation in football as players open up on their issues. Arda Turan, Paul Pogba and Christian Pulisic have been among those to speak about it. ""For me, it's mind blowing that in 2022, professional clubs don't have mandatory mental training for players,"" he said to Kanal Sportowy. ""This is sick, do an interview with any football player and he will tell you that like 70 percent of performance is in your head. And 100% of mandatory training is physical.  ""There are psychologists in clubs and player can use their services if they want to, but there is no mandatory mental training. And should be especially in situations when all is well.  ""You shouldn't go to a psychologist only when things are already bad. When you are looking for knowledge about your head only when your mental is broken, it's harder to obtain that knowledge when your situation is already bad."" The Poland international has admitted that he feels physical pain with every save he makes ever since he broke his arms. ""Breaking my arms at gym as teenager costs me to this day,"" he added.  ""Every save is painful for me. I don't talk about it too much because I get used to it, but you need to be an idiot to work in a profession when every save - and I make hundreds of saves daily - brings you authentic pain.  ""There are maybe solutions for this. If I would remove metal plates from my arms, it could help but recovery would take few months and I didn't have opportunity like another injury to take care of this.  ""I found a solution with my gloves that helps a little but before 2018, I have situations when pain was so big that after training I couldn't take off my gloves or open a bottle of water.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mental-training-isn-t-mandatory-juventus-goalkeeper-szczesny/bltc742365308144938,Peter McVitie,fc89fb67-c4d9-40bd-889c-6ca1f72b26a1
Simba SC‚Äôs ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô was ploy to try get into minds of Orlando Pirates' players ‚Äì Kerr,"Dylan Kerr has revealed Simba SC‚Äôs ‚Äúrituals"" during their Caf Confederation Cup game against Orlando Pirates was to try and get into the minds of the players ahead of kick-off. There were ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô claims that surrounded the quarter-final return leg fixture at Orlando Stadium after Simba players took to the centre of the pitch and pretended to be praying before smoke was seen billowing from the legs of the players. The scene attracted Pirates officials, who after Simba had done their part, used water to spray the ground before kick-off. However, it was Pirates who went ahead to emerge 4-3 winners on penalties, after a 1-1 draw in normal and added time, to qualify for the semi-finals. Kerr, who handled Simba in 2015, has confessed exclusively to GOAL it is Simba‚Äôs culture to do such rituals, though he did not get involved with the same during his one-year stint with the Tanzania Mainland Premier League champions.  ‚Äú‚ÄôJuju‚Äô it‚Äôs their culture,‚Äù the 55-year-old British tactician, who currently handles Moroka Swallows in PSL responded to GOAL when asked about the incident at Orlando Stadium. ‚ÄúI saw the video and obviously it doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs a ploy to try and get into the minds of the players and fans.‚Äù Asked whether he has previously been involved in ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô while coaching in Africa, Kerr said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done many ‚ÄòJuju rituals especially, at Black Leopards of South Africa but I never did it with Simba. ‚ÄúLike at Black Leopards, we used to bathe in some stuff, get washed, blessed, and walk over smoke before every match.‚Äù Asked if the ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô ever worked in his team‚Äôs favour, Kerr said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it does but they believe in it. We pray we sing beautiful songs they have rituals so you have to join in that ritual but many players don‚Äôt and that‚Äôs got to have an effect on the game some do some don‚Äôt so if you are not altogether in it how can you believe it will work? Kerr continued: ‚ÄúI remember a massive game and the club Black [Leopards] wanted us to go into the mountain the night before a game for four hours round trip to get ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô, I refused to go so the technical team went and got it and brought it to camp.‚Äù  The former Gor Mahia coach also remembered doing the ‚Äúrituals‚Äù with Nathi Lions FC also of South Africa. ‚ÄúAt Nathi, it was a funny story, we were running down the beach and I was so far in front I turned around and saw players standing so I asked why they were not running,‚Äù Kerr remembered. ‚ÄúThere were chicks buried in the sand their butts and feet sticking up in the air, heads buried and they would not cross that line.‚Äù He also remembers when a team in the FKF Premier League did ‚Äúrituals‚Äù before facing Gor Mahia: ‚ÄúWhen I was in Gor Mahia, we were playing a team, I can‚Äôt remember which team, and they had a ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô man and we saw they had slaughtered a goat, and they had a mixed bag of things. ‚ÄúThey sacrificed or killed something and they paid a lot of money for the ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô man to give them luck. ‚ÄúAnyway it was not the case because we beat them 5-0 and after the final whistle, they chased the ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô man down and they got the money back because they did not believe the ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô worked or it was not good ‚ÄòJuju‚Äô.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/simba-sc-s-juju-was-ploy-to-try-get-into-minds-of-orlando/blt31f784883f7350ab,Dennis Mabuka,3787dd4a-aeea-4c3a-a59a-3231f3a6c25a
Charlotte FC set MLS attendance record in first home game against LA Galaxy,"MLS newcomers Charlotte FC broke the league's attendance record on Saturday night as they played their first-ever home match against the LA Galaxy. The previous record had been set by Atlanta United, who held the regular-season mark of 72,548 and the postseason record of 73,019.

"Messi financial boost to PSG revealed: Shirt sales, sponsorship and social media breakdown","PSG snapped Messi up on a free transfer following his departure from Barcelona in the summer, tying the Argentine down to a two-season deal with the option of an extra year. The capture of the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner was perceived by many to be the biggest coup of the last transfer window, but what effect has he had on PSG's revenue stream so far?  GOAL is here with everything you need to know. PSG have sold almost one million Messi-printed jerseys to date in 2022-21, GOAL can confirm. The club's sponsorship director Marc Armstrong says the 34-year-old's arrival led to record-breaking overall shirt sales for the year and believes they would have been even higher had it not been for the manufacturing delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""He's a great asset. From a commercial point of view, the impact is incredible,"" Armstrong told GOAL. ‚ÄúWe believe that last year we sold more shirts than any other club, and this year will be even better.¬†It's definitely the best jersey launch in terms of sales with at least a 30-40% increase in demand. ""The demand has been enormous.¬†If we could produce more, we would sell even more."" Armstrong also revealed sponsorship offers began flooding in for PSG as soon as Messi's departure from Barca was confirmed. The French giants moved quickly to win the race for the Argentine international's signature and are now reaping the rewards as external companies also seek to profit on his popularity.  Partnerships have been agreed with brands such as Autohero, Crypto.com, Smart Good Things and Gorillas as PSG have been able to rake in millions in additional revenue. ‚ÄúThere has been an impact and the partners are committed to our price.¬†Previously, demand was already strong, but now it is greater than ever,"" Armstrong added. ""We immediately had a significant increase in offers and even before he officially signed in Paris, there were a lot of requests. ""We have really felt an impact in all of our business areas: from sponsorship and merchandising to hospitality and ticketing."" Has PSG's social media following increased? PSG's online presence has grown exponentially with Messi on their books, with 20 million subscribers gained across all of their social media platforms in the first week after his signing alone. GOAL understands that number has increased by one million every month since, and Armstrong says another club record fell on the day he was officially confirmed as a PSG player. ""Our community is at an all-time high, with 150 million social media fans,"" he said. ""We had the highest engagement rate in the history of player announcements, all club and player¬†accounts¬†combined."" Messi, who has recorded six goals and five assists in his first 15 appearances for PSG, has also had a positive effect on the club's ticket sales. Armstrong admits that the club are struggling to keep up with demand as they continue to sell out every fixture well in advance, with price hikes now inevitable in the hospitality sector. However, PSG's sponsorship chief has promised that normal tickets will remain affordable for the general public regardless of how much registration levels increase. ‚ÄúThere is a huge demand that we, unfortunately, cannot fully meet at the moment, so interest in the secondary market is growing as you would expect,‚Äù said Armstrong. ""This is one of the many elements that we will be considering in the pricing strategy and in all of our ongoing renewal discussions. It would not be surprising if prices go up.¬† ""This is a point on which we are working.¬†In the general public areas of the stadium, we are nevertheless committed to keeping prices affordable to allow all our fans to enjoy the Paris Saint-Germain experience.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-psg-shirt-sales-sponsorship-social-media/blt58386af5f29fed5b,Marc Mechenoua,b3138a1b-aa39-47c0-93e5-e75d7dcaa25f

One appearance in four seasons - ¬£35m flop Drinkwater rues wasting best years at Chelsea,"Former Chelsea midfielder Danny Drinkwater admits he feels like he has wasted the best years of his career during his time with the Blues, after his torrid five-season spell - including just one game in his last four campaigns - came to an end. The 33-year-old departed Stamford Bridge last month upon the expiry of the contract he signed when he made a ¬£35 million ($42m) transfer from Leicester City in 2017, one year after helping to fire the Foxes to a remarkable Premier League title triumph. But while other stars who departed the King Power Stadium thrived in new environments, such as N'Golo Kante and Riyad Mahrez, Drinkwater saw his dreams crumble following an injury-affected maiden season, with a cycle of disappointing loan spells and few appearances, leaving him to rue his time at the club. ""I'm relieved, because it's clear it wasn't a situation that was good for me or the club,"" Drinkwater told Sky Sports News on his departure. ""I'm angry because of how it's gone and how I was treated - not bitter though, what ifs. It was a long time coming."" ""It feels like 'what have you thrown those five years away?' [for]. If you'd stayed at Leicester, if you didn't get injured and if the club treated you differently. They're all ifs. It's frustrating, 100 per cent. Don't think I'm still not burning about how it's gone. I still kick myself for it. ""But on the other side, am I going to keep kicking myself, because I can't change it? That's why I went on loan, why I went to Aston Villa and Burnley on loan, which didn't work, and going to Turkey at the age of 30 - I never thought I'd do that. I've been trying to do the right things."" Following a successful loan stint in the Championship with Reading last term, the former England international has indicated that he is not ready to hang up his boots yet, and that he is considering options as he prepares for another campaign. ""There are a few offers flying about,"" he said. ""It's a weird time for football, especially when you're free to the market. ""That last season helped me massively, getting all those games under my belt, and hopefully the second half of the season showed I've still got the ability and hunger to push myself. There are options, it's just about the decision. I love winning, so it's a difficult thing to let go at this age.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/35m-flop-drinkwater-rues-wasting-best-years-at-chelsea/bltef706fa1cfaacc3f,Andrew Steel,dae103da-9121-47f0-ba6a-cec770884e39

By GOAL's Chelsea Correspondent, Nizaar Kinsella The stand-out news from Chelsea's fixture list reveal is that they start away at Everton in a fixture that they have lost on four successive occasions - their longest such run in the Premier League. Following that up with games against Tottenham at home, Leeds away, Leicester at home means they have a pretty difficult start to 2022-23 The biggest quirk of the fixtures is that the Blues play all of their fellow 'Big Six' teams at home in the first half of the campaign, and then away in the second half. That truly comes into focus during the run-in, with trips to Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all slated for the final six weeks of the season. There are reasons to be cheerful, though. They generally have favourable fixtures within London immediately after their Champions League group matches, while games against newly-promoted Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest mean they have avoided a tough restart following the World Cup break.

"New York City FC vs Inter Miami: Predictions, tips & betting odds","New York City FC welcome Inter Miami to the Yankee Satdium in the early hours of Sunday evening with the hosts aiming to continue their excellent MLS form. Neil Cushing's men have lost just one of their last 15 league games and a win this weekend could see them move to the top of the Eastern Conference. Miami meanwhile were beaten 6-0 by Barcelona in a midweek friendly while their away form in the league has been poor with Phil Neville's side winless in their last six road game. NYCFC have won all four league matches they have faced against Inter Miami and the hosts are clear favourites to keep that winning run going with bet365 offering them at just 2/5 (1.40). The visitors for their part have won just one of their nine away matches this term with that solitary victory coming back in April and are offered at 6/1 (7.00) with the draw at 15/4 (4.75). MLS' top scorer is Taty Castellanos with the Argentine already netting 13 times. Only five of those goals have been the opening strikes of the game, yet he remains the favourite to break the deadlock at 5/2 (3.50) just ahead of teammate Heber at 4/1 (5.00). For the visitors, Leonardo Campana is offered at 9/1 (10.00) with Gonzalo Higuain at 10/1 (11.00). NYCFC boast the second-best defensive record in MLS this season having conceded just 21 goals in 20 games. The Sky Blues have kept clean sheets in half of their league games this term, including in each of their last two matches. Miami meanwhile have failed to score in five of their last six matches on the road and have only netted in two of their four games against New York City FC. Backing the hosts to keep another clean sheet makes plenty of sense given their excellent defensive record, as well as the visitors woes in the final third. The home team can be backed at 6/5 (2.20) to keep a clean sheet while combining this selection with a victory for New York sees the odds climb marginally to 11/8 (2.38).

"Essien and Muntari: In Afena-Gyan, is Portuguese craftsman Mourinho developing another Ghanaian weapon?","Michael Essien‚Ä¶ Sulley Muntari... Jose Mourinho has a fine history with developing Ghanaian players and with new sensation Felix Afena-Gyan, the former Chelsea and Inter Milan manager may be on the cusp of crafting his latest piece of work.  Upon joining Chelsea in 2004 after winning the Champions League with Porto, Mourinho was quick to identify Essien as one of his top priorities for his new adventure at Stamford Bridge. At the time, the midfielder was lighting up the French Ligue 1 with Lyon, having won the league title in 2004 and 2005 and the Super Cup in 2003 and 2004. But still, ‚ÄòThe Bull‚Äô was far from a household name in world football.  In August 2005, Lyon and Chelsea agreed on a ¬£24.4 million fee after a long-running transfer saga, making the then 22-year-old Ghanaian Chelsea‚Äôs most expensive signing of all time. His acquisition unarguably remains one of The Blues‚Äô best football business as he would go on to win two Premier League titles, four FA Cup honours, one Football League Cup, one Community Shield and a Champions League gold, with three of the titles (2005-06 Premier League, 2006-07 FA Cup, 2006-07 League Cup) coming under Mourinho‚Äôs tutelage before he left the Blues‚Äô dugout in 2007. Again, after his appointment as Inter Milan boss in 2007, Mourinho snapped up Muntari, who had just helped Portsmouth win the FA Cup. It would be another beautiful run for a Ghanaian under the Portuguese coach, as they won two Serie A titles, one League Cup, one Super Cup, and the 2009-10 Champions League title.  Fast-forward more than a decade and there seems to be another beautiful piece of the story blooming, albeit with a slightly different starting plot. In May last year, Mourinho took up the job as Roma manager, only a month after the Italian side announced the signing of Afena-Gyan following an impressive trial stint. Having left Ghana only a few months prior, the striker was expected to take a good amount of time to get used to his new environment and was, thus, shipped to the club‚Äôs youth side.  However, it was not the start envisaged which played out, as the forward hit the ground running with goals for Roma in the youth league. Having been knocking hard on the door of the first team, it was unsurprising that Afena-Gyan was soon promoted to the senior team.  In October, the youngster was handed a Serie A debut by Mourinho against Cagliari. A month later, he went on to announce his arrival on the big stage in grand style, scoring a sensational double as a substitute to ensure a 2-0 triumph over Genoa.  There was even more to come for the now 19-year-old, as he helped Ghana to secure qualification for the 2022 World Cup, leading the lines in matches as big as play-off clashes with none other than arch-rivals Nigeria in March.  It could even get better for the teenager as he could end his first season of senior football with a big medal, with Roma having qualified for the final of the Uefa Europa Conference League.  From playing school football back home, to gracing Serie A, representing Ghana and now being all but confirmed for the World Cup in Qatar later this year, it has been a phenomenal transformation for the attacker in a matter of months. In all these, Mourinho, who believed in the Ghanaian, handed him opportunities so early and gave him the confidence to thrive, probably deserves credit more than any other.  Even then, Afena-Gyan, who has had limited opportunities at Stadio Olimpico, is far from a finished product. ‚ÄúHe [Afena-Gyan] is a long, long way from being the finished product - a long way from being a complete player and a long way from being the perfect player to start for a team like Roma. But he is a player that deserves to be worked with and deserves a chance to play,‚Äù Mourinho said about the Black Star in March.  He may be nowhere in the class of Essien and Muntari just yet, but Afena-Gyan‚Äôs promising Roma start signals a new Ghanaian weapon may just be under development under craftsman Mourinho.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/essien-muntari-portugul-mourinho-afena-gyan-ghanai-weapon/blt2c38e9df7eb6520c,Prince  Narkortu Teye,33e85581-ba3a-4d81-a2af-7377189fd69d
Afcon 2021: ‚ÄòSadio is doing well‚Äô ‚Äì Senegal provide Mane update after injury scare,"Senegal have confirmed forward Sadio Mane is ‚Äúdoing well‚Äù following his injury scare during the team‚Äôs Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 fixture against Cape Verde on Tuesday. The 29-year-old suffered a clash of heads with the Blue Sharks‚Äô goalkeeper Vozinha as they tussled for a high ball, and the Liverpool star appeared to be unconscious after going down. While the Cape Verde keeper was shown a straight red card after receiving treatment from the incident, Mane stayed on the pitch and opened the scoring for the Lions of Teranga in the 63rd minute with a beautifully curled effort. However, he could not finish the game as he went down to the ground a few minutes later, while holding his head, and was substituted. Senegal then went on to win the game 2-0 after Bamba Dieng, who came on for Mane, scored deep into stoppage time to secure a quarter-final berth. Ahead of the team‚Äôs last-eight fixture against Equatorial Guinea on Sunday, Senegal have posted on their social media page the progress being made by Mane. ‚ÄúSadio is doing well,‚Äù Senegal posted with pictures of smiling Mane, in the gym while giving thumbs up to the camera. Mane, who has so far scored two goals in the 33rd edition of the competition in Cameroon, has also taken to his social media page to give further updates on his fitness. ‚ÄúRecovering,‚Äù Mane wrote on his Instagram page accompanied with an emoji of love. Meanwhile, former Liverpool midfielder Salif Diao is confident Mane will be involved when Senegal come up against Equatorial Guinea on Sunday. ‚ÄúI spoke to him yesterday, just after he left the hospital, and he said everything was clear,‚Äù Diao told Sky Sports.  ‚ÄúFrom what I understood he has been cleared by the doctors and should be OK.‚Äù Caf medical doctor Thulani Ngwenya has also assured Liverpool not to worry about the health of the forward, insisting they have a medical team capable of helping the player. ‚ÄúWe have a very capable medical team. Senegal have two team doctors, who are highly commended,‚Äù Ngwenya said as quoted by Sky Sports. ‚ÄúI know the team doctors are responsible, so they communicate with the club and I understand that they have actually communicated with Liverpool and they have been told what is actually happening. ‚ÄúWhat I know, is that after taking Mane for further investigations, we scanned the head and there was no structural damage, but that does not rule out a concussion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident that my colleagues are taking care of the player and the player was in good spirits when I saw him in the hospital. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure whether he will be available for the next match because when you look at the protocols I don‚Äôt whether he will be ready and I can't make that assessment.

Becali told Pro X: ""You're going to laugh, but I might be right. Those vaccinated lose their strength. That's something scientific. All vaccinated people lose their strength!

WATCH: Ten Hag unimpressed with Manchester United squad as he attempts to implement new philosophy,"Erik ten Hag is a man on a mission at Manchester United. The Dutch manager wants a complete overhaul at Old Trafford to get the United juggernaut running after a trophy-less 2021-22 campaign.  He knows the task is daunting and his predecessors in David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have had a tough time bringing back the glory days. Ten Hag has already started his training sessions with the Man Utd squad and is set to fly to Thailand on Friday for pre-season commitments - but the former Ajax manager was unimpressed with his troops during a training session at Carrington.  During a drill, the Red Devils were seen practising one-touch passing with their right foot. However, a few players, including Bruno Fernandes, failed to pass to the right foot. Assistant coach Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag were screaming instructions to the players to execute the routine correctly.  ""On the right foot. Bruno on the right foot!"" Erik ten Hag in training: ""Making too many mistakes..""Notice how he's been taking them on one-touch, quick-passing football?Reminds me when he said ""good is not good enough.

Leicester City release 2022-23 home shirt inspired by iconic club moments,"Adidas has taken a trip down memory lane to Leicester City's most iconic moments to design a shirt that celebrates the club's 'Create Iconic' campaign. This includes perhaps the most significant moment in the club's history when the Foxes clinched the Premier League title in true underdog fashion to become champions in the 2015-16 season. But, the design elements used for the new shirt have also been borrowed from a little further back. A prominent white-collar and neck collar is synonymous with the sides of Jimmy Bloomfield in the 1970s. This is combined with intricacies from the shirts of the '80s, back when Gary Lineker and Alan Smith played for the team. All the shirts are made using 60% recycled content, which comes from adidas' commitment to improving sustainability with their products. Shirts for Adults will be priced at ¬£63.00 and ¬£45.00 for juniors. Leicester City's 2022/23 home kit will be released on the adidas site in the coming days.

'Come to Arsenal!' - How Gabriel Magalhaes convinced Gabriel Jesus to join Arsenal,"Arsenal's Gabriel Magalhaes has revealed how he convinced compatriot Gabriel Jesus to join the Gunners this season. The Brazilian central defender is helping a fellow countryman to adjust and settle in the new environment of Emirates Stadium. A proven Premier League performer impressed in pre-season on the back of a ¬£45 million ($55m) transfer from Manchester City and has plenty of familiar faces around him in north London. The Brazilian suggested that after the 2021-22 season ended, both of the Gabriels were in Brazil's national team camp on international duty and that is when Magalhaes spoke to Jesus about his future. He told Sky Sports: ""Gabriel is a really good guy. Of course, it helps that we have the Brazilian link. When we were on international duty, we discussed his future and I was telling him, 'Come to Arsenal! Come to Arsenal! Maybe I had a bit of an influence there."" The defender continued, ""He is someone who is very focused and really enjoys working hard.  He is here to improve the team and he is already doing that. He has come here with big expectations. He wants to achieve big things with Arsenal. I think he is really going to help us."" Oleksandr Zinchenko ended up following Jesus to Arsenal from City, while deals have also been wrapped up for Brazilian starlet Marquinhos, USMNT goalkeeper Matt Turner and Portuguese playmaker Fabio Vieira.

"Man Utd need to be ready for discipline under Ten Hag, says Dalot","Diogo Dalot believes Manchester United need to hear the harsh home truths Erik ten Hag has brought to bear upon them if they are to rebound to their best this term, after completing an unbeaten pre-season tour of the Far East and Australia. The Red Devils slipped to a late draw in their final game against Aston Villa but otherwise completed a clean sweep under the Dutchman, to post an impressive start to their tenure under the former Ajax boss. Squad members have already talked up the dramatic shift in approach from the manager compared to his predecessors, enforcing a stricter regime, and now Dalot says that his methods are what will be needed - even if it means listening to things they do not want to. ""It is discipline,"" Dalot stated. ""We need to be ready for that, to be ready to hear things that maybe we don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äì everything is for the greater good of the team and that‚Äôs the most important thing. ‚ÄúI feel that we start from scratch: new manager, new stuff, new energy, new players coming in and we‚Äôre looking forward to playing with them as well.

""I feel like I‚Äôm a Man United player, but obviously work every single day to play. I want to be ready for the manager, for the club ‚Äì every time he needs me I‚Äôm going to be there. I need to show my qualities as well. This is why I came here, to show to this club I‚Äôm capable of playing many games for it. This is what I want. Dalot also refused to be drawn on Cristiano Ronaldo's current absence, but gave his support for his Portugal team-mate too, adding: ""I think Cristiano is important for us.

"Rangnick: With Greenwood out of the squad, Man Utd lack strikers","Ralf Rangnick says Manchester United will need to sign at least two strikers this summer with the club still struggling for numbers with Mason Greenwood's exclusion from the team. Greenwood has been out of the squad since January after the 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. With Greenwood out of the team, Man Utd have relied mostly on 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, with veteran Edinson Cavani and out-of-form Marcus Rashford struggling to provide the goals needed to ease the load on the Portuguese star's shoulders.

Barcelona's Aubameyang makes El Clasico history with brace in Real Madrid thrashing,"Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has become the first player to score in five successive games against Real Madrid in the 21st century after notching a brace in Sunday's El Clasico. The Gabon captain steered Xavi's men to a shocking 4-0 victory over La Liga leaders with his contribution of two goals and an assist. Aubameyang broke the deadlock for the visitors at the Santiago Bernabeu with his 29th-minute effort, from an Ousmane Dembele assist. The 2015 African Footballer of the Year later turned up with an assist for Ferran Torres to make it 3-0 for Barcelona in the 47th minute, quickly followed by his second goal of the night to make it 4-0 in the 51st minute and seal the points. He was in action for 71 minutes before he was replaced by Memphis Depay. With his contribution on Sunday, Aubameyang is the first player to be directly involved in three goals in his first El Clasico appearance in all competitions in the 21st century. The 32-year-old who moved to Camp Nou on a free transfer from Arsenal in January, has now scored seven goals in seven league games for the Blaugrana while his overall tally across all competitions is nine goals in 11 appearances. The triumph leaves Barcelona unmoved in the Spanish top-flight table as they occupy the third spot with 54 points after 28 matches, three points behind second-placed Sevilla and 12 points behind leaders Real Madrid.

Salah and Mane should not be obsessed by Ballon d‚ÄôOr - Weah,"Liberia legend George Weah insists Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane should not put unnecessary pressure on themselves to win the Ballon d'Or. The current Liberia president is the only African to have won the coveted prize during his time as a footballer. With their current exploits, many believe Salah and Mane are in the running for the annual award. The former has helped Egypt reach the final of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations as well as the 2022 World Cup play-off. He currently has 22 Premier League goals and 12 assists. Salah has further scored eight goals in 10 Champions League matches where the team is in the semi-finals and he, alongside Mane, have already won the League Cup and are in the FA Cup final. Mane led Senegal to Afcon glory as well as a place in the 2022 World Cup to be held in Qatar. He has scored 14 goals for Liverpool in the league and provided two assists. The 30-year-old has further scored three Champions League goals this season. Weah has, however, advised the duo not to be obsessed with the Ballon d'Or but to focus on their games. ""They shouldn‚Äôt obsess over the Ballon d‚ÄôOr, rather they should focus on their performances and try to improve more,"" the former Milan striker told Canal+.

That move is being made after nine successful years at Santiago Bernabeu that delivered over 300 appearances and 18 trophies. Many of those successes were enjoyed alongside Portuguese superstar Ronaldo, and Casemiro is hoping that a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner will stick around at Old Trafford long enough for the pair to enjoy more triumphs together in England. Questions continue to be asked about whether Ronaldo will see out the summer transfer window at United, as he pushes for a switch elsewhere, but Casemiro is looking forward to working with an all-time great again.

'Man Utd brought in a sporting director!' - Scholes questions Rangnick's coaching after Southampton draw,"Paul Scholes has said that Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick lacks coaching experience after his side's 1-1 draw against Southampton on Saturday.  The Red Devils were denied the three points at Old Trafford when a Che Adams goal cancelled out Jadon Sancho's first-half opener. It is the second time in a row United have failed to get a win in the Premier League, having drawn 1-1 with bottom side Burnley in midweek. Former United midfielder Scholes was critical of the way the team played in their latest slip up and he suggested interim boss Rangnick is not a good fit for the club.    He said on BT Sport: ""It's been a bad seven days. It's really been a bad six or seven months. The season's not been good enough.  ""The sack for Ole was coming, we all knew that, but where was the plan? You think there has to be a plan, they must be bringing in an elite, top coach into the football club.  ""It's Man United, they should have the best of everything. To not have a plan and bring in a, what is technically a sporting director. I think he's coached a team two years out of the last 10 years.  ""Don't get me wrong, I like the man, he comes across really well. He looks like he's lacked experience in coaching for the last five or six years. ""They're a team of individuals. You look at the difference today in Man United's team to Southampton. Southampton were brilliant today. The coaching, the methods, the centre-forwards, midfield players were fantastic.  ""You look at United and they're a little bit all over the place. One time McTominay's left on his own in midfield, then it's Pogba left on his own in midfield. Where Bruno Fernandes is playing I don't know. He's absolutely all over the pitch.  ""The two wide players, for me, don't work anywhere hard enough.

'Ronaldo is a fantastic human being' - Dalot hails Portugal star's impact at Man Utd and welcomes Ten Hag clarity,"Diogo Dalot has revealed the impact Cristiano Ronaldo has had in the Manchester United dressing room this season, while also hailing the club's appointment of Erik ten Hag, who he describes as a ""great manager"". Man Utd brought Ronaldo back to the club from Juventus in a ¬£20 million ($25m) deal last summer, 13 years from his initial departure to Real Madrid. The 37-year-old has since been the Red Devils' main source of goals, netting 23 across all competitions in the 2021-22 campaign, and Dalot says he is also a great source of inspiration behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Speaking ahead of Man Utd's next Premier League game, against Brentford, the Portuguese defender told Sky Sports of Ronaldo: ""I'm sure I speak not just for me but he's been one of the most positive things about this season - to work with somebody who has his culture of working, his professionalism, his mentality and being close to him now, it's been very helpful for me and my career. ""I don't have any more compliments to give about the way he works, he's a fantastic human being as well. The numbers are there, the stats are there, so we're obviously very happy to have him here."" Dalot added on how the rest of the squad gets on with Ronaldo: ""He's a very friendly person. When he feels he has the trust of other people, he gives 100 per cent of himself to you. ""Everybody gets along with him here, everyone likes to have him around. It's always a big plus to have a player and a person like this in the changing room."" Dalot went on to discuss the appointment of Ten Hag, who will replace Ralf Rangnick in the Old Trafford dugout at the end of his final season with Ajax. The full-back is glad the squad has the clarity of a permanent boss to work with after Rangnick's six-month interim spell in charge, and feels Ten Hag has all the qualities to be successful in Manchester. ""I don't think you need to see a lot to know that he is a great manager - what he's done with Ajax is something outstanding,"" said Dalot. ""He plays very attractive football, I think every fan of United is excited to have a manager like this, and we as the players are as well. ""In our heads, it's going to be clear who the manager will be next season and that's good because we go for our break in our heads knowing who to expect.

Explained: Why are tennis fans shouting Cristiano Ronaldo's 'Siiu' celebration at the Australian Open?,"Tennis star Andy Murray fell victim to a curious sporting clash of cultures as his Australian Open victory was greeted by a constant round of ""Siiiu"" shouts. Fans at the Rod Laver Arena were in full voice while the Scot downed Nikoloz Basilashvili in the first round of the Grand Slam. Both he and local favourite Nick Kyrgios were bemused by the chant - but why did it take hold? Frankly, it is impossible to know just why the 'Siiiu' chant has taken hold at the Australian Open this year. Yet its 'inventor', Cristiano Ronaldo, is one of the world's most famous sportsmen, and the phrase has become synonymous with the Manchester United star, who often screams it out as he celebrates. As for its meaning, it is simply ""yes"" in Ronaldo's native Portuguese, albeit with the sound exaggerated and prolonged for extra dramatic effect. Ronaldo's 'Siuuu' celebration COMPLETELY overtook the Australian Open last night! üòÇüòÇüòÇ #AusOpen - Live on Channel 9 and 9Now pic.twitter.com/LE8bMXI2Ct ""The scream?

""It‚Äôs our shout, from Real Madrid."" Murray, on the other hand, was less than impressed.

I have no idea what for,"" he told reporters. ""But then after a few times it was like, 'No, they're doing that, I think it's like 'Siuu' or something that Ronaldo does when he scores. And, yeah, it was incredibly irritating."" The flamboyant Kyrgios offered a more colourful evaluation: ""It's just a stupid [chant], f*ck, I can't believe they did it so much.

Maguire must silence the boo boys with better Man Utd performances,"Ralf Rangnick has been pretty straight when it comes to answering journalists‚Äô questions in press conferences during his four months at Manchester United.¬† But there was one question on Friday lunchtime, at the club‚Äôs Carrington training base, that the German manager did not have an explanation for.¬† He, along with many others, could not understand why Harry Maguire was booed while playing for England over the international break.¬† Three Lions' boss Gareth Southgate was strong in his condemnation of the fans' reaction and Maguire‚Äôs international team-mates have all come out to back the Man Utd captain.¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get my head around what has happened at Wembley tonight,‚Äù Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson wrote on Instagram.  ‚ÄúHarry Maguire has been a colossus for England. Without him, the progress made at the last two tournaments would not have been possible. To be booed at his home stadium, for no reason? What have we become?  ""What happened tonight was just wrong. As someone who wants to win with England, I feel fortunate to share a dressing room with him. We all feel the same!‚Äù¬† The bemusement for most came because Maguire‚Äôs performances in an England shirt cannot really be faulted. He was named in the Euro 2020 team of the tournament and was a key figure in helping Southgate‚Äôs side reach the final.  He has played for England 14 times since October 2020, with 12 wins, no defeats, 10 clean sheets and has scored six goals. They have only conceded five goals in his last 19 appearances in an England shirt.  It was only nine months ago his name was being sung down Wembley Way as fans basked in the excitement of reaching the Euro final.¬† Yet here we were back at the same venue less than a year later and he was being booed.¬† We don‚Äôt know why some of¬†those inside Wembley decided to boo him during the game against Ivory Coast on Tuesday night.  Presumably it is because he has been in poor form for United recently and the fans felt like he didn‚Äôt deserve his place in Southgate‚Äôs latest squad.  Based on performances this season United fans do indeed have reason to be aggrieved with the centre-back‚Äôs displays but not England fans. ¬†The Old Trafford supporters are expected to show their support for the 29-year-old when they host Leicester at Old Trafford on Saturday evening.¬† ‚ÄúI speak regularly with him since I came here and he knows my position towards him, he's been a very valuable player and the captain of the team and the club,‚Äù Rangnick said on Friday.  ‚ÄúI didn't understand what was going on at Wembley but I‚Äôm pretty sure it won't happen in our stadium with the Red Army behind the team and the club and the captain.  ""He's a very important player and he‚Äôs been playing well for Manchester United and England in the last couple of years.‚Äù¬† Club supporters are fiercely loyal to their players and Maguire will discover that when he leads the team out on Saturday afternoon. But their loyalty isn‚Äôt blind and, while they are expected to vocally back the defender, there is an acceptance that performances do need to improve.¬† The reverse fixture against Leicester was one of Maguire‚Äôs worst displays of the season. He was rushed back into the starting XI after injury and he looked slow, rusty and generally poor as he was jeered by the home supporters at the King Power Stadium.  His inclusion in that line-up also caused issues in the United dressing room and more questions were raised over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer‚Äôs management.¬† Rangnick does not have the same loyalty to Maguire as Solskjaer did. He is not afraid to drop him and has left him out of the team on three occasions since he arrived in December.  Maguire has discovered that he is not undroppable despite the captain‚Äôs armband and the club privately acknowledge that there is room for improvement in his displays of late.¬† For all the criticism thrown at the ¬£80 million ($105m) man, a lot of which has been justified, there is the feeling that while his on-field displays can be critiqued his actions off it cannot.¬† Online cynics suggest he has undertaken certain tasks as ‚Äògood PR‚Äô after some poor performances but his recent behaviour is in keeping with what he has done since he joined. He has always retained a keen interest in helping the younger players at the club and asked if he could speak to the under-18s ahead of their FA Youth Cup semi-final at Old Trafford before cheering them on from the stands last month.  More recently he has met with the families of some of the U18s players when they signed their first professional contract.¬† His help for Paul Woolston, the 23-year-old who was forced into early retirement due to injury, has also been commended. Maguire met with him for half an hour on the day he found out he had to hang up his boots to offer a range of opportunities that the goalkeeper is going to explore.¬† That was a classy touch and not something to detract away from his own displays. But no number of nice gestures will distract from poor performances on the pitch. The only way to silence the boo boys and those doubting his ability is to up his level on the pitch.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maguire-must-silence-boos-better-man-utd-performances/blt68b4da58017c369c,Charlotte Duncker,82608520-e313-4f74-838c-611923aa7c10

"West Ham vs Leeds United: Predictions, odds & betting tips","West Ham will be aiming to bolster their position in the Premier League‚Äôs top four when they welcome Leeds to the London Stadium on Sunday. The Hammers are two points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who take on sixth-placed Tottenham later on in the day. Having won each of their last four matches in all competitions, West Ham are 8/13 (1.62) favourites with bet365 to give their Champions League chances a boost with another victory. Marcelo Bielsa‚Äôs Leeds were beaten 2-0 by this opposition at this ground in last weekend‚Äôs FA Cup clash but are available at 4/1 (5.0) to exact revenge by coming out on top. None of the four previous encounters between this duo has resulted in a draw, but there are odds of 16/5 (4.20) on this one finishing up all square. Michail Antonio is the 4/1 (5.0) favourite to open the scoring after goals in two of his last four league games, while Jarrod Bowen can be backed at 6/1 (7.0) after scoring three times in his last three matches Patrick Bamford can be backed at 7/1 (8.0) to return from injury with the opening goal, with top scorer Raphinha priced at 10/1 (11.0) to add to his eight league goals by scoring first. Having beaten Leicester, Tottenham, Liverpool and Chelsea at the London Stadium in the league this season, David Moyes‚Äô team will back themselves to secure a second home victory over this opposition within the space of seven days. Indeed, their visitors have struggled on the road all season, with their only win in 12 away fixtures coming against rock-bottom Norwich. What‚Äôs more, the Whites have conceded 12 goals in just their last three away fixtures, although have only failed to score in four of their last 23 league games. With West Ham averaging two goals per game at home in the league, odds of 13/10 (2.30) seem generous on them coming out on top in their fifth match in seven and Leeds‚Äô sixth successive game to feature over 2.5 goals.

Frustrated Hazard has ‚Äònever been as fit‚Äô but Real Madrid still want to sell after making Belgian an outcast,"By Jorge C. Picon ‚Äì When Eden Hazard arrived at Real Madrid in the summer of 2019, nobody could have imagined that three years later he would have become a bit-part player in a Blancos squad working under the tutelage of Carlo Ancelotti. The Belgium international was, however, left on the bench for a 4-0 humbling by Barcelona on Sunday and has now spent five successive games stuck on the sidelines ‚Äì with his last outing coming against Alaves on February 19, when he saw just six minutes of action. He has now failed to figure in all seven of the Clasico contests that have been played out during his time in Spain ‚Äì due to injuries and questions of his form ‚Äì and appears to have lost all faith from the coaching staff at Santiago Bernabeu. GOAL has learned that Hazard is confused and frustrated by his omission from Ancelotti‚Äôs plans as he believes fitness struggles of the past are behind him. Those close to the 31-year-old forward have said of his failure to take the field against Barcelona: ‚ÄúHe really wanted to play the game. He's sad. He has never been as fit as he is today in his entire career.‚Äù Hazard feels he is doing all he can to convince the Italian manager of his worth, but Ancelotti continues to favour Vinicius Junior on the left flank while Rodrygo and Marco Asensio compete for game time on the right of central frontman Karim Benzema. With others becoming go-to options in attacking berths, Hazard and fellow outcast Gareth Bale are left kicking their heels in the shadows. Saul Niguez suggests why Eden Hazard has struggled at Real Madrid üßê pic.twitter.com/XvIudnSeUz With a man acquired from Chelsea for ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£83m/$110m) making little impression on the first-team fold at present, it is understood that Real‚Äôs intention remains to move Hazard on in the summer of 2022. A loan deal may become the only feasible option for all parties, with Real still having to cover some salary costs there, as finding a buyer for a player whose value has plummeted while working on a lucrative contract will not be easy. The Premier League is considered to represent the best market for Hazard, with his stock still high there following a memorable seven-year stint at Stamford Bridge. A return to Chelsea was ready to be explored, due to obvious emotional ties, but sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich and an ongoing takeover saga in west London have complicated matters considerably. For his part, Hazard has not been rocking the boat in Madrid and will wait patiently for a solution to be found that brings a testing period in his career to a close. He does not want to make a move for the sake of it, potentially doing even more harm to his career, but bosses behind the scenes at the Bernabeu will continue to monitor his situation closely ahead of another window of opportunity swinging open in June.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/frustrated-hazard-never-been-as-fit-real-madrid-want-sell/blt9c62b7f1c96c6afb,GOAL,94307042-e452-4f03-b6d4-fbb0ee897f1f
Manchester United's treble winners of 1999: Where are they now?,"Manchester United's treble-winning campaign of 1998-99 remains unrivalled in English football. Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary side's achievement is still the benchmark, with the manner in which they clinched the Champions League making for arguably the most dramatic finale of all time.  Bayern had taken¬†the lead in the sixth minute, courtesy Mario Basler's free-kick. And the Germans looked set to be crowned kings of Europe right up until the 91st minute.  By that stage, Ferguson had already thrown on Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in a bid to salvage his treble tilt ‚Äì and the two substitutes proved the difference. Sheringham's last-ditch intervention set the game on course for extra time ‚Äì but when Solskjaer stabbed home the winner in the 93rd minute, it completed a stunning turnaround, sparking wild scenes at Camp Nou.

What will Cristiano Ronaldo do when he retires from playing?,"Cristiano Ronaldo intends to keep playing football for as long as his body allows and he works fastidiously on maintaining a peak physical condition in defiance of¬†time's unrelenting march. But, no matter what he does, time will inevitably prevail and¬†the sculpted Portuguese will eventually be forced to hang up his boots for good. Most footballers are keenly aware that their trade is fickle and could cease at any time, meaning¬†the question of what to do when that¬†day comes is never far from their thoughts. So, as he enters into the final stages of his career, what does Ronaldo have in mind? Goal takes a look at the Man Utd star's retirement plans. Ronaldo has hinted at a number of potential avenues for exploration when he retires from playing football, including coaching, acting and pursuing studies. Ronaldo revealed, in December 2019, that one of his ambitions¬†was to ""challenge [himself]"" by playing a part on the big screen. ""I hope I live more than 50 years to learn new things and face different challenges and try to find solutions for them,"" Ronaldo told¬†a Dubai Sports¬†conference.¬† ""One of the things that I seek to challenge myself in, for example, is acting in a movie."" The former Manchester United star wouldn't be the first footballer to transition into acting, with Vinnie Jones, Pele and (to a lesser extent) David Beckham being notable examples. However, at risk of offending Ronaldo's ego, it seems very unlikely that 'CR7' will land a lead role in a Hollywood blockbuster or find himself in the running¬†for an Oscar any time soon. Moving into coaching is a well worn path for ex-players and¬†Ronaldo was famously depicted 'coaching' Portugal to victory alongside head coach Fernando Santos in the final of Euro 2016. Such images would suggest a flair for the craft of coaching, but Ronaldo has been equivocal when pressed on whether he has designs on becoming a coach or manager. ""Right now, I'm not interested in becoming a coach, but maybe one day I will be bored and I will feel like it,"" he told¬†DAZN Italy in late 2019.¬†""Never say never. ""If I became a coach, I would be a motivator, the coach must pass on his passion¬†and talent¬†to the team. ""For example, I like to have fun, dribble, shoot, score goals,¬†I should pass this on to the team, as a motivator."" Changing roles from being the star player who can do it all to the coach who must inspire others to do it all may be off-putting for Ronaldo. Indeed, simply being a great footballer does not mean that one will become a great coach overnight and, in many cases, great coaches have had quite average playing careers.¬† For example, Diego Maradona is¬†widely regarded as one of the best footballers ever, but has struggled for success as a coach and continues to endure ridicule. Arrigo Sacchi, meanwhile, was a mere amateur footballer, yet masterminded a golden age for AC Milan and led Italy to a World Cup final. If he does move into coaching, Ronaldo would be wise not to do it out of boredom, as he suggests, and look to the blueprint of obsessive success stories such as Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola. Ronaldo has said that he would like to ""continue [his] studies"" when his playing days draw to a close. However, it is not clear if he means pursuing a university degree, as a number of other footballers have. ""I always recommend learning all that is new. This is what I always strive for,"" said the forward.¬†""I always seek to educate myself, because my studies tend to¬†answer many of the questions on my mind. ""We have to learn the best of others, and this is an important part¬†in helping me achieve what I have reached now."" It might be hard to picture someone like¬†Ronaldo strutting through a university campus with a collection of books tucked under his arm, but there are plenty of examples of footballers with degrees. In fact, many have completed college courses while still playing, getting stuck into literature in their downtime instead of whiling away hours on the golf course. Former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Spain midfielder Juan Mata are notable examples, as well as Brazil legend Socrates. Long before retirement was ever an imminent consideration for Ronaldo, he had cultivated a long line of business interests outside of football and they are sure to keep him occupied when he stops playing. He is a hotelier (Pestana CR7), a fashion mogul with various CR7 lines of clothing and lifestyle offerings (including a hair transplant clinic) and has dabbled in the fitness industry with a number of gyms. One potential business avenue Ronaldo could explore, but has not spoken of yet,¬†is owning a football team. With the wealth that he has accumulated over his career, it is a realistic option and has been done. Beckham, the man whose No.7¬†shirt Ronaldo inherited when he joined Manchester United and whose stardom he emulated, has eschewed coaching, but remains involved in football, with ownership stakes. The former England captain is the owner of Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and has a small stake in Salford City (along with Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville, Gary Neville and Nicky Butt). Ronaldo's namesake Ronaldo Nazario (the 'real Ronaldo' for some) bought a majority share in Spanish club Real Valladolid in 2018, four years after his involvement with Fort Lauderdale Strikers.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-will-cristiano-ronaldo-do-when-he-retires/10rc1rz38smcd18aetazzo83dn,GOAL,c3c636d5-4a32-43c6-aef4-e2a49eceb9af
Balotelli dropped from Italy squad as European champions face 2022 World Cup play-offs,"Mario Balotelli has been omitted from Italy's squad for the March international break, as Roberto Mancini names his 33-man party for the Azzurri's crucial Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers. The striker, who currently plays with Adana Demirspor in the Super Lig, earned a recall to the national team in Janaury, having not played for them since 2018, but finds himself on the fringes again as the nation prepares for up to two must-win matches. Less than a year on from their unbeaten triumph at Euro 2020 against England, they face the prospect of a second successive no-show at the World Cup. While Balotelli is far from the only eye-catching absence, his omission is the one likely to generate the most interest given his surprise return to the squad for a training camp in January. But the fiery striker is not the only one left out in the cold, with Juventus' Federico Bernardeschi, Sassuolo's Davide Frattesi and Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret also among those who are missing from the final party. There are recalls however for shotstopper duo Gianluigi Donnarumma and Pierluigi Gollini, Chelsea playmaker Jorginho and Lyon defender Emerson Palmieri, who were all absent in the winter. Having beaten England at Wembley in a penalty shootout to claim European glory last year, the Azzurri promptly struggled to replicate their form across the autumn, managing just two wins from seven games to fall short of automatic qualification behind Switzerland. It meant that they were forced to fall into the secound round of UEFA's qualifcation, where they were drawn in Path C, alongside Portugal, Turkey and North Macedonia. They will face the latter in Palermo on March 24 - and if they win, will travel to either Porto or Konya to square off with the other victorious nation for a place at Qatar 2022.

'Messi told everyone to stop calling me ginger!' - Mac Allister reveals PSG superstar defended him in Argentina training,"Alexis Mac Allister has revealed that Lionel Messi jumped to his defence in an Argentina training session, with the Paris Saint-Germain superstar warning the rest of their team-mates to stop calling him ""ginger"". Mac Allister has been included in Argentina's latest squad for their final World Cup qualifying fixtures against Chile and Colombia, having impressed for Brighton in the first half of the 2021-22 campaign. The 23-year-old has two senior caps to his name so far and also starred for his country's U23s at the Tokyo Olympics last summer, but is still waiting to play his first game alongside Messi. The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner won't be with Argentina during the latest international break after being given extra time off to recover from Covid-19, but Mac Allister has at least already had the opportunity to train with his idol. The Seagulls midfielder bonded with Messi in a somewhat unexpected fashion while on international duty last year, avoiding becoming the butt of a personal joke thanks to the 34-year-old's intervention. ‚ÄúI trained with him when I was in the Argentinian squad twice, but I didn‚Äôt play with him,‚Äù Mac Allister has told The Athletic. ‚ÄúIt was fantastic, the same as in the matches he trains. It‚Äôs something you cannot believe. ‚ÄúI remember everyone called me ‚ÄòColo‚Äô, which is ginger in Argentina. I don‚Äôt like it much and he told the team-mates that. He said, ‚ÄòHe doesn‚Äôt like to be called Colo, so don‚Äôt call him that!‚Äô.‚Äù The Brighton star also spoke about meeting Messi for the first time: ‚ÄúI was red, completely red. I didn‚Äôt want even to say hello. I was really nervous even to meet one of the best players in the world, but it was fantastic, of course. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not going to forget. It was magic when my dad played with Maradona and I could train with Lionel Messi. We are very proud of it.‚Äù Mac Allister has gradually established himself as one of Brighton's most consistent performers since moving to the Amex Stadium from Argentinos Juniors in 2019. The talented young playmaker had other options before choosing the Seagulls, but says the advice he received from countryman and former Manchester United and Manchester City star Carlos Tevez helped convince him to head to England. ‚ÄúTevez said the Premier League is the best in the world and [Mauro] Zarate said the Italian league, Serie A, is the best,‚Äù said Mac Allister. ‚ÄúCarlos was in love with the English people, with the league, with everything here. He showed it here and he enjoyed it.  ""I supported Carlos, so I think we won the argument! The Premier League is fantastic. It‚Äôs nice when you play. I want to play and I need to play. It‚Äôs fantastic to be here and to be at this club is special.‚Äù The Argentina international has helped Brighton rise to ninth in the Premier League table after 22 games this season, but he says it has taken him time to get used to the physical demands of the competition. ‚ÄúPhysically, that‚Äôs the most important thing I had to improve, gym and training,‚Äù Mac Allister continued. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why the pandemic was hard, because I couldn‚Äôt train with my team-mates, to be every day at the training ground. ‚ÄúI ‚Äòlost‚Äô maybe two or three months. That wasn‚Äôt good for me to settle in. When I go to the gym now, the strength and conditioning trainer says I‚Äôm much stronger than when I arrived.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-told-everyone-to-stop-calling-me-ginger-mac-allister/bltd59749852eb6a8c3,James Westwood,b1f6d0d7-9ca9-40f1-90fb-636d3034597c
"'Anfield is hell' - Liverpool will try to 'kill' Villarreal stars in Champions League clash, warns Capoue","Liverpool will try to 'kill' Villarreal in their Champions League semi-final clash at Anfield, according to Etienne Capoue, who has described playing at the Merseyside club's home stadium as ""hell"". Villarreal will be competing in the last four of the Champions League for only the second time in their history when they travel to Liverpool on Wednesday night, having recorded surprise wins over Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous rounds. Unai Emery's side will be heavy underdogs once again against the Reds, and Capoue has warned his team-mates to expect a hostile atmosphere in the first leg at Anfield. Former Tottenham and Watford midfielder Capoue played in England for eight years before joining Villarreal last summer, and doesn't have fond memories of his previous outings at Liverpool's iconic stadium. ""Anfield is hell, you have to say it how it is. It‚Äôs hell,"" the 33-year-old told AFP. ""It‚Äôs the worst stadium I‚Äôve been to in England. Whether it‚Äôs the atmosphere, the way they play. For 90 minutes, you live in hell. ""They have this ability to transcend themselves, to cause you nothing but problems, all the time, in any part of the field. ""They never stop, they rush you all the time, they only want to score goals, and even when they score, they carry on. They want to knock you out. ""They don‚Äôt care what or who is in front of them. They just want to kill everyone and that‚Äôs it."" Capoue is well aware that Liverpool are the overwhelming favourites to reach the final, but he is not fazed by the fact that so many pundits and supporters are writing off Villarreal's chances. The Frenchman says the 2021 Europa League winners showed no fear against Juve or Bayern and will approach the two legs against the Reds in the same fashion as they strive to ""enjoy this moment"". ""Winning the Champions League? We never had the audacity to say we could win the Champions League,"" Capoue added. ""We‚Äôre the smallest club in the semi-finals, we were the smallest club in the quarter-finals. We‚Äôre just making our merry way. And we have nothing to lose. ""We‚Äôre in the semis which shows we weren‚Äôt afraid of Juventus or Bayern. We don‚Äôt care, we know we‚Äôre underdogs. ""We‚Äôre not a big team but we‚Äôre a solid team, playing for the love of football, that wants to enjoy this moment. Because what we‚Äôre experiencing is incredible. ""Nobody will say we‚Äôre favourites because we‚Äôre not. Who are the other teams? What else can we say about them?

Mane backtracks on Liverpool exit comments amid Bayern Munich & PSG transfer reports,"Sadio Mane has backtracked on his Liverpool exit comments amid transfer reports linking him with Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain, insisting he still has a lot of respect for the Reds. Mane only has one year left on his current deal at Liverpool and there has been no sign of an extension being agreed, leading to major question marks over his future at Anfield. Indeed, GOAL reported after the Reds' Champions League final loss to Real Madrid that the 30-year-old has already made the decision to move on, with Bayern touted as his most likely next destination. Mane gave the clearest indication yet that he is set to leave Liverpool before Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations qualifying clash against Benin on Saturday. He said that ""between 60 and 70 per cent"" of Senegalese supporters would like him to secure a summer transfer and promised to ""do what they want"". Those remarks naturally added extra fuel to the rumour mill, with PSG also reportedly interested in Mane's services, but he has now insisted that he wasn't being serious in the pre-match conference. Speaking after scoring a hat-trick in Senegal's 3-1 win over Benin, the Liverpool star told Canal Plus: ""I spoke yesterday while joking with a bit of humour and it was everywhere. I think we'll stop there. ""Liverpool is a club I respect a lot. The fans adopted me since day one. Regarding the future, we'll see."" Mane also spoke to reporters in the mixed zone after the game, and was asked which team he prefers between Real Madrid and Barcelona. His reply suggested that another surprise club might yet emerge as contenders for his signature. ‚ÄúYou know, you've got me in trouble with the Liverpool fans right now but hey,"" Mane chuckled. ""Those two teams are not bad. But I'm not a fan of those teams. You know, my team is Marseille, so I would say Marseille.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-backtracks-on-liverpool-exit-comments-amid-bayern/blt6842e789e1527251,James Westwood,320f8e35-022f-4e97-9bdf-2ca342ea7838
Klopp makes Liverpool history with Reds on all-time record away winning run,"Jurgen Klopp has led Liverpool to a clutch of new records with a history-making Champions League quarter-final first leg win over Benfica on Tuesday. Goals for Ibrahima Konate, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz helped the Reds to victory away from home to put thems in prime position to make the semi-finals in the return leg at Anfield next weekend. Victory also extended an impressive run of form for the Merseyside outfit that saw the club write themselves a new bit of history in the process. Under the German, Liverpool have now won each of their last eight away games in all competitions, their longest ever such winning run. They've scored 16 goals during that run, conceding just twice. The Reds have also won five consecutive away games in their Champions League and European Cup history for just the second time, last doing so in September 1984 under Joe Fagan. They have also beaten Benfica in a Champions League or European Cup match for the first time since October 1984, when they also won 3-1, having lost their previous three such meetings before tonight without scoring a goal in the process. Liverpool's victory on the road in Portugal puts them in a prime position to earn themselves a last four berth, as they go in search of a second Champions League crown under Klopp. Now the German will turn his attention entirely towards coming up against Manchester City in a crucial Premier League clash this weekend. Victory there will put the Reds in prime position for a second league title under their manager, having previously won the 2019-20 Premier League season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-liverpool-all-time-record-away-winning-run/blt11fd90079ba04287,Andrew Steel,b122c29e-2ef0-4696-9a9d-6fa0509c3fa2
Borussia Dortmund manager Rose explains why Haaland injury comeback is taking so long ,"Borussia Dortmund coach Marco Rose has explained why Erling Haaland‚Äôs return from injury is taking longer than expected. The prolific Norwegian striker has been out of action with a muscle complaint since January 22. He has sat out some important games for Dortmund as they have slipped out of Europe and dropped important points in the Bundesliga, but the 21-year-old will not be rushed back. Dortmund boss Rose said: ‚ÄúErling is still having a few problems, he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with his movement yet. ""We don‚Äôt want to risk another injury or play with his health, and neither does he. It‚Äôs going to take a few more days."" Haaland was replaced 63 minutes into his last outing against Hoffenheim. Since then, he has missed six games in the Bundesliga and Europa League. Dortmund saw their continental exploites for 2021-22 brought to a close with a 6-4 aggregate defeat to Rangers, with Haaland unable to play any part against the Scottish champions. He was also absent for the 5-2 domestic defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen and the 1-1 draw away at Augsburg. Dortmund remain second in the Bundesliga table, but are eight points adrift of holders Bayern Munich with 10 games left to play.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/borussia-dortmund-rose-haaland-injury-comeback/blt64cd2914d46ddbd4,Chris Burton,d22952ee-eab3-4619-aa12-6c2a11dad721
'Male athletes don't feel safe coming out as gay'- USWNT star Rapinoe,"United States women's national team star Megan Rapinoe has said her male counterparts don't feel safe coming out as gay. Speaking about sexual identity in football, she said men ""feel like they're going to get abuse from fans"" if they reveal their true selves. Rapinoe has been at the forefront of social justice issues, including gay rights, throughout her USWNT and club career. ""To everyone in the sporting culture, you have a responsibility to think about what you're saying and ensure that you're creating an environment that's welcoming and open,"" Rapinoe said on The HangOut. ""We get asked all the time - why aren't there more out male athletes in elite sport? It's because they don't feel safe. They feel like they're going to get abuse from fans, they're going to be kicked off teams, have slurs thrown at them, whatever it is. ""It's safer on the women's side - we have a lot of camaraderie between ourselves and people coming out, which makes it easier for everyone. But I would say from sporting directors to club owners, to fans and players, it's your responsibility also."" Indeed, male players have said it would be difficult to be publicly identified as gay in a dressing room. Earlier this year, Patrice Evra spoke of the issue from his own experiences around team-mates who had not come out as gay. ""When I was in England, they brought someone to talk to the team about homosexuality,"" Evra told Le Parisien. ""Some of my colleagues said: 'It is against my religion, if there is a homosexual in this locker room, let him leave the club' and other comments. ""At that time, I said: 'Shut up'. I played with players who were gay. Face to face, they opened up with me because they are afraid to speak otherwise. ""There are at least two players per club who are gay - but in the world of football, if you say so, it's over.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rapinoe-male-athletes-dont-feel-safe-coming-out-as-gay/blt54fe545c623a89d1,Dan Bernstein,40b8913a-1fd3-457d-8bc4-e5c6ed6d50a6

Leeds promise lifetime bans as they identify fans who threw coins at players during Man Utd loss,"Leeds have promised lifetime bans to any fan found to have thrown objects onto the pitch against Manchester United. Home supporters were seen throwing coins and other missiles, with Man Utd's Anthony Elanga struck while celebrating a goal in his side's 4-2 win. Leeds have promised the harshest punishments to those that have been identified, with their images being handed over to local police. ""Following CCTV checks conducted yesterday, we can confirm that a small number of supporters who threw objects onto the pitch at Sunday's match have already been identified,"" Leeds said in a statement. ""As this is a criminal offence, the images and footage have now been handed over to West Yorkshire Police who will seek to arrest the individuals, using the information provided by the club.

Chelsea owner Abramovich victim of suspected 'poisoning' amid Russia-Ukraine peace talks,"Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms of a suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month, sources close to the owner have confirmed to GOAL. The 55-year-old billionaire has since recovered from the alleged attack, which has been attributed to hard-line Russian agents who wanted to disrupt the peace process in the original report by the¬†Wall Street Journal. The symptoms were said to include ""red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands."" The Blues owner is said to have been travelling between Moscow, Ukraine and Turkey since he put Chelsea up for sale on March 2.¬† People close to Abramovich have claimed that he has been involved in peace talks since the war broke out in late February.¬† Indeed, he has been spotted close to the border between Belarus and Ukraine, with his private jets constantly moving between Russia, Belarus and Turkey. After being sanctioned by the UK Government on March 10, the Blues owner was described as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who had has a ""close relationship"" with Vladimir Putin for decades and has obtained ""financial benefit"" and ""preferential treatment"" from that relationship. The European Union (EU) then followed suit and sanctioned Abramovich which caused complications for Chelsea in the day-to-day running of the club.¬† The sale of Chelsea should exist broadly outside of Abramovich's influence for now. New York investment bank Raine Group is managing the sale of the club but the ultimate decision on a new owner rests with Chelsea's board. On that board are several close associates to Abramovich, including Marina Granovskaia, Bruce Buck and Eugene Tenenbaum. The UK Government has limited Chelsea by placing a special operating licence on the club in a bid to ensure no money goes to Abramovich who is currently sanctioned.¬† However, in recent days, there has been talk that Chelsea are seeking to boost the price of the club to record-breaking levels for a sports team.¬† It raises the prospect that the proceeds of the sale could ultimately go to Abramovich after any sanctions are eventually lifted.¬† The current record sale is ¬£2.5 billion, which was spent on the NBA's Brooklyn Nets by Joseph Tsai. Many close to the process, believe that ¬£2.5bn is the minimum the Stamford Bridge club could go for with preferred bidders being encouraged to raise their offers.¬† Among the final four bidders are now known to be the controversial¬†Ricketts family, led by Tom Ricketts and with private backing from Citadel founder Ken Griffin.¬† Furthermore, also from the United States, is¬†Todd Boehly who owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. His consortium features finance from Switzerland through billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and British entrepreneur Jonathan Goldstein.¬† Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen Pagliuca, who also has a stake in Atalanta, emerged as a bidder late in the process.¬† Meanwhile, there's also a consortium fronted by former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton. It features prominent backing from Lord Sebastian Coe, a Conservative Party MP, and US billionaire duo Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own a stake in Crystal Palace.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-owner-abramovich-victim-of-suspected-poisoning-amid/blte0fa29d9f51d7264,Nizaar Kinsella,bd097c39-f7a3-4b65-b662-a1ee8c6af468

"Costa Rica vs Canada: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Canada are looking to strengthen their hold on first place in the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying group when they visit Costa Rica on Thursday. The visitors have a four-point lead at the top of the table and are close to securing a place in the finals in Qatar.  Their opponents, however, are pushing to overtake Panama and seal the inter-continental play-off spot with three games left to play.   The table-toppers are unbeaten so far in qualifying and have won their last six matches in the group. Canada are the favourites to win in Costa Rica at 7/5 (2.4) with bet365 while the home side are offered at 21/10 (3.1). A draw between the two teams is available at 2/1 (3.0). Jonathan David can be backed at 11/2 (6.5) to score the game's first goal, while Cyle Larin, the top scorer in CONCACAF qualifying, is available at 6/1 (7.0). Costa Rica star Joel Campbell, meanwhile, is priced at 13/2 (7.5) to break the deadlock and Anthony Contreras can be backed at 7/1 (8.0). Canada are looking to secure their place in a World Cup finals tournament for the first time since 1986. Having won their last six matches in the qualifying round, they will be confident of getting the crucial three points at Costa Rica. They are without star player Alphonso Davies, however, as the Bayern Munich full-back is working his way back to fitness following a heart condition. Plus, fellow left-back Samuel Adekugbe is suspended for this clash. Costa Rica will put up a good fight for the group leaders. They have lost once at home in this stage of the qualifying phase and are pushing to beat Panama to the play-offs. They sit just one point behind Panama and a positive result in this game will give their hopes of overtaking them a significant boost. These two teams have the strongest defensive records in the CONCACAF group, with Canada conceding just five times and Costa Rica a mere seven. This game having under 2.5 goals is priced at 4/9 (1.44) and may prove a smart bet.

Tchouameni to join Real Madrid in ‚Ç¨100m transfer as Blancos agree deal with Monaco,"Real Madrid have won the race for Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni, GOAL can confirm, with the highly-rated midfielder set to join the Blancos in a ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£85m/$107m) deal. The talented 22-year-old has become one of the most sought-after talents in European football, with his star having been on the rise for some time. Leading clubs from across Europe have been credited with holding an interest in his obvious potential, but it is the reigning champions of La Liga that will be benefiting from those qualities in 2022-23. It is understood that a deal for Tchouameni will tip over into nine figures including bonuses, with Real prepared to invest heavily in another shrewd addition for their present and future. A long-term contract at Santiago Bernabeu is expected to take him through to the summer of 2027 ‚Äì with fellow new recruit Antonio Rudiger having recently committed to a four-year deal following his move from Chelsea as a free agent. GOAL was able to announce towards the end of May that Real had an agreement with Monaco for Tchouameni in the pipeline. It was revealed back then that approaches from rival parties had been snubbed in order to give a green light to Spanish heavyweights. Paris Saint-Germain made a late play to keep a hot prospect in his homeland, but were left disappointed, while Liverpool had been keen on taking the youngster to the Premier League. The Blancos are planning long-term in their signing of Tchouameni, although he will still have an important role to play in the present. He is considered to be the natural heir to Casemiro in Real‚Äôs engine room, with a long-serving Brazil international now 30 years of age. Tchouameni will be looking to land as many minutes as possible with Madrid next season alongside fellow countryman Eduardo Camavinga, who made his own big-money move to Spain from Rennes in 2021.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tchouameni-real-madrid-100m-transfer-deal-monaco/blt3666a376006579bb,Jorge C.

Tuchel unhappy with Lukaku performance against Man City as Chelsea boss says he lost possession too much,"Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he was left frustrated by Romelu Lukaku's performance for Chelsea against Manchester City, in Saturday's Premier League defeat at the Etihad Stadium. Kevin De Bruyne's second-half strike was enough to seal a 1-0 victory for Pep Guardiola's hosts, who finished the match with a 13-point lead over the Blues - their nearest rivals - at the summit. Unlike his countryman, Lukaku was frequently unable to effect as much control in a frequently muted showing from the visitors - and speaking after the final whistle, Tuchel acknowledged that he had been left unhappy with his efforts. ""We had eight or nine offensive transitions, but had zero touches in the box,"" the German stated in his post-match comments. ""That was a big problem today, the performance of our front players. A lack of position, timing and composure. We lost too many balls too easily. ""Romelu Lukaku sometimes needs to [deliver] the service. He is included in this, he had many ball losses in very promising circumstances. He had a huge chance. ""Of course we want to serve him, but he is part of the team, and the performance up front, we can do much better. "" The German expounded upon his side's overall performance - where they failed to land a shot on target in the first half - and noted that he felt like they deserved a point at least, while adding that he acknowledges City may now be too far to catch. ""I thought we deserved a draw, we defended very well,"" he added. ""We did not allow big chances. We were not under so much pressure. A draw would be a fair result but we don‚Äôt have it."" ""We will never give up, but if City keep winning every game, nobody can catch them."" With the gap now more than a dozen points, Chelsea's hopes of dethroning City looks to be at an end, with Guardiola claiming revenge for last year's Champions League final loss. The Blues however remain in contention to defend their European crown, and could indeed secure a double still, having made it to the Carabao Cup final earlier this month against Tottenham. City meanwhile will hope to go one step further in Europe this year, having delivered another convincing run through the group stages against tough opposition.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-unhappy-with-lukaku-performance-against-man-city-as/blt6e35c72b8aaccd07,Andrew Steel,71f0303d-b5dd-4e6d-89ed-26020c86b310

'I cannot get sentimental about it' - Chelsea boss Tuchel on Kepa or Mendy choice for Carabao Cup final,"Thomas Tuchel has stressed he ""cannot get sentimental"" over whether Kepa Arrizabalaga or Edouard Mendy starts for Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool, admitting that the pair's form makes it an ""uncomfortable and very comfortable situation"" to have. The Blues square off with the Reds on Sunday at Wembley Stadium as they look to pick up their third trophy of the season following FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup triumphs this term already. First-choice keeper Mendy has played a smaller role in both the road to this clash and those wins, with Kepa sealing victory against Villarreal in the Super Cup penalty shootout and starting through the club's Carabao Cup run. ""First of all I will not tell you [who will start],"" Tuchel teased reporters in his pre-match press conference. ""We will take the decision late, because you have a reason to ask the question. In the last competition, Kepa played in the Club World Cup semi-final and got us to the final. ""And then we took the decision for Edou coming back from the Africa Cup of Nations, and then it's a pretty similar situation now. The very last decision we will take after training, like always. ""Because there's no need to take the decision now when we have one more training ahead. Kepa did fantastic in the period where we had to be without Edou, and so it's an uncomfortable and very comfortable situation at the same time."" Having initially struggled after his Stamford Bridge arrival, before being relegated to second-choice with Mendy's arrival, Kepa has offered a stirring response for Chelsea this term - and Tuchel has acknowledged he is worthy of starting at Wembley, even if he does not.  ""This is very easy to answer: he absolutely deserves to play and I cannot get sentimental about it,"" the German added. ""I have to do what in the end is in my opinion the very best solution for the team. I know that this position is a very sensitive position. ""If Kepa was a player in the other 10 positions we would not have these discussions, we would just be full of praise. But still he would absolutely deserve it and at the same time I will not be sentimental about the position."" Tuchel's selection headaches at the back are at least arguably the worst of his troubles, as he goes in search of a third trophy this term, and with the prospect of further silverware still hanging down the line. Though several faces such as Ben Chilwell and Reece James will be out of the equation, Chelsea will be able to call upon a heavy slate of talent for their clash with Jurgen Klopp's side. Liverpool meanwhile will be without Roberto Firmino after the Brazilian was ruled out with injury - but there is hope for Diogo Jota, whose rich vein of form this term has helped thrust the Reds back into the thick of the Premier League title race.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-cannot-get-sentimental-about-it-chelsea-boss-tuchel-on-kepa-or-/blt4570860afca1058d,Andrew Steel,71bf379c-dbb9-4564-963c-093861110a17
Aston Villa's Matty Cash shown yellow card after removing shirt to display 'stay strong Kedziora' message for team-mate stuck in Ukraine,"Aston Villa's Matty Cash was given a yellow card after unveiling a message in support of Poland team-mate Tomasz Kedziora during his side's clash with Brighton on Saturday. Cash opened the scoring in the first half with a fine strike at the AMEX Community Stadium. And during his celebrations he removed his shirt to reveal a tribute to Kedziora, who is currently stranded in Ukraine as the nation endures military invasion from Russia. ""Tomasz Kedziora and family, stay strong bro,"" read the inscription on the shirt Cash wore under his Villa jersey, which he removed following his goal on Saturday. The gesture earned him a booking, as Premier League rules forbid the removal of the team shirt under any circumstances while on the pitch. Still, he was widely praised for his solidarity with Kedziora, who has played in the Ukrainian capital with Dynamo Kyiv since 2017.

""It's a message to people in Ukraine and he's been booked for it!"" Stelling fired. ""John Brooks is an inexperienced Premier League referee and hopefully, when people come to their senses, they'll ignore that, they should just ignore that."" ‚úã""I'm responsible for the yellow card.""üó£Steven Gerrard gives his thoughts on the Matty Cash yellow card after sending a message to his friend in Ukraine by removing his shirt. pic.twitter.com/MFkrTdyb1l Speaking after the match, Villa boss Steven Gerrard said: ""There's no blame on Cashy at all.  ""I should have mentioned that before the game, to all the players, and I didn't.  ""So I'm responsible for that yellow card but there's certainly no blame towards the Premier League or the player, that's on me."" There is currently no mechanism in the Premier League to overturn or appeal a yellow card, unlike with red cards which can be rescinded following the game if they are deemed unjust. Shirt removal has been an automatic bookable offence since 2004, while in 2014 extra punishment was imposed for players who reveal messages under their jerseys.

Ronaldo on longest goal drought since 2009 as he blanks for sixth game in a row in 1-1 Southampton draw,"Cristiano Ronaldo is now on his longest goal drought in over a decade as the Manchester United star failed to find the back of the net once again on Saturday. The Portuguese has been one of the most prolific goalscorers in the history of the sport, establishing himself amongst the most dominant players of all time. But he has struggled in recent weeks for United and, having been unable to score again in a 1-1 draw with Southampton, he has now been without a goal in six games, five of which have been in the Premier League. The Portuguese icon's last goal came back on December 30, when he netted in a 3-1 win over Burnley. He's failed to score in his six appearances since, including Man United's FA Cup elimination at the hands of Middlesbrough. And Ronaldo, who has scored 688 goals at club level throughout his illustrious career, hasn't gone six games without scoring since all the way back in 2009. That run came during the final months of his first stint at Old Trafford as he would depart for Real Madrid soon after, establishing himself as one of the best players in the history of the sport during his time in Spain. Ronaldo returned to Manchester United this summer, rejoining his former club after a stint at Juventus. He's scored 14 goals so far in all competitions, with six of those goals coming in five Champions League appearances. Man Utd sit fifth in the Premier League after Saturday's draw, with Ronaldo's next chance to end his drought coming against Brighton on Tuesday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-on-longest-goal-drought-since-2009-as-he-blanks-again-in-/blt5b14fe13f3165d72,Ryan Tolmich,1de6559d-58f9-493a-be4b-1f105f18e0a8

'Help Sonny score!' - Son Heung-min reveals Conte half-time message before he won Premier League Golden Boot,"Son Heung-min has revealed the half-time message Antonio Conte gave to the Tottenham squad before he won the Premier League Golden Boot. Spurs have benefitted from Son's impressive instincts in the final third consistently over the past seven years, and 2021-22 was his best campaign yet in terms of goals and assists. The South Korean managed to find the net 23 times in the Premier League to land a share of the Golden Boot alongside Liverpool's Mohamed Salah - but only after a dramatic final day. Spurs were 1-0 up at half-time away at Norwich on May 22 thanks to a Dejan Kulusevski strike as they sought to seal a fourth-place berth, but Son was still behind Salah in the scoring charts. The 29-year-old scored twice in the second period, though, as Tottenham ran out 5-0 winners to pip Arsenal to Champions League qualification, and he has now revealed the role Conte played in helping him land a maiden Golden Ball award. ""I was happy to be awarded, but I was much happier because the team-mates were also delighted. The boss didn‚Äôt consider it, he just focused on the Champions League,"" Son has told a press conference in Korea. ""But he spoke at half-time to the team to help Sonny to score and to get Golden Boots. To be honest, I was a little anxious because I didn‚Äôt have chances to score, but I cheered up after he said that. ""When Lucas Moura and Steve Bergwijn substituted in, they said they will help me score. It was not easy as we are team-mates as well as competitors. I was really happy for them.""

Watch: Incredible fan footage of Man Utd's 1999 Champions League final comeback shared for first time,"Incredible footage of Manchester United's thrilling 1999 Champions League win against Bayern Munich has been shared on the 23rd anniversary of the event. The Red Devils pulled off an incredible comeback in stoppage time at the end of the second half, scoring twice to secure a 2-1 victory. The match has gone down as one of the most thrilling ends to a major final in football history. One United fan managed to get his video camera into Camp Nou for the final in 1999 and record the final minutes of the game. Little did he know that he would catch the two goals that would bring his team back from a goal down to secure a 2-1 victory. The fan had the perfect view of the iconic moments as he stood right behind the Bayern goal. His son posted the footage on Twitter on Thursday, sharing it with the world for the first time. Bayern took the lead in the clash just six minutes in through a goal from Mario Basler. United fought to pull level but seemed to be heading for disappointment as the match entered stoppage time. Sir Alex Ferguson's team were awarded a corner in the dying minutes of the game and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel ran up to the opposition box to help his team-mates out. The Danish shot-stopper got his head to the ball and it found its way to Dwight Yorke at the back post. Bayern failed to clear it properly, sending it to the edge of the box.  Ryan Giggs was there to knock it back towards goal and Teddy Sheringham then managed to fire low past Oliver Kahn from close range. Just 30 seconds after the restart, United won another corner and David Beckham's cross was met by Sheringham, who nodded it down for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to fire in the winning goal.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-incredible-fan-footage-of-man-utd-s-1999-champions/blt96f9dbb77ad3cc5a,Peter McVitie,1aa11726-fbff-4361-86ed-91089d866693

Is Afcon 2021 heading towards a Salah vs Mane final?,"When was the last time the two best African players on the planet collided in the Africa Cup of Nations final? A case could be made, perhaps, for 2002, when El Hadji Diouf‚Äîreigning African Footballer of the Year‚Äîmet Cameroon and a young Samuel Eto‚Äôo, who would win the award in 2003. Maybe 1980? When Segun Odegbami went toe to toe with Lakhdar Belloumi, although the likes of Thomas N‚ÄôKono and Jean Manga-Onguene would have something to say about that. Heading into the semi-finals here in Cameroon, however, a match between Africa‚Äôs top two is still firmly on the cards, with Senegal and Sadio Mane, and Egypt‚Äôs Mohamed Salah still very much on the cards. Some may argue that Riyad Mahrez has eclipsed Mane in recent years, and perhaps at times that‚Äôs been true, but as the reigning African Footballer of the Year, and with eight goals in the Premier League so far this season, the Senegal forward can still stake a strong claim to being second only to Salah in the current hierarchy of continental greats. Certainly, while Mahrez offered precious little before limping out of the competition in the group stage‚Äîmissing a decisive penalty as Algeria were dumped out by the Ivory Coast‚ÄîMane is growing into the competition. He has netted twice and registered one assist so far, bagging in the narrow 1-0 victory over Zimbabwe to kick off Senegal‚Äôs campaign, before registering against Cape Verde in the Round of 16 only moments after sustaining a head injury. His and Senegal‚Äôs ascent to the final four has come as little surprise. While Ivory Coast, Algeria, Ghana and Nigeria have fallen by the wayside, Senegal have overcome every obstacle put in their path so far, even though it hasn‚Äôt been pretty. They negotiated their group stage without conceding a goal, but won just once‚Äîthat 97th-minute winner against Zimbabwe‚Äîand were duly held 0-0 by both Guinea and Malawi. They similarly struggled to ignite against Cape Verde in the Second Round, before Mane broke the deadlock and Bamba Dieng finished off the contest later in the second half. Against Equatorial Guinea in the quarter-final, they may have conceded‚Äîand could have conceded more‚Äîbut offensively, they started to tick, with the late arrival of Ismaila Sarr from Watford opening up the opposition defence as the Teranga Lions ran out 3-1 winners. During the group stage, two early kick-offs‚Äîthey twice played in the sapping heat of 14h‚Äîcould explain their sluggish start, and their improved performances in the knockouts give the whiff of champions. Despite conceding, a defensive containing the likes of Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy, Bouna Sarr and Abdou Diallo is the strongest in the tournament, while the arrival of Sarr can open up Mane and give the Teranga Lions an extra dimension in attack. Senegal are certainly favourites to overcome Burkina Faso, fuelled by a desire to put a smile on the face of their embattled population back home, when the pair meet in Wednesday‚Äôs semi-final at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo, Yaounde. So, that would put Sadio Mane through to Sunday‚Äôs final at the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe‚Ä¶but will it be Mohamed Salah who joins him from the other half of the draw? Egypt, unlike Senegal, weren‚Äôt consistently tipped for a strong showing in Cameroon ahead of the tournament, and fears that a lack of midfield creativity might limit them were realised during a stodgy group-stage showing and, particularly, their opening loss to Nigeria. While the Super Eagles were ultimately dumped out at the first sign of trouble, however, the Pharaohs rode out the storm and have progressed to the final four, while enduring the hardest knockout run of any of the sides still standing. While their semi-final opponents Cameroon had to dispatch minnows Comoros and Gambia, Egypt had to last the full 120 minutes against both Ivory Coast and Morocco before seeing off the former on penalties and their North African rivals thanks to Trezeguet‚Äôs extra-time goal. It doesn‚Äôt quite make them favourites‚ÄîCameroon have momentum behind them, the fuel of home support, and a plethora of attackers in hot form‚Äîbut it demonstrates that Egypt, Africa‚Äôs masters of finding a way to win, have the kind of resourcefulness that few in the continent can match. Salah, like Mane, has sparkled intermittently at the tournament‚Äîand made some big contributions‚Äîwithout truly dominating games consistently. He generates more excitement among local supporters‚Äîat least until he‚Äôs due to come up against the hosts on Thursday‚Äîand both of the Liverpool stars have scored two and registered one assist so far this campaign. Salah just edges it, with his performance against Morocco‚Äîscoring the equaliser and then setting up Trezeguet‚Äôs winner‚Äîthe kind of superstar showing that underpins his standing as Africa‚Äôs top player in the planet today. Both have lost in the final before, Mane in 2019 and Salah two years before, and both are clearly desperate to right the wrongs of Afcons gone by. The only question is: will they have to go through each other to do it?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/is-afcon-2021-heading-towards-a-salah-vs-mane-final/blt608b9eaf3e121d0a,Ed Dove,d926a104-d453-4a9e-aa69-329de73b1eea

Why is Alphonso Davies not playing for Canada in World Cup 2022 qualifying?,"Canada and Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies was notably absent during Canada's victory over the United States Men's National Team on January 30, and he won't be featuring in his side's World Cup 2022 qualifier against El Salvador, either. So why is the left-back absent, and when will he be back playing again? GOAL takes a look. Davies will not be playing in Canada's World Cup 2022 qualifier against El Salvador as he is currently recovering from contracting Covid-19 earlier in the month.  Following Davies' positive test, Bayern Munich also announced a diagnosis¬†of ""mild myocarditis,"" which is an inflammation of the heart. Canada stated that Davies would not be involved in the fixtures against the USMNT on January 30 and the qualifier against El Salvador on February 2 to allow Davies to fully recover. Canada manager John Herdman stated that while he and his team would be disappointed by Davies' absence, they'd still remain focused and resilient. ""Firstly, we wish Alphonso the best of health and hope he recovers,"" Herdman told reporters.¬†""We can't deny that it's a big loss on a number of reasons. He's such an infectious personality when he's in the camp, and you miss him when he's not here. But we have to adapt, it's part of this story. ""We've been on this World Cup qualification journey since March of last year, and we've had a lot of ups and downs with players coming in and out, and we've responded and I think that's key to all this. There's a mentality in this group that these things are going to happen, and it's an opportunity now for someone else to respond and make sure that we stay on track to qualify for the World Cup."" Davies has been a pivotal figure in the Canada side during this qualification phase, having scored a goal and notched three assists ‚Äì while Canada registered three wins and four draws in the matches he's featured in. Nevertheless, Canada did register a 2-0 victory over the USMNT in a game that Davies was forced to sit out to go top of the Concacaf hexagonal qualification table.

Nagelsmann said at the time: ‚ÄúYesterday, during our follow-up examination that we do with every player that has had COVID-19, we detected signs of mild myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. ‚ÄúHe has stopped training for now, so he won't be available to us for the next weeks. ‚ÄúThis myocarditis isn't too dramatic based on the ultrasound, but more simply signs of an inflammation.

"Mane transfer is a 'real rocket' for Bundesliga after Lewandowski exit, says RB Leipzig's Orban","RB Leipzig defender Willi Orban¬†has told GOAL and SPOX that he believes Sadio Mane's arrival will be a big boost to the Bundesliga following the departure of Robert Lewandowski. The German top-flight lost its most prolific scorer this season when Lewandowski left to join Barcelona for a reported ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$50m) fee, while another key goal scorer in Borussia Dortmund hero Erling Haaland left for Manchester City.  Bayern have rejuvenated their attack in the summer transfer window, however, having brought in Senegal star Sadio Mane from Liverpool in a deal worth ‚Ç¨41m (¬£35m/$43m). Orban joked that he was worried the Bundesliga would be boring without Lewandowski and Haaland, but maintains Mane offers a real threat to Bayern's opponents. Asked about the toughest opponents he has faced, Orban told GOAL: ‚ÄúThere are quite a few. Lewandowski and Haaland have been formative strikers in recent years, it was never easy to defend against them, they are simply two exceptional players!  ""This year they are no longer there and I thought I'll be a bit bored this season until Sadio Mane was signed.  ""Seriously, there are already a lot of good guys in the league and with Mane a real rocket is coming our way and mine."" Leipzig finished fourth in the Bundesliga last season after recovering from a difficult start to the campaign under previous coach Jesse Marsch. The Saxony team are hoping for a stronger season in the coming term and Orban is confident they can compete with their direct rivals.  ""Dortmund and Bayern have strengthened themselves very well on the transfer market. It is important for us to continue to improve. That is primarily about consistency and we have to show that in every game,"" he added.  ""In general, I would I wish that the Bundesliga wouldn't be decided on matchday 30 and would get a little more exciting again.

‚ÄòThe worst mistake of my life‚Äô - USWNT legend Hope Solo pleads guilty to DWI,"USWNT legend Hope Solo has pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while impaired, with the former goalkeeper admitting that she has made the ‚Äúworst mistake of my life‚Äù. The 40-year-old, who saw her national team contract terminated in 2016, was arrested in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on March 31 and charged with driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest and misdemeanour child abuse. Police reported that Solo was found passed out behind the wheel of her vehicle with the engine running in the parking lot of a Walmart while her two children were in the car, with prosecutors claiming that she refused to take a sobriety test. It was later determined that she was three times the legal limit to be driving. Forsyth District Judge Victoria Roemer has issued Solo with a two-year suspended sentence and an active sentence of 30 days, which is considered to have been served as time has already been spent in a rehabilitation centre. Solo has also been ordered to pay a $2,500 fine after surrendering her license and will be required to undergo a substance abuse assessment before completing a recommended treatment programme. Solo remains the most-capped player in the history of the U.S. Women‚Äôs National Team after representing her country on 202 occasions ‚Äì with 153 wins and 102 clean sheets allowing her to collect two Olympic gold medals and a 2015 World Cup crown. She has been elected to the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame, with her induction being deferred until 2023, and has said on social media of tarnishing her reputation away from the pitch: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long road, but I‚Äôm slowly coming back from taking time off. ‚ÄúI pride myself in motherhood and what my husband and I have done day in and day out for over two years throughout the pandemic with two-year-old twins. ‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm proud of us, it was incredibly hard and I made a huge mistake.

Chelsea stage incredible FA Youth Cup comeback to beat Liverpool 4-3 after late three-goal deficit,"Chelsea's youngsters staged a remarkable comeback on Saturday to advance in the FA Youth Cup at the expense of Liverpool.  The Blues appeared to be heading out in the fifth round as they trailed by three goals with just 20 minutes left to play.  But they came charging back to win 4-3 and advance to the quarter-finals of the famous youth competition.  Playing at Kirkby, the Reds made a strong start to the tie when they took the lead through Luke Chambers.  Kaide Gordon and Oakley Cannonier were also on target to put the hosts 3-0 up midway through the second half.  Chelsea kept fighting, however, and pulled one back when Charlie Webster scored a deflected effort from distance.  Jude Soonsup-Bell then reduced the deficit to just one goal, and the Blues then profited from an unfortunate own goal to pull level.  Contrast in emotions at the end. Chelsea euphoric, Liverpool distraught. Remarkable game.#LFC üî¥ #CFC üîµ #FAYouthCup pic.twitter.com/YwwR1OxBHG Substitute Tudor Mendel Idowu then converted from a low cross, leaving the visitors in ecstasy while Liverpool's kids mourned their late collapse.  The contrast at the final whistle could hardly have been starker. As Liverpool‚Äôs players sunk to the floor, distraught, Chelsea‚Äôs let loose. The celebrations were wild, and why wouldn‚Äôt they be? What a comeback, what a win.  What a game. Liverpool will wonder what on earth happened in that last 25 minutes. They were cruising, three up thanks to three wonderful-worked, and clinically-finished, goals from captain Luke Chambers, wonderkid Kaide Gordon and top-scorer Oakley Cannonier. But from the moment Charlie Webster‚Äôs 20-yarder took a deflection past Harvey Davies, the whole scene changed. Suddenly the home side were tired, cramping up and looking edgy. They were forced into substitutions which weakened them, while Chelsea made changes that strengthened them. They got some luck too. Their opener was fortuitous and their equaliser came via an Isaac Mabaya clearance which smashed into Malik Mothersille and left Davies helpless. But when two substitutes, Silko Thomas and Tudor Mendell Idowu, combined for the winner in stoppage time, you could only admire their character and fight. Liverpool, on the other hand, will have only regrets. Their FA Youth Cup run is over, and it‚Äôll take them a few days before they work out how. Established in 1952, the FA Youth Cup is open to England's Under-18s team and runs alongside the senior FA Cup.

Marsch enjoys first win as Leeds manager as Gelhardt scores 94th minute goal in 2-1 victory vs Norwich,"Leeds secured their first win under new manager Jesse Marsch on Sunday thanks to a stoppage- time goal from Joe Gelhardt. The Elland Road side took the lead against Norwich early on, with Rodrigo opening the scoring inside the first 15 minutes of the match. The hosts looked set to see out a narrow win until the 91st minute when Kenny McLean struck to level the score, but Gelhardt popped up to seal the winner shortly afterwards. Marsch said after the game that his side were worthy of the win and created enough chances to have extended their lead before half-time.¬† He said: ""Obviously there's a lot of emotions in the game. I'd heard a lot about the magic of Elland Road and we felt that today. ""The crowd were fantastic and the performance brought them into the game. JOE GELHARDT WITH THE STOPPAGE TIME WINNER FOR LEEDS!

Some of our chances in the first half, we could have finished the game off earlier. ""We have to fight for everything. It will make us stronger and we will keep pushing. ""It was very frantic. The goal against us is avoidable. Most of the work we're doing is about video analysis and going through walkthroughs. ""We need more time together but this was a step in the right direction. On another day I think we're going to win this game more completely."" He added: ""I take it was a strong performance and we showed more what we want the game to look like. It will take more time still. We still have lots of work to do. ""I want to be positive with the lads and keep feeding them with the right information but we need to stick together and keep fighting until the end."" The result brings an end to a long losing streak for Leeds. They had lost six matches in a row in the Premier League, a run which culminated in the sacking of coach Marcelo Bielsa. Marsch came in to replace the Argentine, but Leeds lost their first two matches under the American. They dropped dangerously close to the relegation zone, but the three points collected on Sunday will provide a boost in their fight to avoid the drop.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/marsch-first-win-leeds-manager-gelhardt-scores-94th-minute/blt67cac064d36549b7,By Peter McVitie,9a5c1f2f-6357-4516-9c82-483f1b6c4f98
Perisic to seek Modric advice after becoming latest Croatia star to join Tottenham,"Ivan Perisic admits that he will be seeking advice from Luka Modric when it comes to life at Tottenham, with the experienced winger becoming the latest Croatian star to take on a new challenge in north London. The 33-year-old forward, who scored for his country in the 2018 World Cup final, has completed a switch to Spurs as a free agent after reaching the end of his contract at Serie A giants Inter. That move has allowed him to be reunited with former Nerazzurri boss Antonio Conte, while he is also following in the footsteps of some distinguished countrymen that have previously graced a famous Lilywhites jersey. Perisic claims to have kept an eye on goings-on at Tottenham for several years, with the presence of international colleagues helping to keep him interested. He has told Spurs‚Äô official website after signing a two-year contract with Premier League heavyweights: ‚ÄúI know Tottenham from 2008, 2009, 2010. ‚ÄúI followed (the team) because a lot of Croatian players played here.

He has said: ‚ÄúI think everything that they [supporters] expect and believe he will bring, they will get with him. ‚ÄúI must admit, for me, along with Luka, he is probably the biggest reason that the Croatian national team has had the success it has had because his goals, assists and his ability to make a difference in the final third is something that the team has relied on.

Pulisic wants more Chelsea chances after West Ham winner: 'I always want to be on the pitch',"Christian Pulisic has told Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel he ‚Äúalways wants to be on the pitch‚Äù after making an important contribution off the bench in the derby victory over West Ham. The United States international was given just 14 minutes of game time against the Hammers, but that was enough for him to grab a dramatic winner. Shortly after seeing Jorginho fluff his lines from the penalty spot, Pulisic pounced in the dying seconds to fire into the bottom corner and claim three important points. After proving his worth as a substitute against West Ham, Pulisic hopes he has done enough to convince his manager that he should be used from the start in upcoming fixtures. He told reporters : ‚ÄúIt was a massive goal. We had so much pressure on them for most of the game but we couldn‚Äôt get that breakthrough, so I am happy I was able to help out. ‚ÄúI always want to be on the pitch, to help my team and I am glad I got the opportunity today.

'I'd have taken Balotelli!' - Italy boss Mancini's mother criticises team selection after World Cup failure,"Roberto Mancini's mother has weighed in on Italy's failure to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, stating that she would have picked Mario Balotelli for this month's last-chance encounters. Less than a year after claiming success at Euro 2020, the reigning European Champions will miss out on a second successive World Cup after they were downed 1-0 by North Macedonia on Friday. The Azzurri failed to score from 32 shots, leaving manager Mancini to face an uncertain future - and now his mother Marianna Puolo has weighed in, saying that she would have called upon the fiery forward who was omitted from the final squad. ‚ÄúYesterday could‚Äôve gone better, but this is football, sometimes things go right and sometimes things go wrong,"" Puolo told Radiouno. ""We had the match in our hands but the attack wasn‚Äôt great. ‚ÄúI would have called up Balotelli, because he has incredible physical strength and in front of the goal nobody can stop him. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, mistakes like Jorginho‚Äôs cost us.

Puolo still feels that her son's squad has the capacity to challenge down the line however, though she made sure to get a pointed dig in at England, who Italy edged in the Euro 2020 final last summer. ""Macedonia only had one shot, maybe Donnarumma could‚Äôve saved it but it‚Äôs useless to talk about it now.

Hazard quizzed on following Bale to MLS as Belgian forward fights for a future at Real Madrid,"Eden Hazard says he is not ready for a move to MLS just yet, as he seeks to prove his worth during a difficult spell at Real Madrid, but the Belgian is ruling nothing out when it comes to future windows of opportunity. At the age of 31, the former Chelsea star still has two years left to run on his contract at Santiago Bernabeu and has no intention of walking away from that agreement. He has just seen Gareth Bale head to America at LAFC after severing ties with La Liga heavyweights, but another forward that has struggled to win over a demanding fan base in the Spanish capital insists that any plans of making his own move across the Atlantic remain very much on hold for now. The Belgium international, who remains a talismanic presence for his country in World Cup year, has told ESPN when asked if an American adventure will form part of his future: ‚ÄúI don't think about that that much. Now, I'm just focused on this season. ‚ÄúI still have a contract for two more years. And then we'll see in two years.

Quizzed on why he has stayed put, Hazard said: ‚ÄúI want to show people that I can play for this club. That's it. That's my only reason. ‚ÄúIt's been a few seasons that I've not been playing that much, so for me, it's like the [first] full one now with this club. I just want to show what I can do on the pitch.

"Espanyol vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona travel to the RCDE stadium on Sunday for the Catalan derby in La Liga against Espanyol. Xavi Hernandez's side come into the game following an impressive 4-2 defeat of champions Atletico Madrid last weekend with the Blaugrana extending their unbeaten league run to seven matches. Espanyol, meanwhile, are yet to win a league game in 2022, enduring three defeats and a draw in their four La Liga clashes so far this year. Xavi's first match in charge of Barca came against Espanyol back in November at Camp Nou where the visitors spurned a number of extremely clear chances to score, in a match which ended 1-0 to the hosts. Barcelona can be backed at 3/4 (1.75) with bet365 to claim another win, while Vicente Moreno's Espanyol are available at 4/1 (5.00) to record what would be their first derby win at home in the league since 2007. The draw is on offer at 13/5 (3.60). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made his Barcelona debut off the bench last weekend and the former Arsenal striker is the shortest priced player to score first at 10/3 (4.33). Ferran Torres is offered at 9/2 (5.50), the same price as Luuk De Jong, while Espanyol's Raul De Tomas, the joint top-scoring Spaniard in La Liga, is available at 11/2 (6.50). Signs of improvement are beginning to be seen from Barcelona and, having strengthened the squad in the transfer window, the Blaugrana are expected to continue to climb up the table. Last weekend's win over Atletico saw them move into a Champions League spot, and Barca's impressive firepower should help them win plenty of matches between now and the end of the season. However, they remain vulnerable defensively with the side keeping just two clean sheets in their last 13 competitive fixtures, and Espanyol will be confident of finding the back of the net on Sunday. Los Pericos really should have scored at Camp Nou, with Raul De Tomas hitting the woodwork and Landry Dimata missing from just a few yards out, and Espanyol are a side who have been finding the back of the net consistently this term. Indeed, since their blank in the derby back in November, Espanyol have netted in 12 of their subsequent 13 matches and backing them to do so once more makes sense. Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals looks like a promising selection for this game and is offered at the healthy looking price of 11/10 (2.10). You can watch La Liga live on the go with your iPhone, iPad or Android device through your bet365 account. All you need is a funded account or to have placed a bet in the last 24 hours to qualify.

Chelsea takeover shortlist: Boehly & Broughton among successful 'preferred bidders',"Chelsea have informed the successful potential future owners of the club that they have progressed to the next round of the takeover process, rejecting a whole host of other bidders. The sale of the Blues, handled by Raine Group, looks to be heading into the final stages with at least a quartet of options still in the mix, including the consortium headed up by Los Angeles Dodgers owner Todd Boehly with features Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and British entrepreneur Jonathan Goldstein. Atalanta part-owner Stephen Pagliuca is also through to the shortlist stage, along with the bid from Harris Blizter Sports & Entertainment, part owners of Crystal Palace, with backing from ex-Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton and World Athletics president Lord Sebastian Coe, alongside the offer from unpopular Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family. Nick Candy's offer, which had the ¬£1 billion ($1.3bn)¬†backing of a South Korean group, and Gianluca Vialli's Tifosy Capital and Advisory,¬†is now out of the running. Meanwhile, the status of¬†Centricus, the London-based global investment firm who had bid close to ¬£3 billion ($4bn), is not yet confirmed. As first revealed by GOAL, the Saudi Media Group are out of contention despite having had a 'competitive bid'. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson is also said to be out of the running, while there were thought to be other bids that didn't go public about their intention to buy Chelsea FC.  Despite failing in the process, some of the interested parties are thought to be ready to join the negotiations through the preferred bidders. Saudi Media Group and Catalina Kim of C&P Sports Group, who leads the Korean influence around Candy, are both ready to offer their further backing to the successful consortiums.  The successful bids will be looked over in far greater detail and include background checks on everyone involved in the process and where their money comes from.  The idea is to have a clear view and do 'due diligence' on the potential future owners of Chelsea FC.  Although there's a desire to complete the process at rapid speed, it could still take some time to choose a potential owner.  Chelsea's board, which features Marina Granovskaia, Bruce Buck, Eugene Tenenbaum and David Barnard, will ultimately decide who owns the club in the future.  Raine Group are not said to be making the choice and are simply advising. Meanwhile, the UK Government are involved but only to ensure that no money goes to sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich, with the proceeds of the sale to go into a frozen account or to charity.  The Blues had hoped to have a new owner before their next match against Brentford after the international break but that's highly unlikely now.  The process needs to be completed before May 31 or it could cause a significant negative impact on the finances of the west Londoners.

Fabio Chiarodia: The teenage Italian defender breaking records in Germany,"In Bundesliga history, only two clubs have ever won more points than Werder Bremen: Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. They also share the record for the most seasons played in the German top flight alongside Bayern and yet, in 2021-22, they find themselves playing in the second tier following their relegation last season. As such, there is a rebuild taking place at Weserstadion, with the club's academy getting particular attention in the hope of creating a new generation of homegrown stars. That was very much in evidence in December, when the club set a new record for its youngest ever player as they aimed to hold on for a 3-2 win over Jahn Regensburg. Deep into stoppage time, centre-back Fabio Chiarodia was introduced off the bench for his debut, trusted by his manager Ole Werner despite being just 16 years and 188 days old at the time. Though he only managed a couple of touches of the ball in the Bavarian snow before the final whistle blew, Chiarodia's appearance was the latest step on a journey that has long seen him marked out as a talent of some repute. Nicknamed 'Das Kuken (The Chick)' by his team-mates, he has trained with the Werder first-team squad since pre-season, while elite European clubs are reported to be tracking his progress, including Juventus and Chelsea. ‚Ñùùïñùïûùïñùïûùïìùïñùï£ ùï•ùïôùïñ ùïüùïíùïûùïñ1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ years6Ô∏è‚É£ months5Ô∏è‚É£ daysCongratulations on becoming the youngest-ever player to make their #Werder debut, Fabio #Chiarodia! üíö pic.twitter.com/kzwoyB7i0T It is all a dream come true for Chiarodia, who was born just 50 kilometres west of Bremen in Oldenburg ‚Äì 12 years after his parents took the decision to move from the Italian town of Cinto Caomaggiore, near Venice, to Lower Saxony. Chiarodia's father, Ivano, now works in a town-centre ice cream shop with his brother-in-law, Roberto, but his youngest son has always been destined to play football for a living, after being plucked from the Oldenburg youth teams by Werder at the age of nine. ""My uncle has always been a big Werder fan, as have I,"" Chiarodia told Werder's official website. ""I often went to the Weserstadion when I was little. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""When I joined the academy, I cried tears of joy."" Straight away, he was marked out for his maturity, and the teenager has captained Werder's various age-group sides throughout his ascension to the senior ranks. Though naturally left-footed, he is comfortable with either foot, showing a calmness in possession that more and more modern-day coaches are keen to see from defenders. Comfortable when facing one-on-one situations, he has also developed physically to stand at 6'1'' (186cm), meaning he does not look out of place around those much older than him. He signed his first professional contract in October 2021 and the first team have worked hard to integrate him into the senior squad. ""When I entered the locker room for the first time and introduced myself, someone asked me where I came from,"" Chiarodia explained.  ""I answered 'Italy', and someone started singing Italian songs, since we had just won the European Championship!"" Former Borussia Dortmund defender Omer Toprak has played a key role in helping Chiarodia, with the youngster adding: ""In the first weeks with the first team, I was always silent, I didn't speak to anyone. If someone asked me questions, I went cold. ""I was very nervous, and it was he [Toprak] who let me ease into it. He helped me a lot ."" Though Chiarodia has played a number of friendlies for the senior side, his debut remains his only competitive outing to date, with the club keen to build up his minutes with the Under-19s while allowing him to train with the first team. Their plan is likely to involve him being promoted to the senior ranks on a full-time basis for the 2022-23 campaign. Doing so would certainly help when it comes to tying him down to a new contract, with his current deal having entered its final 18 months. ""Fabio is one of the most talented players in Europe, who is already in the notebooks of top international clubs,"" Werder sporting director, Frank Baumann, told Kicker. Juve would certainly love to have a potential future star of the Italy national team in their ranks, with Chiarodia having opted to represent the Azzurri, despite having been called-up to the Germany U15s squad in the past. The feeling in Italy, as well as in Bremen, is that 'The Chick' will soon be a name on everyone's lips.  Werder just hope he can help re-establish them among Bundesliga's best first.

'Man Utd hard to enjoy' - Shaw admits feeling best with England national team amid 'not good enough' club season,"Luke Shaw has admitted that he has struggled to enjoy himself during a tough season for Manchester United.  The Red Devils are out of the Champions League and face an uphill battle to clinch qualification for next year's competition, having been forced to change their manager midway through the term.  Their travails are in stark contrast to Shaw's experiences with England, who are gearing up for the World Cup this year after an almost flawless qualifying campaign.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always important to feel like you‚Äôre wanted and I think especially here I always feel that,"" Shaw told Sky Sports after England's 2-1 victory over Switzerland on Saturday, where he netted just before half-time to equalise for the Three Lions.  ""I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt at United but here, the way things are, I feel wanted and I enjoy my football. And I think a big part of football is the enjoyment. ‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs hard to enjoy when we‚Äôre losing and we‚Äôre not playing well at club level and we have to face that.  ""This season it‚Äôs not been good enough at all so it‚Äôs hard to enjoy. We know we‚Äôve got a lot to improve at the club but obviously right now we‚Äôre here with England so I‚Äôm focusing on that."" Shaw, 26, made his England debut back in 2014 and has gone on to make 20 appearances for the nation, scoring on two occasions.  In spite of United's struggles the full-back has enjoyed a welcome return to form at Old Trafford recently, though he was forced to sit out their defeats to Manchester City and Atletico Madrid due to a bout of Covid-19.

"Bayern starlet Musiala 'doesn't play enough for his qualities', admits Nagelsmann","Julian Nagelsmann has admitted Bayern Munich starlet Jamal Musiala ""doesn't play enough for his qualities"".  Musiala joined Bayern's ranks in 2019 and quickly graduated to the senior squad, becoming the youngest player to feature in the Bundesliga for the club in the process. The midfielder has helped the German giants win five trophies, but hasn't played as much as he would have liked so far this season with Nagelsmann conceding strong competition for places is limiting his contribution. Musiala has only started eight Bundesliga games in 2021-22, including Bayern's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. The 19-year-old played 82 minutes at Deutsche Bank Park and impressed with his creativity, earning special praise from his manager. ""He's a very good player who actually doesn't play enough for his qualities due to the competitive situation we have,"" Nagelsmann said post-match. ""I was very satisfied, I would have given him a goal.¬†He was sure of the ball and, above all, very hard-working.¬†He's hard to get hold of, he twists out of situations like a snake and always gets his feet on the ball."" Musiala has appeared in 66 games for Bayern to date, scoring 13 goals and providing six assists.

Duisburg vs Osnabruck game in Germany abandoned following racist abuse from the stands,"Duisburg's game with Osnabruck in the German third tier was abandoned with just over 30 minutes played after match officials stopped the game following an apparent racist incident within the stands. The 3.Liga encounter was originally suspended midway through the first half by the referee following abusive comments aimed from the crowd at Schauinsland-Reisen-Arena towards an unspecified player. Though both teams held subsequent discussions about the resumption of the game, news came through three-quarters of an hour after the incident that the match would not restart.

"Burkina Faso vs Senegal: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Senegal hope to make it to a second consecutive Africa Cup of Nations final on Wednesday when they face Burkina Faso in the last four. The 2019 runners-up have looked strong in the competition so far and take on a side that managed to scrape through to the semi-finals with a narrow win against Tunisia in the previous round. At 4/5 (1.8) with bet365, Senegal are favourites to win the match, while Burkina Faso are available at 19/4 (5.75) You can also back the clash to finish a draw at 19/10 (2.9). Sadio Mane, who has scored twice already in the competition, is available at 3/1 (4.00) to be the first goalscorer in the match, while his team-mate Mame Thiam is 5/1 (6.00). Burkina Faso forward Abdoul Tapsoba, meanwhile, is offered at 10/1 (11.00). Burkina Faso have looked defensively strong in the competition, with Cameroon the only team to put more than one goal beyond them so far. But they will line up without Dango Ouattara, who scored the winning goal against Tunisia after setting up the important opener against Gabon in the previous round. The forward is suspended following the red card he received against Tunisia. Senegal have hit top form in the knockout stages with convincing wins against Cape Verde and Equatorial Guinea. They have no fresh injury or suspensions to worry about and have considerable firepower heading into the crucial clash, with the likes of Sadio Mane and Bamba Dieng raring to go. Both teams not to score is priced at 4/9 (1.44) which looks like a wise option given Senegal have looked strong defensively while Burkina Faso have had difficulty finding the net.

'Thanks for having me guys' - Lyon and USWNT star Macario posts sarcastic message to UEFA after Team of the Season snub,"Lyon star Catarina Macario has hit out at UEFA for leaving her out of this season's Champions League Team of the Year. The U.S. women's national team star played a crucial role this season as Lyon went on to claim the European title for the eighth time in their history.

Arsenal brutally troll Tottenham with 'empty trophy cabinet' online shop message,"Arsenal have had a dig at Tottenham's lack of recent success  - via the unusual route of their online shop. The Gunners' north London rivals have had a hard time winning any trophies in recent years, last lifting the League Cup in 2008. It has been almost 31 years since they last won the FA Cup and they have not been crowned champions of England since they won the First Division in 1961. Arsenal have poked some fun at their local foes by displaying a cheeky message when fans browse their shop. Any attempt to checkout without adding anything to the shopping cart is met with a message that reads: ""Your basket is as empty as Tottenham's trophy cabinet."" Arsenal have said that the message had not been officially approved to appear on their site and would be removed. An official statement from the club read: ""This was posted to the site in error without appropriate checks and approvals and is being removed as quickly as possible."" While Arsenal have had a few rough years recently, they have been much more successful than Spurs. The Gunners have won the English top-flight 13 times, though the most recent occasion was in 2004.  They have had more success in the FA Cup recently, winning it in 2020 for the 14th time to make them the competition's most successful team.

He needs help from above after another shambolic transfer window that shuts on September 1.  His top target, Frenkie de Jong, is still to arrive ‚Äì and humiliating defeats to Brighton and Brentford have proved his current squad can‚Äôt compete.  In that sense, this early season pain may help his cause if the Glazer family and chief executive Richard Arnold are sufficiently alarmed to make desperately-needed funds available. Bottom of the Premier League for the first time bottom for 30 years ‚Äì Ten Hag is the first United manager since John Chapman in 1921 to lose his opening two games in charge.

"Leicester City‚Äôs Daka closes in on Vardy record, Iwobi grabs assist in vital Everton victory","Zambia international Patson Daka has closed in on a Jamie Vardy record after scoring in their 2-1 loss to Everton at the King Power Stadium on Sunday. All five of Daka‚Äôs Premier League goals for the Foxes have come at the King Power Stadium, four of which have come in starts. Only Vardy (six) has netted more often at home for the club in the top-flight in 2021-22. Meanwhile, after Vitalii Mykolenko had scored ‚Äì with an assist from Alex Iwobi - the opener for the Toffees in the sixth minute, Daka equalised in the 11th minute before the visitors got the winning goal in the 30th minute through Mason Holgate. Mykolenko's superb finish from Iwobi's cross after six minutes saw the visitors break the deadlock. Mykolenko is now the very first Ukrainian to score a Premier League goal for Everton, the 39th¬†different nationality to find the net in the competition for the Toffees, and the sixth most of all clubs. Daka took advantage of Yerry Mina's weak header back to Jordan Pickford to draw the Foxes level. Later on, Holgate scored the second goal for Frank Lampard‚Äôs side when he reacted quickly to slot the ball home after Kasper Schmeichel had initially kept out Richarlison's header from a corner. Holgate‚Äôs winner for Everton was his second Premier League goal in his last five matches, one more than he‚Äôd managed across his other 109 top-flight appearances beforehand. The win means Iwobi and his teammates took a giant step towards extending Everton‚Äôs unbroken 68-year Premier League residence¬†and have now moved out of the bottom three. The loss at home has extended Leicester's winless Premier League run to five games. Before today, the Foxes had won eight of their last nine league matches against sides starting the day inside the relegation zone (D1), with this defeat was their first against one of those sides since November 2020 against Fulham, which was also a 2-1 defeat at home. Mali‚Äôs Abdoulaye Doucoure, featured as Everton won an away top-flight match for the first time in 15 games since besting Brighton back in August in what was their third game of the season.

AGF Aarhus insist Wilshere signing is not a 'publicity stunt' as former Arsenal star steps outside of his 'comfort zone',"AGF Aarhus have denied that they have signed former Arsenal man Jack Wilshere as a publicity stunt, insisting he has plenty to offer still.  The Englishman has been without a club since being released by Bournemouth in July 2021 but has now moved to Denmark to resume his career. Wilshere himself also revealed that a former England manager played at least a small part in his decision to move to Denmark. Speaking to Sky Sports, Wilshere said: ""It all happened really quick. I had a conversation with one of the coaches, David Reddington. He explained to me about the club, how good it is and how much I'd enjoy it. ""He worked with someone I worked with closely, Roy Hodgson, who I enjoyed working with. I knew Dave would have a similar way of doing things. Then I spoke with the head coach and really liked what they were saying. ""I always said that in my career I wanted to try something different. I think now was the right time to step out of my comfort zone, step out of England and try something different."" Wilshere added: ""I'm not fully match fit because I've not played, and the only way to get match fit is to play matches. But what I would say is I've been training for a long period of time with good players. ""I'm ready to play, I'm ready to be selected by the manager and I'm looking forward to it. As a footballer the best thing is playing games."" AGF boss David Nielsen said: ""This is not a publicity stunt. [Wilshere] is a skilled football player who we think can help us, and we think we can help him. We have done this to make our team better. ""We will make sure that he feels like a good part of the squad. ""Denmark has a good reputation. It is a place where people want to live. He has lived in London, and now he will be able to live in Aarhus. It is an even better place to live!"" Wilshere was allowed to leave Arsenal on a loan spell to Bournemouth back in 2016 before subsequently joining West Ham on a free transfer in 2018. In 2020, the midfielder was released by the London club and only returned to Bournemouth in 2021, having been signed as a free agent that time around.

"Barcelona smash own women's attendance world record as 91,648 fans attend Wolfsburg win","Barcelona have made women's football history once more after the Blaugrana broke the world attendance record for the second time this year - taking their own spot at the top of the history books in the process - with their Champions League rout of Wolfsburg. A rampant performance from the Blaugrana saw them emerge 5-1 victors over their visitors at Camp Nou, mere weeks after the team broke a two-decade-plus record to deliver the highest crowd figure for a women's football fixture this century, with 91,553 in attendance. That game - a Clasico with local rivals Real Madrid - looked likely to stand the test of time for the near future, but mere weeks later, the club have topped themselves with another eye-watering gate figure. Barcelona announced a new world record attendance of 91, 648 for their match aaginst Wolfsburg on Friday, with just shy of a hundred additional supporters more than the number posted against Madrid. It, by default, also takes the records for the most-attended club football game in women's football, as well as fixture in Europe. It also trumps the figures set by Barcelona's men's team this season, in both their own Clasico with Madrid (86,422) and their best European attendance of the campaign, against Eintracht Frankfurt earlier this month (79,468). Wolfsburg forward Tabea Wassmuth paid tribute to the vast crowd crammed into Camp Nou, but admitted her side needed to better themselves after a frustrating result.

How Iwobi and Doucoure inspired Everton against Crystal Palace,"Alex Iwobi and Abdoulaye Doucoure stressed their importance to Everton in Thursday‚Äôs 3-2 comeback Premier League win over Crystal Palace. The Nigeria and Mali internationals delivered eye-catching displays as the Toffees sealed English top-flight survival. Although Frank Lampard‚Äôs men made a false start at Goodison Park, they made sure that the Eagles returned home empty-handed. After 21 minutes, Jean-Philippe Mateta fired the visitors ahead while Jordan Ayew doubled the advantage nine minutes before the half-time break. Despite looking destined for defeat, Michael Keane reduced the deficit for Everton six minutes before the hour mark, before Richarlison restored parity for the hosts in the 75th minute. Demarai Gray set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the winner with five minutes left on the clock to send the home fans into wild jubilation.¬† Iwobi played from start to finish and statistics showed that he impressed against Patrick Vieira‚Äôs Eagles.¬† The former Arsenal man recorded one shot, one cross, 77 touches, and 48 passes with a passing accuracy of 79.2 per cent.¬† Also, he completed three dribbles, contributed one tackle, and one interception while he was fouled on three occasions. For Doucoure, he accounted for one key pass, 51 passes and a passing accuracy of 84.3 per cent.¬† Defensively, he made five total tackles and one interception.¬† He was a cautioned by referee Anthony Taylor in the 82nd minute, notwithstanding, he was a thorn in the flesh of Crystal Palace's attacking players. ""It is one of the greatest moments of my footballing life and career,"" Lampard told¬†BBC Sport¬†after the full-time whistle. ""I have been very fortunate to have amazing times, especially at Chelsea as a player and a coach. ""But when you feel the feelings and desperation of what relegation brings to the table, it is different.  ""You need to dig in.

Benzema: I wasn't Ronaldo's deputy at Real Madrid,"Real Madrid star Karim Benzema has insisted that he did not play the role of Cristiano Ronaldo's deputy during their time together at the Spanish club. The talented pair were instrumental in the success that Madrid enjoyed over the past decade but there were many who were of the opinion that Ronaldo was the main star, with Benzema being second in command. Indeed, the pair won numerous trophies together and despite Ronaldo having scored more times than Benzema, the Frenchman has dismissed the suggestion that he played a more superior role. Benzema told France Football: ""It (the role Benzema played alongside Ronaldo) wasn't a deputy, it wasn't that. I didn't say to myself: 'Ah, I have to give him the ball all the time'. I was playing well but he was scoring twice [each game]. It's the truth, you can't do anything about it.  ""Since he left for Juve, I took over in my own way and it's going well. I don't play like Cristiano Ronaldo, and he doesn't play like Karim Benzema.  ""He didn't stop me from being the best version of myself. We won a lot of games, I had a lot of fun. To think like that is to be too individual. I won it all with him. The Champions League, many championships, we scored I don't know how many goals, we were part of the magic trio with [Gareth] Bale, there were a lot of very good moments and I don't see any bad ones."" Both Ronaldo and Benzema arrived in Madrid in the summer of 2009 and have collectively scored a remarkable 752 goals, though the latter has spent more time in Spain. The former Juventus man was responsible for a staggering 450 goals in just 438 matches, while Benzema has netted 302 times so far, in his 585 games for the club. The Frenchman, meanwhile, netted 192 times during the period 2009 to 2018, when both players were on Madrid's books, meaning that the total goals Benzema and Ronaldo managed between them during their time together at the club was 642. Ronaldo and Benzema won the Champions League four times together, with the former's last game for the Spanish club coming in the final win over Liverpool back in 2018.  The duo also won La Liga, the Spanish Cup, and the Spanish Super Cup twice each, along with the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup three times each. Benzema has since won an additional La Liga, Spanish Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup. Benzema has been in fine form this season and is proving instrumental in Real Madrid's title charge, netting 23 goals in 26 appearances across all competitions. His numbers have undoubtedly improved since Ronaldo's departure and he has become an experienced leader in the Madrid dressing room. Ronaldo, meanwhile, is Manchester United's top scorer since returning to the club from Juventus in 2021. The Portuguese has scored 14 goals in 21 games in all competitions, and has admitted that he is looking to continue playing until he's at least 42 years old.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/karim-benzema-cristiano-ronaldo-deputy-real-madrid/blt5df82668575c76ec,Marwan Harraz,b4c1ed62-b008-4bfc-ba0d-a2970955b8ca

Rangnick has since managed to steady the ship, reigniting the Red Devils' hopes of a top-four Premier League finish, but will be moving into an advisory role at the end of the season. A permanent replacement for Solskjaer is still being sought, and Ten Hag has been reported as one of the leading candidates for the role. Rangnick is not aware of any discussions with the Dutchman taking place, but ranks him among the elite coaches in the business. ""I don't know him to start with as a person, but I've seen how Ajax have developed since he's been there,"" the United chief has told Sky Sports. ""I know about the work he did while he was at Bayern Munich and it's obvious he's one of the top coaches in Europe but there are a few others. ""We've not spoken about any new manager so far and therefore we've not spoken about him."" Rangnick was speaking ahead of the Red Devils' crucial derby clash with Manchester City on Sunday, and went on to reveal that he already has a preferred option in mind to fill his spot in the dugout. ""So far, we've not spoken about that,"" he said. ""Not with [football director] John Murtough or anyone else, we've not spoken about this topic over the last weeks and months since I've been here. I know my opinion but so far we've not spoken about that so it's all I can tell you."" Ten Hag began his coaching career with the Go Ahead Eagles in 2012, where he spent one year before taking over Bayern Munich II. The 52-year-old moved to Twente after leaving Germany and guided the club to a fourth-placed Eredivisie finish in 2016-17, attracting attention from Ajax in the process. Ten Hag was handed an initial two-and-a-half-year contract at Johan Cruyff Arena, and has seen that agreement extended after delivering four domestic trophies, including two Eredivisie titles. Ajax are on course to retain the trophy this season and still going strong in the Champions League, but Ten Hag has entered the last 18 months of his contract and United could yet come calling in the summer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/next-man-utd-manager-rangnick-ajax-ten-hag-best-coaches/blt7fb27de0f8ad3c94,James Westwood,527b74a1-0c68-4caf-8ada-2a45683c9b55
Watch: Dembele booed & whistled by Barcelona fans in first Camp Nou outing of 2022 as they ignore Xavi's plea,"Ousmane Dembele was whistled by Barcelona fans in his first Camp Nou outing of 2022 as they ignored Xavi's pre-match pleas. Dembele had spent over a month on the sidelines amid a turbulent January transfer saga that saw Barca look to cash in on the Frenchman before he becomes a free agent at the end of the season. Xavi drafted Dembele back into his squad for a 2-2 La Liga draw with Espanyol last weekend and he made another substitute appearance in the Europa League against Napoli on Thursday night, but did not receive a warm reception from the Blaugrana faithful.

Xavi had publically called on supporters to get behind the 24-year-old for the remainder of the season and was disappointed that his appeal fell on deaf ears. The Barca boss did, however, feel that Dembele had won the crowd around by the end of the game, as he told reporters after the final whistle: ‚ÄúThe public has ignored me, it is sovereign and it decides. ‚ÄúIn the end, he has transformed it to applause when he has generated things and dribbled. ‚ÄúHe has a lot of professionalism.

Juventus target three summer signings as Allegri makes recruitment push after disappointing season,"Juventus are aiming to sign players in three key positions this summer as they look to recover from another disappointing season, GOAL can confirm. The Turin giants are fourth in Serie A and eight points behind leaders AC Milan, while they crashed out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage with a home loss to Villarreal. The Bianconeri's only realistic chance of silverware this season is the Coppa Italia, having reached the semi-final of the tournament. Juventus finished fourth in the Italian top-flight last season and a second consecutive disappointing season has left the club feeling they require substantial investment in the squad to bounce back. GOAL can reveal that the club have discussed their plans for the summer transfer window and have come up with three areas in which they need to improve. Their main priorities are signing a new left-back, a physical midfielder who can score goals and a good replacement for Paulo Dybala. Dybala will leave the club as a free agent when his contract expires and the Serie A giants hope to bring in a winger who can strengthen the squad. The club made a significant improvement to the attack in January when they brought in Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina, but they acknowledge that they must improve in other areas, too. As well as new players coming in, Juve are also looking to clarify the future of some of their current players. While Dybala is set for the exit door, there are still some players nearing the end if their contracts who could be convinced to stay. Juan¬†Cuadrado's deal is running out, but he has said that he wants to stay at the club. Juventus still need to work out the details of his next contract, though, and nothing is guaranteed so far.¬† Goalkeeper Mattia Perin has also decided he would like to remain in Turin rather than leave this summer. Full-back Mattia De Sciglio seems to be the one closest to signing an extension as the next round of talks is expected to result in a full agreement over a new deal.¬† Federico Bernardeschi is still a big uncertainty, however, as there is currently no news over him committing his future to the club.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-target-three-summer-signings-as-allegri-makes/bltfd01a64b744687ef,Romeo Agresti,8315fc54-8eb2-4637-9fc2-54e40f3c9c74
"Atletico won't make transfer bid for Ronaldo, president Cerezo hints","Cristiano Ronaldo's pursuit of a new club is set to get stretched after Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo hinted that the Spanish outfit might not be able to land the Portuguese superstar. Ronaldo is adamant to leave Manchester United in search of Champions League football and Atletico were being touted as one of the possible destinations.  However, the Spanish club does not have the wage room to accommodate Ronaldo as they are struggling to balance their books to comply with the regulations of La Liga.  The club president was present at the team dinner at the Jose Mar√≠a de Segovia restaurant in Madrid where he addressed the question about Ronaldo's link with Atleti.  When asked if the Rojiblancos can sign the forward he said: ""You have to ask me more difficult questions.¬†To easy questions, simple answers.¬†It is considered answered."" Although he did not specifically mention that Atletico are not in the race, he dropped enough hints to make it clear that Ronaldo is not in their plans.  ""We are here for dinner, an early season dinner, with a wonderful squad, sensational players and a fantastic manager,"" he added.¬†""We have everything, what more can we ask for?""

He has been¬†linked with Roma¬†and Napoli in Italy, but they are not the favourites to lift the Champions League trophy.

Boost for Man City in Champions League clash with Real Madrid as Ancelotti reveals Alaba and Casemiro doubts,"Carlo Ancelotti says that both David Alaba and Casemiro could miss Real Madrid's Champions League semi-final against Manchester City as the Spanish giants could be without two key pieces of their spine against Pep Guardiola's side. The two are dealing with muscular problems and, while both were included in Real Madrid' traveling squad, there is still serious doubt about their availability for Tuesday's match. Ancelotti will be able to call upon fullback Ferland Mendy, who has returned to full training, but the results of Monday's training will determine the availability of Casemiro and Alaba at the Etihad.  ""From what we saw yesterday in training, we have some doubts about Alaba and some more doubts about Casemiro,"" the manager said at his pre-match press conference. ""Training will tell us more. We have more confidence with Alaba with Casemiro."" The Spanish giants are widely seen as underdogs against Manchester City, although that is something that Real Madrid has been dealing with in this Champions League run. Madrid were not favoured to take down Chelsea in the quarter-final round, but were able to hold onto an aggregate victory thanks to a 3-1 first leg triumph. Now, they're set to face the potential Premier League champions in Man City, but Ancelotti says that a club the size of Real Madrid isn't phased. ""I remember what was said.¬†It was what the press and public opinion thought,"" Ancelotti said.  ""There are two teams in the semi-finals that nobody thought could make it, one Villarreal and the other us, over teams that were favorites like PSG or City."" He added: ""I think there is no different pressure. Both teams have the same pressure. For Real Madrid it is not a success to reach the semi-final, it is a success to reach the final.  ""The goal is to win the final. Real Madrid normally has a higher percentage of options to win the final.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/boost-for-man-city-in-champions-league-clash-with-real-madrid-as-/bltb3d86cb792ad6fe5,Ryan Tolmich,e45b04d8-a3d0-4cf6-8365-5aa697cd6359
Why Eriksen to Spurs should be a no-brainer for Conte,"With each passing game it becomes more likely that Christian Eriksen will not be a Brentford player next season. Perhaps that is not surprising ‚Äì his talent was always above mid-table Premier League level ‚Äì yet nobody anticipated his spell under Thomas Frank going quite this well. Brentford have won all five of the matches in which Eriksen has started, winning 38 percent of their entire points tally for the 2021-22 Premier League season in the process. Eriksen has scored a goal and assisted two more, although his contribution goes way beyond those numbers. Eriksen, in fact, looks reborn, not just seizing the moment but playing in a subtly new way, taking on a different position and a more central role at Brentford to reflect his status within the club. Inevitably, this spell of form has led to rumours of Eriksen returning to Tottenham Hotspur ‚Äì where he would receive a hero's welcome despite a difficult end to his time in North London ‚Äì and reuniting with Antonio Conte, under whom he won the Serie A title at Inter last season. On paper, it is a perfect match; the right place for Eriksen to slip in seamlessly ahead of the World Cup this winter. And Conte already stated back in February that ""it would be good for me to have him again"", while a high-profile free transfer is bound to go down well with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy. However, it is not so clear whether there is space for Eriksen in Conte's 3-4-3 at Spurs, or if he would be happy as a squad member after being the top dog at Brentford. Tactically speaking, Eriksen looks to be a good fit, especially now he is excelling in a deeper midfield role at Brentford. Unlike during his time at Spurs or at Inter, Eriksen is no longer spending so much time in the final third. Instead, he tends to find himself as the deepest of Frank's midfield three, collecting the ball from a centre-back to play a line-splitting pass into the forwards. Acting as the side's lynchpin from within a more conservative setup than he has been used to, Eriksen is enjoying seeing more of the ball, taking advantage of being the central figure in a team who generally do not hold the majority of possession (44.6 per cent average across those five wins). Eriksen's press resistance from deep is helping Brentford work through a territorially-dominant opponent, and only once they have worked into the final third does he begin to roam into No.10 positions, linking neatly with Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney. Christian Eriksen's smile after scoring his first goal back in the Premier League üíõ pic.twitter.com/0D460gLyJX This just happens to be exactly what Spurs are lacking under Conte, who bucks the trend among top managers by deploying a midblock, meaning Tottenham often regain possession ‚Äì and look to build vertically through the lines ‚Äì from the same areas as Brentford. Throughout Conte's tenure so far Tottenham have struggled to create momentum in stodgy first halves, only to improve in the second once instructed by the manager to start hitting longer passes up to Harry Kane as he drops off the front, ready to find runners Son Heung-min and Dejan Kulusevski. Although this is working more frequently of late - changing the complexion of wins against Newcastle United and Aston Villa ‚Äì the switch shows Conte's frustration at Spurs' inability to get Plan A working. Their problem is that by starting so low, and in a division where most teams will press during a build-up phase, Conte's football needs a line-splitting creative midfielder who can perform from deep within his own half. Currently Spurs repeatedly get stuck making sideways moves, no matter which combination of Rodrigo Bentancur (their best at these forward passes, but not good enough), Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Harry Winks, or Oliver Skipp starts in these anchor roles. But with Eriksen spotting the more acute forward ball into Tottenham's front three, Conte's desire to play using artificial transitions ‚Äì vertical build-ups that have the appearance of counter-attacks, like Kulusevski's opener against Manchester City - can work more consistently. The only stumbling block is whether Eriksen has the defensive qualities or positional awareness to work in Tottenham's two-man midfield, where high work-rate is required to cover the yards across the width of the pitch. At Brentford, as at Inter and throughout his time at Spurs, Eriksen has been operating in a midfield three, by and large roaming the pitch with the freedom that comes from having two workmanlike central midfielders supporting him. Tottenham surely will not be moving away from the 3-4-3 any time soon; not with Son, Kane, and Kulusevski creating such a dynamic partnership up front. This is the most likely reason why Eriksen would only be signed as a squad player, featuring either in matches when Conte wishes to resort to a more conservative 3-5-2 or brought off the bench to add creative impetus when Spurs are struggling. In a World Cup year and with Eriksen entering the twilight of his career, he may feel that playing a starring role at a smaller club is of greater value.  As for Tottenham, though, re-signing Eriksen on a free transfer is a no-brainer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/eriksen-to-spurs-no-brainer-for-conte/blt1deb25c02afe10a3,Alex Keble,d8ff7d30-c19f-468c-b2ff-d904b79ef643
"Manchester City vs Leicester City: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Manchester City will be looking to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League table when they welcome Leicester City to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. City go into the Christmas weekend three points clear of Liverpool, who are not in action after their game with Leeds was postponed due to Covid-19. Currently enjoying an eight-match winning streak in the league, Man City are 2/11 (1.18) favourites with bet365 to open up a six-point lead at the top by coming out on top once again. Brendan Rodgers‚Äô men have not won any of their last five matches on the road but Leicester can be backed at 12/1 (13.0) to pull off a shock victory at the home of the champions. None of the last 12 league encounters between this duo have resulted in draws, but you can get odds of 13/2 (7.50) on them cancelling each other out in this one. Gabriel Jesus is the 9/2 (5.50) favourite to open the scoring against a team he has scored past in three of his last four league meetings, while Raheem Sterling represents strong value at 5/1 (6.0) after goals in four of his last seven league games. Jamie Vardy is the visitors' 12/1 (13.0) favourite to break the deadlock at a ground where he has scored four times in his last two visits, with James Maddison a tempting 22/1 (23.0) shot following goals in five of his last seven appearances. The last two meetings between this duo at this ground have been entertaining affairs, producing 11 goals and a victory for each team - with the Foxes running out 5-2 winners last season. While it is hard to see them pulling off another victory on current form, a high-scoring clash does look likely given they have seen 35 goals scored in their last eight fixtures in all competitions. With this in mind, odds of 11/10 (2.10) look like solid value on Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men extending their winning streak in Leicester‚Äôs seventh game in eight to feature over 3.5 goals.

Drinkwater apologises to Chelsea fans as he leaves club after five nightmare years,"Danny Drinkwater has apologised to Chelsea fans for failing to live up to expectations as he departs the club after five nightmare years. Drinkwater joined the Stamford Bridge team in 2017 from Leicester City, a year after he played a fantastic role in the Foxes' surprise Premier League title success.

After spending the 2021-22 season in the Championship with Reading, he has now finally left Chelsea as a free agent.

The May finale was set to be held in Saint Petersburg but the decision has been made to change the venue to Stade de France in Paris.¬† The Manchester United manager condemned the violence in Ukraine when he was asked about the conflict in his pre-match press conference.  He said: ""The situation is desperately sad, I think everybody will think similarly about that, it's just an incredible situation that we have a kind of war in Europe."" Having spent time living in Russia during his career he was asked further if he had spoken to anyone over there.  ""I think everybody has the same opinion about what's happening there. This is just a human disaster what's happening there for all the people involved,"" he said. ""Right now, as far as I can tell, the situtaion in Russia and Moscow is still safe but the whole situation but that doesn't change anything about the whole situation which is desperately sad.  ""When I watch TV in the morning and the evening I still cannot believe what I see. This is just a terrible situation and I very much hope the politicians all over the world deescalate the situation and finish those kind of things that are happening there.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ukraine-russia-invasion-man-utd-end-sponsorship-aeroflot/blte7e3e5b90becb56c,Charlotte Duncker,836bd727-6ed6-41a3-9975-e43cff2b2eb2
Zaha sets Premier League record as Crystal Palace defeat Manchester United,"Crystal Palace winger Wilfred Zaha has written his name in the Premier League history books thanks to his goal against Manchester United on Sunday evening. The Cote d‚ÄôIvoire international found the net in the first half as the Eagles defeated the visiting Red Devils 1-0 at Selhurst Park. Just 37 minutes into the clash, Zaha outmuscled Diogo Dalot before firing a low shot into the bottom left corner past goalkeeper David De Gea. 3 - No player to previously play for Man Utd in the Premier League has scored more goals against them in the competition than Wilfried Zaha (3). Haunting. #PL pic.twitter.com/WdhndtcSTd No player to have previously played for the Old Trafford side in the Premier League has scored more goals against them in the competition than the 29-year-old. United stepped up their game in the second half, but it was Patrick Vieira‚Äôs side who looked threatening when in possession. Conor Gallagher could have doubled the advantage on the hour mark but his strike went inches off the left post. A few minutes later Tunisia international Hannibal Mejbri was close to restoring parity for Ralf Rangnick‚Äôs side but his fine drive was saved by goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. At the end of 90 minutes, Crystal Palace held their nerve to secure all points at stake to end the 2021-22 campaign in the 12th position with 48 points to their credit. Man-of-the-match Zaha was in action from start to finish as well as Ghana international Jeffrey Schlupp, while Senegal international Cheikhou Kouyate was introduced for Jesurun Rak-Sakyi in the 67th minute. Nigeria prospect Eberechi Eze was thrown into the fray for Odsonne Edouard in the 79th minute, whereas, Ghana‚Äôs Jordan Ayew was an unused substitute. In his post-match reaction, Zaha disclosed the quality of Palace‚Äôs squad meant it is an exciting time to be at Selhurst Park. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just got to look at the team and the people on the bench,‚Äù he told the club website. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the most exciting Palace squad we‚Äôve ever had. The likes of [Eberechi] Eze, Michael [Olise], and JP [Mateta], there are numerous players. The future‚Äôs bright. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy we managed to get the three points. Obviously last game of the season games can go where people just go through the motions, but I‚Äôm glad we managed to get it over the line. ‚ÄúIt was a little bit inconsistent, but I was happy we managed to at least get a goal to put us in front and then anything else is a bonus, so I‚Äôm glad we got it over the line and got the three points.‚Äù ¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zaha-sets-premier-league-record-as-crystal-palace-defeat/blt8715ea38c33aa220,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,c72f37ac-86b0-42d6-a7f3-2b7d519ce0b9
Chelsea takeover: Ratcliffe's ¬£4.25 billion bid rejected 'out of hand',"British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe's bid to buy Chelsea for ¬£4.25 billion ($5.3bn) has been rejected. Ratcliffe launched a late challenge to fellow prospective owners Todd Boehly and his consortum, who have become the favourites to take control of the Stamford Bridge side. Ratcliffe has held talks with the Chelsea Supporters‚Äô Trust¬†about his proposal and Bloomberg reports he is set to meet with ex-Blues player Paul Canoville, who has already given his backing to Boehly's camp. Tom Crotty, a director at the Ineos Group owned by Ratcliffe, confirmed that the bank in charge of the sale of Chelsea, the Raine Group. has turned down their offer. ""We‚Äôve been rejected out of hand by Raine, but we will keep reminding people we are still here,"" he told Bloomberg. ""We will continue to engage with the fanbase. We see ourselves as a fan-based bid."" Another candidate to buy Chelsea from current owner Roman Abramovich is Sir Martin Broughton. Lord Sebastian Coe is part of Broughton's bid and the two-time Olympic gold medallist has warned that Raine Group must be careful when choosing their preferred bidder.  He told LBC: ""Fans like me want a resolution to this but they want to make sure the club lands in the right hands and that the club isn't lumbered with debt for the next 50 years. ""As someone who's been involved in sport, there is a vacuum here if we're not careful, which is going to impact on the players - it's certainly going to impact on the coaching.  ""To be sitting in a stadium where you're regularly 10,000 fans down because you can't sell seats - there is a problem here. ""The rest of the decisions have to be made properly, there is a process and this is a one-off. You don't see clubs being sold in these circumstances so Government will have to be really clear what it wants out of this."" The former track and field athlete joined Broughton's camp because he believes the club should end up in British hands. ""It was British. I actually genuinely think the club should end up with British ownership,"" he said.  ""I‚Äôm not being jingoistic ‚Äì I live in a global sporting world where properties are owned, but I do think that football is different. ""I still think there is a long way that the club can still go. If you look at Chelsea relative to other big European clubs, I still think there is probably a little bit of a delta if we‚Äôre being honest about that, and I do think that wherever this ends up.

"DC United vs Nashville: Predictions, tips & betting odds","DC United are out to end a five-game winless run in MLS this weekend when they host Nashville SC. The home team are joint-bottom of the Eastern Conference table with just 14 points from 14 matches and have taken just two points from their last five matches. Nashville, meanwhile, sit sixth in their conference, but they suffered a 2-1 loss in their last game. DC United have been in bad form recently but they are the favourites to get the win at 5/4 (2.25) with bet365, while the visitors are offered at 9/4 (3.25) and the draw is also set at 9/4 (3.25). Ola Kamara has scored six goals in MLS this season and is DC United's top scorer. He is 9/2 (5.50) to break the deadlock, while team-mate Michael Estrada is 5/1 (6.00) to open the scoring with his fifth goal of the campaign. Nashville attacker Hany Mukhtar is the lowest-priced Nashville player to get the first goal of the game at 5/1 (6.00). Nashville were on a good run of form as they went five games without defeat before they were beaten by Sporting Kansas City recently. The visitors may be without Randall Leal, Teal Bunbury and Robert Castellanos heading into this game, which will be a big blow. However, they will be determined to get the win this time out to help lift them to fourth in the division. DC United, meanwhile, are on an abysmal run and are missing Adrien Perez, Moses Nyeman and Chris Odoi-Atsem for this match. A win is a necessity for United, who are without a win in each of their last six matches. Both teams to score is priced at 4/5 (1.8) and may be a smart bet with a United team eager to get among the goals but struggling with a leaky defence. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

Caf Confederation Cup: ‚ÄòSimba will have referee in their pocket against Orlando Pirates‚Äô ‚Äì Banda,"South African giants Orlando Pirates have been warned on what to expect when they come face to face with Simba SC of Tanzania in the quarter-finals of the Caf Confederation Cup. The two teams were drawn to face each other on Tuesday and the first meeting will see the Buccaneers travel to Dar es Salaam on April 17 for the clash at Mkapa Stadium before the return leg on April 24 in Johannesburg. Ahead of the two-legged fixture, former Simba and Tanzania international Abdi Banda, who currently turns out for Mtibwa Sugar in the Mainland Premier League, has cautioned Pirates to be wary of Simba‚Äôs tactics when playing at home, including paying referees to favour their results.  ‚ÄúWhen Pirates come to Dar es Salaam, they must expect the worst and know that the battle will be beyond football because Simba is supported by politicians,‚Äù Banda said as quoted by KickOff. ‚ÄúSimba will have the referee in their pocket because Simba will give the referee money. Simba always uses dirty tactics when they play at home, but they obviously don‚Äôt have the kind of quality that Pirates so they will budget on winning at home by a wide margin.‚Äù However, the 26-year-old Banda, who has earned 18 caps for the Tanzania national team, is confident Pirates will qualify for the semis at the expense of the Wekundu wa Msimbazi. ‚ÄúWhat I know is that Pirates is going to qualify for the semi-finals after the two legs. It would have been a risk if Pirates played in Johannesburg first,‚Äù Banda continued. ‚ÄúPirates must make use of Senzo [Mazingiza] for the trip to Tanzania because he knows Tanzania very well and used to be at Simba before and is now at Yanga. Yanga will be happy to assist Pirates in whatever they need because they are enemies with Simba.‚Äù Banda has also called on Pirates to devise ways of dealing with Simba‚Äôs ‚Äúmost dangerous‚Äù player Bernard Morrison, who also played for the Buccaneers in the Premier Soccer League.  ""Morrison is a guy that will be out to prove a point to Pirates considering what happened in the past. I think Morrison had some misunderstandings with Pirates before so I know he will be out to show them what he can do,‚Äù added Banda. ‚ÄúHe has that kind of mentality of always wanting to prove himself to those that doubt him, and he usually gets the job done. ‚ÄúThe other threat for Simba is Sakho [Pape Ousmane] otherwise they don‚Äôt have a good team like they did last season, and it shows in the gap between them and Yanga who are top of the standings. ‚ÄúWhen they played Chiefs last season they had a better team.‚Äù Simba qualified for the last eight after finishing second in Group D with 10 points from six matches while Pirates finished top of Group A with 13 points from six outings.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/caf-confederation-cup-simba-will-have-referee-in-their/blt7a6971c83452eddf,Dennis Mabuka,ed51e7d8-27a2-4bd9-a775-53133b97c6c6
‚ÄòA crazy world!‚Äô - Nunez criticism stuns Klopp as Liverpool new boy silences doubters with four-goal showing,"Jurgen Klopp admits it is a ‚Äúcrazy world out there‚Äù after seeing Liverpool new boy Darwin Nunez offer the perfect response to baffling criticism by hitting four goals in a pre-season mauling of RB Leipzig. The Uruguayan striker opened his account for the Reds in style having previously failed to find the target through two earlier outings. Questions were asked by some about whether he could live up to a ¬£64 million ($77m) price tag as opportunities came and went against Manchester United and Crystal Palace, but Klopp was always convinced that a talented 23-year-old would come good as he slowly settles into life with Premier League heavyweights. Klopp has told Sky Sports of his surprise at learning that the highly-rated forward had become a target for online trolls so soon in his Anfield career, with the German tactician saying: ‚ÄúWe need time to get used to each other which is absolutely fine. It makes no sense to think he'd be at his absolute best after just three days of training. ‚ÄúThe group we have is the best I've had in terms of helping those from the outside coming in to settle. A striker of his skill set will need time as it's different to what we had before. ‚ÄúWe played in a different way to Benfica, so for me both sides have to adapt [the player and the existing players]. He didn't score in his first two games, in 50-odd minutes or whatever, and we immediately faced discussions. ‚ÄúThat's a crazy world out there! He then scores four goals in a game, and we're discussing him the other way around. ‚ÄúHe's a really nice guy, loves being here, our Spanish community players help him a lot and is learning English already, working hard to understand the basics - it's all going in the right direction.‚Äù Enjoy the best bits from last night's 5-0 victory over RB Leipzig üôå#LFCPreSeason pic.twitter.com/ljMWX8g507 The Liverpool new boy registered his first goal for the Reds from the penalty spot against Leipzig, and there was to be no stopping him from there.

"PSG 'were in the sh*t' after Real Madrid defeat, admits Marquinhos","Paris Saint-Germain were left ""in the sh*t"" after their Champions League round of 16 defeat to Real Madrid, Marquinhos has admitted. Madrid looked to be heading out of Europe after Kylian Mbappe scored the opener in the second leg of their tie against PSG, which put the French outfit 2-0 up on aggregate following their first leg win at Parc des Princes. However, the Blancos staged a stunning second-half comeback to win the match 3-1 and progress to the quarter-finals, with Marquinhos still feeling the disappointment of the final result almost two months later. The Brazilian defender inadvertently set up Karim Benzema with a misplaced pass as he completed his hat-trick on the night, and has admitted that he lost the ""duel"" against the striker. PSG's wait for a maiden European crown was extended due to the defeat and Lionel Messi and Neymar were booed by supporters in subsequent domestic matches. ‚ÄúIt was a hard match to digest,"" Marquinhos told Canal Plus when quizzed on the game. ""We the players, after a match like that frankly, sorry for the words but we are the first to be in sh*t. ""It was an important match for us. The next day, for me, even water was difficult to swallow. ""Benzema was great. I won a duel in the first leg and he won the second duel on the return. ""Maybe on that match, I should have focused more on my actions. Sometimes you want to think so much about the team, about the others and about everything around you."" PSG bounced back from their Champions League disappointment by going on to win their 10th Ligue 1 title, with a 1-1 draw against Lens on Saturday securing the trophy for Mauricio Pochettino's side with four games to spare. Marquinhos has played a key role in that triumph, and despite the turbulent nature of the French outfit's 2021-22 campaign, he remains quite content at Parc des Princes and would be open to seeing out the remainder of his playing days in Paris. ""Right now, no, I don‚Äôt want to leave,"" the 27-year-old, whose current contract is due to expire in 2024, replied after being asked if he could be tempted by a summer move away from PSG. ""At the start, there was a time when I was interested in doing so, but since then my mind‚Äôs always been here at PSG. My desire is to stay. We know how it goes in football ‚Äì as long as you‚Äôre performing and playing well, you can have a desire to stay. ‚ÄúBut sometimes, things can change or the club can no longer want you, as we‚Äôve seen in the past. If possible, I‚Äôd like to stay for life here in Paris. That would very much suit me and I would be happy with it.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-were-in-the-sh-t-after-real-madrid-defeat-admits/blt1310420256fed4df,James Westwood,1aa9bd9c-4029-4da4-9d7a-2f4cf92cf898
Who is winning the 27-strong race to buy Chelsea FC from Roman Abramovich?,"Roman Abramovich's sale of Chelsea through US investment bank Raine Group enters the final stages with the last remaining bidders entering the fray.¬† There are thought to be 27 billionaire consortiums, hedge funds and other high net worth players registering their monetary bids with their plans for the future attached.¬† The deadline is on Friday at 9pm UK time (5pm EST) for the majority partners to officially submit their proposals and offers, at which point they will be narrowed down to just a few before a final decision is made.¬† First of all, this is not necessarily a bidding war, with the winners to be chosen more on their ability to run a major sports organisation. Any offers to include part-fan ownership or a place on the board for supporters will be welcomed, but it won't be a requirement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).¬† They also want potential buyers to commit to maintaining the activity in the women's team, academy and Chelsea Foundation. Alongside that, any proposals to develop Stamford Bridge, which remains small for a club of Chelsea's size would also be seen in a positive light. The first group to go public about buying Chelsea were¬†Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss, who have since added London property developer¬†Jonathan Goldstein¬†to their ranks.¬† They have also brought in Danny Finkelstein, a former UK government adviser, and Barbara Charone, a PR executive with clients including Madonna, Rod Stewart and Foo Fighters, to their ranks as non-executive board directors should their bid become successful. The pair are two of the Blues' most high-profile supporters and regularly attend home matches.¬† The Ricketts family, who own Major League Baseball (MLB) team the Chicago Cubs, have linked up with hedge fund leader Ken Griffin to make an offer.¬† Also from the United States is Woody Johnson, who owns the NFL's New York Jets. He is said to have launched a ¬£2bn ($2.6bn) bid for the west Londoners.¬† There's offers from the United Kingdom with Aethel Partners, a financial institution in London, offering a ¬£2bn ($2.6bn) proposal with a further ¬£50 million ($66m) to be immediately released to cover the costs of this uncertain period. Although UK-based, the firm is headed by Portuguese entrepreneur Ricardo Silva. London luxury property developer and Chelsea supporter Nick Candy has been very public about his interest in buying Chelsea. He is currently working with Blues legend Gianluca Vialli's company Tifosy Capital and Advisory to help raise funds.¬† Lord Sebastian Coe, a Conservative Member of Parliament, Chelsea supporter and former Athletics athlete, is in the running to buy the Blues with fellow fan and former Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton.¬† Creative Artists Agency's investment bank Evolution Media Capital is also backing Broughton and Coe. There are fears that it could be seen as insider trading, with CAA owning the world's biggest football agency. Outside of the UK and US are other players, with the most notable option being Saudi Media. The private consortium led by Chelsea supporting Mohamed Alkhereiji, who is also the CEO of the parent company Engineer Holding Group.¬† Although Alkhereiji has worked and lived in the UK for an extended period, it remains to be seen whether being from Saudi Arabia will adversely affect their bid.¬† They have wide-reaching plans for Chelsea including replacing shirt sponsor Three with an option from the Middle East and redeveloping Stamford Bridge.¬† South Korean¬†C&P Sports Group and Hana Financial Group have said they have made a bid.¬†C&P¬†CEO Catalina Kim said: ""We are preparing our bid.¬† ""There has never been investment into a top tier football club made by South Korean capital before. It is time for a change.‚Äù Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak, chairman of AB Grup Holding, has been vocal in his interest and 'wants to fly the flag of Turkey at Stamford Bridge.' However, several sources have played down his role as a frontrunner.¬† The FT have added that US investment company Oaktree have made an offer on Chelsea but sources close to the company refused to comment.¬† British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously expressed an interest in buying Chelsea before securing French side Nice in 2019. However, he has since withdrawn his interest after Abramovich put the club up for sale. There are thought to be almost a dozen other bids that have yet to be made public.  John Terry is leading a ¬£250 million ($329m) from a secret 'True Blue' consortium to put the supporters at the heart of the club, through NFT and fan tokens.¬†Similarly,¬†a¬†group called ChelseaDAO (a decentralised autonomous organisation) says they are trying to buy a 10% stake to allow supporters a say through fan tokens using the cryptocurrency¬†Ethereum.¬† It is hoped that it will be completed sooner rather than later to minimise costs being felt at the club. Every day that the club is sanctioned is damaging the Blues's bottom line and could lead to cash flow issues further down the line.¬† There's an appetite to do a deal quickly to ensure Chelsea can become unsanctioned again so the club can operate as normal as soon as possible.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-is-winning-the-27-strong-race-to-buy-chelsea-fc-from/bltbf16e4d01725027e,Nizaar Kinsella,7549ea0c-38ba-472e-ad2d-e216823bc537

Ramos: I would like to play four or five more years,"Sergio Ramos hopes to continue playing at football's top level for up to five more years. The 35-year-old joined Paris Saint-Germain from Real Madrid last summer after his contract with the Spanish giants expired. But the Spain international's time in France has been plagued by injury, limiting him to to just seven appearances in all competitions this season. Ramos' issues have sparked suggestions he could leave PSG after just one season at the club, but he insists he wants to see out his contract with the organisation and spend even more time playing in a top league. ""I would like to play between four and five more years at the top level and then live another experience,"" the centre-back told Amazon Prime. ""I have two years at PSG, we will try to do three and then we'll see. As long as my physical condition holds up, I think I can keep my mind focused. ""I prefer to play in the best team in the world than to be the best player because in the end football is a collective sport and it is about winning as a team.  ""Before being the best in the world, I prefer to play world championships, Champions League. And for everything, you always need the work of the team."" Ramos made his sixth Ligue 1 appearance on Saturday when they beat Clermont 6-1. It is the first time he has completed the full 90 minutes for PSG since January 23, when they beat Reims 4-0. Since then, the defender had been out of action with a calf injury. Earlier in the season he had been kept out by a previous calf injury and another muscle issue.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ramos-i-would-like-to-play-four-or-five-more-years/blt03aec56823bf3639,By Peter McVitie,3322975a-38e0-407f-82c6-acb4882469e2
"Bissouma's Brighton masterclass proves why Arsenal, Aston Villa are circling","Aston Villa and Arsenal target Yves Bissouma was a dominant player for Brighton and Hove Albion in their 1-0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Brighton secured the win courtesy of Leandro Trossard‚Äôs clinical 90th-minute finish past Hugo Lloris. Trossard has netted six goals in the league this season, which is his best-ever return in the competition, eclipsing the five he scored in both 2019-20 and 2020-21. Meanwhile, Bissouma was a solid performer for the Seagulls as he was near-perfect defensively, and did a good job of breaking down Spurs' attacks. The 25-year-old, who is understood to be on his way out as Villa and Arsenal are said to be interested, was instrumental as they brilliantly picked up another win in London after beating Arsenal last week. Bissouma and his teammates registered a first victory at Tottenham since 1981 as they also dimmed their hosts‚Äô chances of finishing in the top four. A win would have seen Spurs go six points clear of Arsenal in fourth position.  The Gunners ‚Äì who play Southampton on Saturday, could move level with Spurs, although they enjoy a game in hand. The Seagulls are only the second team in Premier League history to win away at both Arsenal and Tottenham in consecutive league games after Hull City in October 2008. The London side were shambolic and did not register a single shot on target over 90 minutes, even though they had scored at least twice in each of their previous seven matches. As Bissouma enjoyed a stellar outing, his teammate Enock Mwepu walked a tightrope after he was booked for a challenge on Sergio Reguilon and could have easily been sent off after stepping on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. The Zambian was later replaced by Danny Welbeck in the 46th minute. The loss at the hands of Bissouma‚Äôs teammates means Tottenham have now lost three of their last six home Premier League games (W3), as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 14 on home soil (W10 D1). On the other hand, Brighton have won consecutive away league games for the first time since September 2021 and are now unbeaten in three league games overall, winning the last two, after losing each of the six before that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bissouma-brighton-masterclass-proves-why-arsenal-aston-villa-are-/bltb3ad4811f05d4534,Kiplagat Sang,fa506621-6313-483c-8746-546ce3b1a6ec
USMNT striker Hoppe completes transfer to Middlesbrough as World Cup looms,"U.S. men's national team striker Matthew Hoppe has completed his move to Middlesbrough, the club announced. The striker joins from Mallorca as he looks to make a late push for a spot in the USMNT squad at the 2022 World Cup. Hoppe becomes the second American on the books at Boro, joining Zack Steffen, who will spend the season on loan with the club from Manchester City. The 21-year-old Hoppe has signed a four-year contract with Boro. Hoppe burst onto the scene at Schalke in late 2020 and early 2021, scoring a hat-trick against Hoffenheim in January 2021 to announce his arrival in the Bundesliga.  He finished the season with six goals and, after Schalke's relegation, he moved to Mallorca in La Liga.  However, he made only seven appearances for the club as he battled injuries and Covid-19, effectively derailing what ended up as his only season in La Liga. Internationally, Hoppe has six caps for the USMNT and has scored one goal: the game-winner in a 1-0 victory over Jamaica in the Gold Cup quarter-finals. As things stand, Hoppe is likely on the outside looking in when it comes to booking a spot in Qatar. The striker has not been called in by the U.S. since October and, after a difficult season at Mallorca, has fallen down the pecking order. His versatility and energy could be a valuable asset to the U.S., though, as he featured on the wings at the Gold Cup last summer.

The unity shown by athletes and fans in sending messages of support to the nation after Russia‚Äôs invasion has been huge, with Manchester City‚Äôs Oleksandr Zinchenko, captain of the men‚Äôs national team, having been moved to tears by the affection being shown. For Nadia Nadim, a refugee herself who fled Afghanistan as a child after her father was executed by the Taliban regime, it‚Äôs been ""amazing"" to see people come together to spread these messages, but the reasons why they are needed continue to sadden her. ""I understand how the people feel,"" Nadim told GOAL. ""No one really wants to leave their families, homes, identity, everything behind. ""I can see by the pictures how the kids are and everyone's just in distress. It breaks my heart. I hate wars. For me, it doesn't make any sense. There's a lot of ways you can solve your problems and by killing innocent people, I don't think that's the solution. It has never been. ""That's the worst part for me - it's always the innocent ones that pay the price. The children, women, the ones that are not even involved. They have nothing to say. It's heartbreaking to watch."" Nadim has never been one to stand by while such things are happening, though. Last summer, she helped raise almost $90,000 for Afghan women after the Taliban took control of her home country again. Now, the Racing Louisville forward is working with Game of Our Lives (GOL), a social platform designed to encourage and facilitate social activism, on its Humane Ukraine campaign, which launched on Friday morning. Through it, people can donate items or money, sign petitions, educate others and more. ""I thought it was an amazing idea,"" Nadim said. ""I want to help, I want to make a change and having a platform where you actually have more people to help you and see it, I think that's a cool way to do it. For me, it was a no-brainer."" Initially, when Nadim was approached about working with GOL, it was to create action that could empower women and girls, addressing gender inequality. The focus now is on helping those in Ukraine ‚Äì but she has ""a lot of plans"" further down the line, too. ""In so many countries, girls are not allowed to get an education or even be a part of sports,"" she said. ""Having the opportunity to maybe bring sports in one way or another will be amazing because - this is something from my experience - I think football has a huge power. It's not just a game, it's also a tool to educate. ""I feel like I've done it when I was younger, in my community. I just kept playing football and then, in the end, people turn and have a different point of view. If we can do that on a bigger scale and in areas where girls are not allowed to attend football, then we educate the people around them. That'll be amazing. ""You want little girls to have the same opportunities, same access, as boys."" Demanding better for women and girls has always been something Nadim has stood for. Last year, as the NWSL was rocked by allegations of negligence and sexual abuse, she drew attention to some of her experiences. In a series of tweets, Nadim claimed that her signature had been faked on a contract extension in the past and, after suffering an ACL injury in September, that lawyers at the league said she had to have surgery in the U.S., or they could consider taking ""actions"" against her. ""If something's unfair, or something's not being done right, I think you have an obligation to use your voice,"" she added. ""By using your voice, you're addressing an issue. By addressing the issue, you have the opportunity to change it or fix the problem. For me, it's always been the case. ""I was in shock when all of that happened [in the NWSL] and it seems like it's been going on for such a long time. That's what bothered me, you know? Imagine if we had stopped this earlier. We could've helped so many girls or players before. ""I really hope that from now on, in the future, we're not going to see things like that in the league and then the only thing we have to concentrate on is football and how we can improve the game even more and make it even bigger.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ukraine-refugee-nwsl-nadia-nadim-helping-victims-russia/blt934ccfa3dd78fbf2,Ame√© Ruszkai,73de40ac-3b17-4497-8b2e-3dcff369e6d4
"Pochettino, Ten Hag, Tuchel or Lopetegui: Who should Man Utd hire as their next manager?","If at the beginning of last week Ralf Rangnick held a flicker of hope he would be Manchester United manager next season, then defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League second round has surely extinguished it. Man Utd enter the international break on a run of one win in five matches in all competitions and closer to West Ham in seventh than Arsenal in fourth. They are also on track to win 66 points, which, strangely enough, would be the fourth time they‚Äôve hit that total in the last seven years.  It is a fitting symbol of their stagnation in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson years. It goes without saying they need to get the next appointment right but, at the risk of being overly dramatic, this does feel like a sliding doors moment for the club. By the end of next season, it will be 10 years since the club‚Äôs last league title, a significant milestone that will cause more soul-searching at Old Trafford. By then, they need to have in place a long-term vision; a structure that has a league title in its sights but with an understanding that, realistically, it will take several years to get to the level that Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool and Pep Guardiola‚Äôs Manchester City are at. As Liverpool supporters can attest to, the first 10 years without a title are rough, but not as rough as the next 10. It gets tougher with every year that passes, and Man Utd must ready themselves for a long process that demands patience. There is no quick fix and no time to waste. Broadly speaking, there are two directions United can go. One route is towards hard pressing and verticality, the other a more patient possession approach: the Klopp way or the Guardiola way.¬† GOAL sources say that Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag are level-pegging in the eyes of the decision-makers at United, with Julen Lopetegui, Thomas Tuchel and Luis Enrique the others being considered. Luis Enrique is surely out of the question as he is determined to lead Spain into the World Cup this winter. The other four neatly reflect that choice between the two dominant tactical systems in European football. The Argentine has been tracked by United for a very long time now and it is believed he would love the job. Pochettino has struggled to handle the egotism that drives Paris Saint-Germain, finding player power too great for his tactical beliefs to take hold.  But rather than see Pochettino‚Äôs time in Paris as a sign he is not capable of managing a difficult group, we should view him as someone with the lived experience to handle it. PSG are a perfect example of how not to build a football club and, right now, United are hovering alarmingly close to the same approach. From the leaks to broadsheet newspapers about Rangnick‚Äôs methods to the whinging we see on the pitch, Man Utd could do with a manager who has seen this kind of behaviour at its worst and will work to stamp it out before things spiral out of control. From a tactical perspective, he is the ideal fit. Pochettino‚Äôs desire to play hard-pressing football that focuses on verticality in the transition is in keeping with the Premier League‚Äôs tactical shift towards the Germanic way of playing. He is not hugely dissimilar from Thomas Tuchel ‚Äì another manager GOAL understands United are assessing ‚Äì although Pochettino teams press higher. Pochettino‚Äôs focus on using overlapping full-backs to provide penetration from out wide means United would need a new right-back at the very least but, elsewhere, there are the foundations for a move towards direct football that makes use of the transitions. Fred would be an ideal box-to-box midfielder for Pochettino or Tuchel, while Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga have the explosive pace that would suit the attacking attitudes of the two managers. However, neither would be keen on Harry Maguire, requiring a more agile defender to cope with holding a high line, while more press-resistant and creative players are needed in central midfield.¬† Then there is the Cristiano Ronaldo problem, as the Portuguese's presence may inform which path United choose.  His unwillingness to press as part of a collective system and sacrifice himself makes the Kloppite option less appealing than the Guardiola style of suffocation and control, which, in theory, allows for a penalty-box poacher. Man Utd may wish to see themselves more as over-dogs, as football royalty who want to completely dominate matches as Manchester City do.  If that‚Äôs the case, then Ten Hag or Julen Lopetegui ‚Äì the latter lower further down the list ‚Äì make more sense due to their greater focus on possession. Ten Hag has been credited with reviving the classic Ajax teams of the past with his slower style of football, which requires constant circulation of possession; opponents are gradually worn down after being camped in their own third for long periods. Lopetegui‚Äôs Sevilla are less successful ‚Äì owing to their relative size compared with the superclubs in Spain- but they hold 60.8 per cent possession on average in La Liga.¬† Their primary ambition is to keep the ball high up the pitch for long periods and while this works from a defensive standpoint ‚Äì they have the best record in Spain ‚Äì it does mean Sevilla struggle to break opponents down. They have drawn 12 times domestically this season. Perhaps Lopetegui would have greater success with a more powerful team like Man Utd.  Certainly, with Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, and (possibly) Paul Pogba in the starting XI, the territorial advantages of being managed by Lopetegui or Ten Hag should mean more meaningful possession in creative areas of the pitch for United‚Äôs stars. Aside from the forward areas, there would be few differences in the transfer policies of the respective candidates. Lopetegui and Ten Hag also consider attacking full-backs to be crucial, and would want a right-back. United are crying out for a defensive midfield destroyer who can play progressive forward passes, so no matter who comes in, Declan Rice ought to be a target. In choosing Guardiola or Klopp, possession or verticality, it is initially tempting to assume the slower and more dominant system is a better fit.  It is closer to the club‚Äôs self-image of global domination and more accommodating to the individualists in their rank. But the main reason United are in this mess is their nostalgia, inability to move with the times, and indulgence of superstars. For that reason, and with Tuchel highly likely to remain at Chelsea, Pochettino is the answer. Many United fans are concerned about the lack of silverware in Pochettino‚Äôs history but, of all the available candidates, he possesses the best mix of attributes to build a long-term project with the support of the dressing room and supporters.¬† That is the most important trait of all, far more so than pre-existing ideas of the candidates‚Äô tactical philosophies.  Because while crude distinctions can be made between the four names here, in reality, all are very talented coaches capable of some adaptation to the unique demands of the Premier League and the idiosyncrasies of the current squad. The advantage of Pochettino is a hardened appreciation of what to expect from an egotistical dressing room; a tactical ideology built on self-sacrifice that has been proven to work in the Premier League; and a track record of nurturing young players. United are forever trapped in a media circus, but with a known and likeable figure like Pochettino in charge, there would at least be space ‚Äì emotionally as well as tactically ‚Äì for the project to take baby steps over the first two years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pochettino-ten-hag-lopetegui-tuchel-man-utd-next-manager/bltda595ed0773b5b66,Alex Keble,7efea138-0b8b-45a6-86da-b26b02c5bb40
Mourinho fumes after Roma defeat: 'There's a reason we earn a lot more than journalists!',"Jose Mourinho refused to take questions after Roma's 3-0 home defeat against Inter and told a reporter that there's a reason ""we earn a lot more than you"". He said being a manager was much more difficult than journalism, leading to the gulf in pay. Rather than answer for his squad's performance, he delivered a brief monologue and exited the press conference. ‚ÄúYour job is a lot easier than ours which is why we earn a lot more than you,"" the Roma manager told the first reporter who tried to ask a question.

It was very important to score a goal, because we would only have two or three chances.

Haaland transfer: Decision on future in 'next few weeks' amid rumours Barcelona confident of signing Dortmund star,"Borussia Dortmund's head of first-team football Sebastian Kehl has confirmed the club are planning to make a decision on Erling Haaland's future in ""the next few weeks"" amid rumours Barcelona are confident of signing the striker. Haaland committed to a four-and-a-half-year contract at Dortmund when signing from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020, but his stock has risen since then in scoring 76 goals in his first 75 appearances across all competitions for the German giants. A number of top clubs across Europe are now being credited with an interest in the 21-year-old including Barca, and Kehl has offered an update on his situation with the winter transfer window open. It has been reported Barca president Joan Laporta has told colleagues at Camp Nou he will bring Haaland to Camp Nou in the summer, at which point his ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£63m/$85m) release clause will be active. Kehl admits the ball is in Haaland's court with regards to his next move, but remains hopeful a prized asset will opt to continue his development at Dortmund. ""The situation is very clear, he has the opportunity to get out [of his contract in the summer],"" the Dortmund chief told a press conference.¬† ""There are certainly a few more reasons why Haaland is in very good hands at Borussia Dortmund and why we as a club can continue to be a very good option for him. ""We will sit down with Erling and his team in the next few weeks and discuss the situation intensively. It would be good if a decision doesn't drag on forever."" Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have also been linked with Haaland, but it has been reported Spain is his first choice destination. However, Barca look set to face stiff competition for the Norwegian's signature from arch-rivals Real Madrid, who are the only club to have been confirmed as potential suitors by Dortmund to date. CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said last month: ""All I know is that Real Madrid are very interested in him. I could name 25 others now, but with Real I know for sure. I think he would fit in better in Spain.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-transfer-future-rumours-barcelona-dortmund/blt75e5cee562544489,James Westwood,e744bdff-5174-4ffe-abff-6d58f5dc5758
"Ronaldo dropped for Burnley v Man Utd as game 'requires a lot of sprinting', says Rangnick","Cristiano Ronaldo was dropped for Manchester United's clash with Burnley on Tuesday as manager Ralf Rangnick said the game will require ""a lot of sprinting"". For Tuesday's match, Rangnick opted to turn to Edinson Cavani, who was named to the starting XI ahead of Ronaldo after he started and missed a penalty against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup in the club's last match. Rangnick explained the decision to bench Ronaldo ahead of kickoff, saying he believes Cavani fits the gameplan better. ‚ÄúToday it will require a lot of sprinting, chasing balls, a lot of fight for second balls,"" Rangnick said before the match. ""This best fits the profile for Edinson Cavani which is why he starts today."" Ronaldo has struggled in recent weeks, by his lofty standards, having failed to score in each of his last four matches.

Ivory Coast haven't given up on convincing England international Guehi to play for them despite ex-Chelsea defender winning his first Three Lions cap,"Ivory Coast manager Patrice Beaumelle has revealed he has plans to see if he can convince Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi to switch nationalities. The young centre-back made his debut for England in a friendly against Switzerland on Saturday but he is still eligible to switch to the country of his birth should he choose to do so. Wilfried Zaha has previously played for England before switching to Ivory Coast and Guehi, who has been playing alongside the winger at Selhurst Park this season, could have the option to follow suit. Ahead of the friendly against England on Tuesday, Beaumelle said: ""I have been following Marc for two years, since he was playing at Swansea. I¬†know he can still choose Ivory Coast so we are working on that.  ""I tried to contact him several weeks ago. But when I saw him in the English lists I understood that at the moment he wants to try with the Three Lions. ""The choice has to come from the heart. He will make his own decision.¬†He did well in his first cap for England. Maybe we will try for the orange jersey of Ivory Coast - you never know. ""I will wait a few weeks and try to contact him to know if he is interested‚Äã."" Guehi is another player to come through the Chelsea youth ranks to enjoy success elsewhere as he looked to ensure he developed properly. After rising through the ranks at Stamford Bridge, he opted to go on loan to Swansea City twice which eventually earned him a permanent move to Crystal Palace last summer. Guehi has featured for Palace 33 times across all competitions this season and his performances earned him a call-up into Gareth Southgate's plans ahead of the 2022 World Cup.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ivory-coast-convincing-england-defender-guehi-crystal-palace/bltc59e904bf9b2c560,Marwan Harraz,d4a65b06-d236-4bae-86bb-cea6660faeed

Arsenal's improvement obvious despite four minutes of madness in devastating Man City defeat,"Arsenal 1-2 Manchester City Spare a thought for Mikel Arteta‚Äôs neighbours.¬† Arsenal‚Äôs manager admitted before Saturday‚Äôs game against Manchester City that he would not be able to sit down while having to watch from home due to a positive test for Covid-19. And given how things turned out at the Emirates, you can only imagine what noises were coming from his front room as he watched events unfold during the second half in north London. This was football at its dramatic, absorbing best. For 57 minutes, Arsenal were electric. Arteta‚Äôs side were all over the Premier League leaders and were thoroughly deserving of their 1-0 lead, given to them by Bukayo Saka‚Äôs superb first-half goal. But then the game changed completely during four remarkable minutes around¬†the hour mark.¬† There was a Manchester City penalty after a foul by Granit Xhaka, a goal-line clearance from Nathan Ake, an open-goal miss by Gabriel Martinelli and a red card for Gabriel Magalhaes ‚Äì the kind of incredible the drama that only the Premier League can produce ‚Äì and it paved the way for a last-minute winner from Rodri that has likely secured the visitors a fourth title in five years. 57' Mahrez scores penalty57' Gabriel booked58' Ake clears off the line58' Martinelli misses open goal59' Gabriel sent offLadies and gentlemen, the Premier League ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/yL9bdGLlvs Arsenal were furious, with the spot-kick converted by Riyad Mahrez only given by VAR after referee Stuart Attwall had initially ignored the visitors' appeals for a foul on Bernardo Silva. A replay of the incident was shown on the big screen after the decision had been overturned, with Arsenal‚Äôs players clearly incensed, believing that the Portuguese was already on his way down when his shirt was slightly tugged by Xhaka. Gabriel was booked for his protests and then, moments later, after Martinelli had fired wide with the goal at his mercy, the Brazilian centre-back crashed into Gabriel Jesus and was dismissed. Bedlam ensued. A match that Arsenal were completely in charge of had been turned on its head. Quite what was going on in Arteta‚Äôs front room at that point in time is anyone‚Äôs guess! But it was probably tame in comparison to his reaction to Rodri‚Äôs injury-time winner. As defeats go, this was as cruel as they come for Arsenal. But when they calm down and take stock over the next couple of days, they will be able to take an awful lot from this performance. Time and time again we‚Äôve seen the Gunners surrender meekly in the face of the likes of City. But this was a performance which showed just how far they‚Äôve come in a short space of time since the dark days of the opening weeks of the season. Bukayo Saka has four goals in his last three Premier League games üòé pic.twitter.com/a5VqiJP51U They were blown away at the Etihad in August, losing 5-0, but on Saturday they showed they couldn‚Äôt just compete with the champions ‚Äì they could outplay them. Only four of the team that began the defeat in Manchester started on Saturday, such as has been the level of change at Arsenal since August, and Arteta‚Äôs new-look side were rampant from the opening exchanges. Arsenal had found themselves 1-0 down inside the first three minutes during their previous three meetings with City at the Emirates, so they knew they had to start well and they did exactly that. The visitors didn‚Äôt even muster a shot on target during the opening 45 minutes as Arsenal tore into them, with Thomas Partey exceptional in midfield and Martinelli and Saka electric down the flanks. The latter gave Arsenal a deserved lead just after the half-hour mark, finishing off a sweeping move with an expert finish into the corner. It was no more than the hosts deserved and the only real negative of the opening 45 minutes was they didn‚Äôt add to their lead, with Martinelli twice going close to grabbing a second. The start to the second half was no different, until those four minutes of madness just before the hour mark transformed a contest that had been going perfectly for Arsenal. Replays showed Xhaka did grab hold of Silva as he went past, but the Portuguese midfielder certainly went down easily.¬† The fact that the decision was eventually overturned by VAR ‚Äì who chose not to get involved in the first half when Ederson appeared to trip Martin Odegaard in the box ‚Äì only added to Arsenal‚Äôs sense of injustice. But that should not excuse the way Gabriel lost his head and got himself sent off. The defender got his first booking after charging up to Stuart Attwell to complain after the penalty incident had been shown on the big screens and then the second followed less than two minutes later when he collided with Jesus on the halfway line. It was clear that he had let frustration get the better of him and it proved to be a costly mistake, with City going on to get the win in the final few seconds through Rodri. Arsenal were crestfallen at the end and it‚Äôs impossible not to view this as a massive missed opportunity.¬† Perhaps a more streetwise, experienced team would have got the job done, or at least got themselves over the line to claim what would have been a deserved draw. But ill-discipline saw them end up with nothing to show for their considerable efforts. For now, they remain fourth, but with Tottenham and Manchester United both having games in hand, they have lost some ground in the race for the Champions League spots. Sometimes, however, you have to look at the bigger picture and even though they ended this one empty-handed, they showed they can go toe to toe with the best in the business once again.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-improvement-four-minutes-of-madness-man-city-defeat/blt47c0f7b9abd05724,Charles Watts,bd35748a-a704-4039-9507-06413c939d16
LA Galaxy add ex-Juventus defender Caceres on free transfer,"WHAT HAPPENED? The 35-year-old Uruguayan veteran has signed a contract that runs through the end of the MLS season with a club option for 2023. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The signing gives the Galaxy a veteran defensive presence as they push for the playoffs, with the club currently holding onto the last Western Conference playoff position in seventh place. IN THREE PHOTOS: Caceres won the treble with Barcelona in 2008-09. He is perhaps best known for his time at Juventus, where he contributed to six Serie A titles, two Coppa Italia triumphs and two Suppercoppa Italiana victories. Caceres has 112 appearances for Uruguay's national team and started and played 88 minutes in his country's 2011 Copa America final win over Paraguay while also featuring at three World Cups. WHAT THEY SAID: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to bring Martin to the Galaxy as he brings a wealth of experience to the club,‚Äù said LA Galaxy Technical Director Jovan Kirovski. ‚ÄúHe played at a high level in Serie A and LaLiga last season and played a key role in Uruguay‚Äôs qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We are thrilled to have a player of his caliber on our club for this stretch run to the playoffs.‚Äù DID YOU KNOW? Caceres has previously played for 11 clubs during his illustrious career: Defensor Sporting Club (2006-07), Recreativo Huelva (2007-08), Barcelona (2008-09), Juventus (2009-10, 2011-2016, 2018-2019), Sevilla (2010-12), Southampton (2016-17), Hellas Verona (2017-18), Lazio (2017-2019), Fiorentina (2019-2021), Cagliari (2021-22) and Levante (2011-22). THE VERDICT: The signing of Caceres gives the Galaxy a veteran presence for the stretch run and is a low-risk/high-reward signing for a team that needs defensive leadership. It remains to be seen how Caceres will handle MLS but, given the structure of the contract, he's certainly worth a look for the Galaxy. WHAT NEXT FOR THE GALAXY? The Galaxy will face the New England Revolution on Sunday, although it remains to be seen when and how Caceres will fit in once he joins the group.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/la-galaxy-add-ex-juventus-defender-caceres-on-free-transfer/blt53b4e258301f9483,Ryan Tolmich,471f1c67-6961-4651-a970-63bb79cae802
"NFF sack entire Super Eagles technical crew, confirm Eguavoen resignation","The Nigeria Football Federation have announced the sacking of the entire Super Eagles coaching crew while confirming the resignation of Augustine Eguavoen earlier on Thursday. The NFF took the decision following the country‚Äôs failure to qualify for the 2022 Fifa World Cup following a 1-1 draw with Ghana at the M.K.O Abiola Stadium, Abuja on Tuesday, confirming the news in a statement on their official Twitter handle.

Before he was axed, the 68-year-old came under heavy criticism from Nigerians after the Super Eagles struggled but eventually advanced from Group C in the second round of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.

"Getafe vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona travel to the Coliseum Alfonso Perez to face Getafe on Sunday, with Xavi Hernandez's men aiming to secure second place in La Liga. Avoiding a defeat in the Spanish capital would confirm the Blaugrana as runners-up and bring them direct entry to the Spanish Super Cup, landing them a much-needed financial windfall. Getafe know a point should secure their top-flight status and Los Azulones have drawn each of their last three matches. Another stalemate is priced at 11/5 (3.20) with bet365 while Barca can be backed at 6/5 (2.20) and the hosts are offered at 13/5 (3.60). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the favourite to score first at 4/1 (5.00) while Memphis Depay, who broke the deadlock in the midweek win over Celta Vigo at Camp Nou, can be backed at 9/2 (5.50). Getafe's top scorer is Enes Unal, with the Turkish forward enjoying his best scoring campaign after netting 15 in the league. Unal is priced at 5/1 (6.00) to be first goalscorer ahead of Barca's Ferran Torres at 11/2 (6.50). The Catalans are unbeaten on the road under Xavi Hernandez, with their last away defeat in La Liga coming in Ronald Koeman's final game in charge at Rayo Vallecano on October 27. Indeed, Barca have won each of their last six clashes away from Camp Nou and there will be plenty of interest in backing them to claim another win against a Getafe side who are all but mathematically safe. Los Azulones have been strong at home but Barca have won 10 of their last 12 matches against the side from the south of Madrid and should be confidently backed to claim their 10th away win of the campaign. Barcelona to win is priced at 6/5 (2.20) and is surely a price that will attract attention, while backing them to win a game with over 2.5 goals looks like an appealing value option at 13/5 (3.60).

PSG defender Kurzawa confronted by supporters demanding exit,"Paris Saint-Germain defender Layvin Kurzawa was acosted by supporters calling for his exit from the club on Wednesday, with the left-back having to be seemingly physically restrained from a confrontation. Despite their healthy lead at the top of Ligue 1, the Parc des Princes outfit have emerged into a spite-riddled relationship with their own supporters following their Champions League collapse earlier this month. Several players have already been targeted, including Neymar and Lionel Messi, and now Kurzawa is the latest figure to find himself at loggerheads with the club's fanbase.

It comes on the back of club ultras leading mass protests at matches and a sustained booing campaign against particular players, exacerbated in the wake of their European collapse last week to Real Madrid. Kurzawa is far from the only player to have come under fire from PSG supporters, who have also turned their ire on longtime club stalwart Neymar and first-season buy Messi as targets for their derision. The duo were booed every time they touched the ball during Sunday's 3-0 win over Bordeaux, while manager Mauricio Pochettino remains a favourite target too.

So when did warm up kits become more important than match kits?,"The amount of time that a pre-match kit is on the pitch is tiny. Players run onto the pitch in them, sometimes covered by bibs, before going through their warm up and last-minute drills. By the time the main match begins, the pre-match kits are long gone, replaced by the recognisable colours of the home, away or third shirts. Nowadays, though, pre-match kits have become an important part of the kit collection.

'Van Dijk is a monster' - Liverpool's most important player back to his very best,"What a difference a year makes. Twelve months ago, Virgil van Dijk was coming to terms with the biggest disappointment of his career.¬† Now, he‚Äôs looking to add another Champions League winners medal to his collection, and re-establish himself as Europe‚Äôs best defender in the process. ‚ÄúI feel great right now,‚Äù the Dutchman said this week, and no wonder.  After the nightmare of last season, the busted knee and that long, lonely road to recovery, things could hardly have gone better for the 29-year-old since. With him back in the side, Liverpool have been very much back in business. They‚Äôve already won two trophies this year, and on Saturday in Paris they have the chance to add a seventh European Cup.  Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti and Karim Benzema stand in the Reds‚Äô way in the Stade de France, on what promises to be a thrilling occasion. For Van Dijk it will be appearance No.51 of a gruelling campaign. Only three Liverpool players ‚Äì Jordan Henderson, Diogo Jota and goalkeeper Alisson Becker ‚Äì have played more games this season.¬† Remarkable really, given everything that happened last year, but Van Dijk‚Äôs recovery from that ruptured anterior cruciate ligament has been as impressive as Liverpool‚Äôs march to glory.  Standing ovation for Virgil van Dijk üëèLiverpool fans are glad to have him back ‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/6lyXfdBNQY Some players never fully recover from an injury like that, but he looks as good, if not better, than he did before. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt surprise me,‚Äù Reds captain Jordan Henderson tells GOAL. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a special player and, physically, he‚Äôs a monster, so I never had any doubts. ‚ÄúOf course, we missed him an awful lot, and it was a difficult time for him, but I knew he could come back and be the same, if not better and stronger. ‚ÄúInjuries are the worst part of football. You feel helpless, watching your team-mates and unable to do what you love. It‚Äôs really difficult. ‚ÄúBut Virgil has come through the other side and his performances this season show he‚Äôs not too bad, is he?!‚Äù Van Dijk himself says it took him ‚Äúthree or four months‚Äù to get back up to full speed, but his form since the turn of the year has been superb, and vital as Liverpool embarked upon a spectacular assault on four fronts.¬† ‚ÄúI feel very good now,‚Äù he told Rio Ferdinand‚Äôs Between the Lines show this week. ‚ÄúAnd the funny thing is I can get even better than I am now.‚Äù There is no doubt about the impact he has on Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side. With him in the team, there is a poise, a surety and a sense of organisation about Liverpool, all of which was sorely lacking last season, when injuries decimated their squad and left them, in Klopp‚Äôs words, ‚Äúon three wheels‚Äù for much of the campaign. Don‚Äôt believe him? Consider this: when the Reds faced Real Madrid in last season‚Äôs Champions League quarter-finals, their centre-back partnership was Nat Phillips and Ozan Kabak, with Ben Davies and Rhys Williams on the bench. Unsurprisingly, they lost 3-1 on aggregate. It should be different in Paris, where Klopp's toughest decision is who will partner Van Dijk.  Will it be Joel Matip or Ibrahima Konate, both of whom have enjoyed stellar campaigns? Joe Gomez, a key part of the 2019-20 title-winning side, must content himself with the role of fourth-choice. Liverpool conceded 42 Premier League goals last season, but that figure was reduced to 26 this time around, and in Van Dijk‚Äôs last 16 league starts, they shipped only six.  They have plenty of game-changers at Anfield, difference-makers and stars, but in terms of influence and importance, Van Dijk may eclipse even the likes of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Alisson Becker. He will arrive in Paris fresh, having shaken off a minor niggle picked up in the FA Cup final earlier this month.¬† He trained fully this week, and knows he will need to be at his best to compete with the likes of Benzema and Vinicius Jr. ‚ÄúMy body is definitely enjoying a little bit of rest,‚Äù he told liverpoolfc.com this week.  ‚ÄúAfter playing so many games, so many tense moments, I think getting a little knock was maybe a sign that my body needed to have a rest! ‚ÄúI feel absolutely fine now and looking forward to, hopefully, a special evening.‚Äù He insists he will not take nights like this for granted. He remembers those long, painful days in the gym, those months spent in Dubai working his way back to fitness. ""I was in a bad place,"" he admitted.  He won't forget the misery of watching Liverpool‚Äôs title defence unravel without him, or the torment of missing the Netherlands‚Äô Euro 2020 campaign. It hurt, but it makes what has happened since even sweeter. ‚ÄúTo win the Champions League [in 2019] was a dream come true,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd also to win it the year after we lost it [to Real in Kyiv] was special.¬† ‚ÄúBut this year could feel maybe a little bit more special because it is only my comeback season. That‚Äôs how I feel it.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/virgil-van-dijk-liverpool-most-important-player/bltace70b5cf3d719a6,Neil Jones,57d5b48c-d416-496f-b281-d326ca8ef981
Mata '100 per cent committed to playing' amid reports Man Utd midfielder could retire,"Juan Mata has insisted that he remains ""100 per cent committed to playing"" amid reports that the Manchester United midfielder could retire at the end of the season. Mata has enjoyed a stellar career at the highest level spanning across the last 16 years, starting out in Real Madrid's Castilla squad before going on to take in successful spells at Valencia and Chelsea. The Spain international has been on United's books since 2014 and has recorded 51 goals and 47 assists in 278 games for the club, but hasn't been a regular starter for quite some time. Mata's current contract is due to expire at the end of June and, although he is unlikely to be offered fresh terms, it has been reported that he is being groomed for a coaching role at Old Trafford. The midfielder, who turns 34 later this month, has been tipped to hang up his boots at the end of the season, but has now come out to set the record straight on his future. Mata has played down the notion that he could retire early and put more of his time into the growth of pledge-based charity 'Common Goal', which he set up in 2017. ‚ÄúOf course, I will be involved with Common Goal because that‚Äôs something that goes beyond football,‚Äù he told United's official website. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that will last for much longer and it will stay there after I stop and many members stop, but my mind is 100 per cent committed to playing.‚Äù Mata has been restricted to just five appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils in 2021-22, the last of which came from the bench in a Champions League round of 16 defeat to Atletico Madrid on March 15. Ralf Rangnick has favoured the likes of Fred, Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic in the middle of the park, but Mata still feels he has plenty to offer and hasn't given up on making a bigger contribution before the season ends. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been playing as much as I would like this season and I really miss it,‚Äù said the World Cup winner. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying training with my team-mates and I really want to show that I can enjoy playing and giving what I can give to the team. ‚ÄúI miss it and I still have a lot of passion and a lot of will to keep enjoying football. ‚ÄúThis is a dream come true to be a professional football player so I want to play as much as I can and I feel good, to be honest: mentally, physically, I am of course ready to perform, so hopefully soon.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mata-100-per-cent-committed-playing-reports-man-utd-retire/bltcb238f8e20056b2f,James Westwood,cc9677a6-371b-4f73-ba46-ea4443326d8b
Ancelotti is a traitor! Disgraced former Juventus director Moggi says Real Madrid coach was part of 'dirty football',"Former Juventus director Luciano Moggi has hit out at Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti for his recent claims about the Calciopoli scandal. Ancelotti, who managed Juve from 1999 to 2001, said this week that the match-fixing scandal that rocked Italian football in 2006 was actually a positive thing because it ""cleaned"" Italian football. Juve, AC Milan, Fiorentina and Reggina were all implicated, with the Turin side stripped of the 2004-05 Serie A title and relegated to Serie B. Moggi, who was found to be at the centre of the Calciopoli scandal, took to his column in Italian newspaper Il Libero to respond to the coach's comments. ‚ÄúDear Carlo, your claims make me think you forget about your time at Juventus and don‚Äôt realise that you are also reporting yourself,"" he wrote.  ""You were part of that ‚Äòdirty football‚Äô you enjoyed because it made you grow as a coach. ‚ÄúYou were part of that football also when Juventus lost the title under the rain in Perugia. You were part of that football when the FIGC changed the rules one week before Juventus vs Roma, giving the Giallorossi the chance to play with an extra-EU player, [Hidetoshi] Nakata, who hadn‚Äôt been allowed to play before. ‚ÄúHe was also decisive because he scored the equaliser that allowed Roma to win the title and you finished as a runner-up once again. ‚ÄúAt that time, you used to come to my office to complain about the injustice suffered by Juventus. I don‚Äôt understand why you condemn this behaviour now, just like traitors who take advantage of the dirty game to grow and then, with lights off, they make whistleblowers, but only to pass as do-gooders. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to fish in a barrel and it costs nothing unless you have something else to declare, only with proofs because phone tappings are ready to deny and Gianfelice Facchetti knows something about it."" The revelations of the Calciopoli scandal came in May 2006, as a series of telephone calls showed that there were close relations between Serie A team officials and refereeing organisations. Moggi was one of those convicted and sentenced to prison for his involvement in the affair. Moggi was given a lifetime ban from football and, in 2011, a court sentenced him to five years in prison. However, that sentence was eventually reduced and then cancelled due to the statute of limitations.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ancelotti-is-a-traitor-disgraced-former-juventus-director/bltc3d27f655729c2ce,Peter McVitie,4e982877-8242-46f3-b8f4-9d864a1f9048
Saka makes history as Arsenal hit 2000th Premier League goal milestone,"Arsenal attacker Bukayo Saka made history on Saturday with his goal in the Gunners' 1-0 Premier League win over Aston Villa. The young England international has gone from strength to strength this season and continues to impress even the neutrals. Manager Mikel Arteta has clearly placed his faith in Saka and it's safe to say he has delivered the goods this campaign as the club hit a milestone of goals scored in the English top flight.

Watch: De Gea looks absolutely devastated after Man Utd Champions League exit & makes vow to get club back to top,"A devastated David de Gea has vowed to help Manchester United ""fight for big trophies and big things"" once more after their Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. A 1-0 loss at Old Trafford delivered a 2-1 aggregate defeat to knock the Red Devils out of Europe and out of silverware contention once more, to make it five years without a trophy. But, while goalkeeper De Gea was left crestfallen, the Spain international says that he will help get them back to the summit of the game, at home and abroad. ""For myself, I feel very, very sad,"" he stated. ""The side in the dressing room feel the same. [It was a] tough night [with a] disappointing result. We keep trying, but it wasn't enough to beat them. ""They are a very good, defensive team. They scored the first goal, so it was difficult to create chances against them. To be honest, the team created today at least enough to score one goal. But they are a very experienced team, a very competitive team. ""It is a very difficult moment and very, very sad. We are not fighting for trophies, fighting for the Premier League, fighting for big things. It's another disappointing result. There's still nine finals to play, but we need to keep going. One day, this club is again going to be in the top position, fighting for big trophies and big things."" With their Champions League exit confirmed on Tuesday, the wait for silverware at Old Trafford will now stretch five full seasons, having last won a trophy in 2017. That year, they completed a trophy double, winning the League Cup final against Southampton and triumphing in the Europa League against Ajax, in Stockholm.

What will Robert Lewandowski‚Äôs shirt number be at Barcelona? Will Polish striker take No.9 after ‚Ç¨50m transfer?,"Robert Lewandowski is finally a Barcelona player, with the long-running saga seeing the prolific Poland international striker complete his transfer from Bayern Munich which could be worth as much as ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$51m). A modern day great spent eight memorable years in Germany, scoring 344 goals and winning 19 trophies, but he feels the time is right ‚Äì at 33 years of age ‚Äì to take on a new challenge. He will be expected to maintain impressive standards at Camp Nou, with his strike rate up there with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but what number will he have on his back when leading the line for the Liga giants? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Lewandowski has officially linked up with Barca during their pre-season tour of the United States, with Xavi‚Äôs side set for meetings with Inter Miami, Real Madrid, Juventus and New York Red Bulls while in America. Lewandowski will expect to see game time during those fixtures as he builds his way towards a competitive debut at the start of the 2022-23 campaign. As one of the greatest scorers of all time, the experienced frontman would be expected to lead the line as a No.9. He will, however, be requiring a favour from a new team-mate in order to make that possible, or for the man currently occupying his favoured jersey in the Blaugrana‚Äôs ranks to be involved in a transfer of his own during the summer window. ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI IS JOINING BARCELONA üí• pic.twitter.com/q86yi3BnT7 As things stand, Dutch forward Memphis Depay is Barca‚Äôs No.9 with that shirt taken on in the summer of 2021 before scoring 13 goals last season. There has been talk of the Netherlands international giving up his number to Lewandowski, while there are plenty of rumours to be found regarding a move elsewhere for the former Manchester United and Lyon star. If No.9 does not become available, then 11 is the lowest number up for grabs following Adama Traore‚Äôs return to Wolves at the end of a short-term loan ‚Äì and Lewandowski has donned that jersey before with Poland. Clement Lenglet‚Äôs move to Tottenham on an initial season-long loan, Pedri‚Äôs shift up the standings to No.8 and the departure of Luuk de Jong have freed up numbers 15, 16 and 17.

Erik ten Hag‚Äôs side will also line up against Sheriff and Omonoia in Group E, while Mikel Arteta will lead his troops into continental battle against Bodo/Glimt and FC Zurich in Group A. Elsewhere, Jose Mourinho‚Äôs Roma - who won the Europa Conference League last season - have been placed in Group C with Ludogorets, Real Betis and HJK Helsinki. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Manchester United‚Äôs last trophy triumph came in the Europa League back in 2016-17, when Mourinho was at their helm. Arsenal missed out on continental football entirely last season, but are now back in a competition they reached the final of in 2019. The group stage of the 2022-23 Europa League will get underway on September 8, with six matchdays taking those involved through to November 3. The knockout rounds begin in February 2023, with the final set to be held at the Puskas Arena in Budapest on May 31. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Manchester United have never previously faced a Moldovan opponent in European competition before. The only English club to do so, in fact, is Spurs, who faced Zimbru Chisinau in the 1999-00 UEFA Cup and Sheriff Tiraspol in the 2013-14 Europa League. Arsenal have won all six of their previous European meetings with Swiss opponents; it's the most they've ever faced sides from a particular nation in Europe while winning 100% of their matches. THE VERDICT: Here is what the full draw looks like‚Ä¶ Old rivalry rekindled... WHAT NEXT? Top-four finishes may be the priority for United and Arsenal in 2022-23, but both clubs are aware of the need to deliver tangible success and major silverware in the current campaign ‚Äì with an alternative route to Champions League qualification available to them.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/europa-league-2022-23-group-stage-draw-man-utd-real-sociedad/bltc757759998676e21,Chris Burton,64c8ded3-3565-485e-89c7-d37175b45eb3
Gabriel Jesus exclusive: Arsenal's new ¬£45m signing out to 'win everything' - but not become the new Thierry Henry,"All it took was one chat with Mikel Arteta and Gabriel Jesus‚Äô mind was made up. There were other possibilities, with several clubs in the mix for the Brazil international this summer, but his heart was set on a move to north London. For Jesus it was about trust, it was about the ongoing project at Arsenal and it was about the belief that his ambitions could be met at the Emirates Stadium. That‚Äôs why he swapped Manchester City for Arsenal in a ¬£45 million move, and as he prepares to make his Gunners debut on Friday evening in a pre-season friendly against Nurnberg, the 25-year-old spoke exclusively to GOAL to discuss exactly why a switch to Arsenal was so appealing. ‚ÄúIn my life, I always liked projects,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen Edu came to talk to me, I was so happy with the ideas of the club. The way they want to go, the things they want to do. ‚ÄúThen I was pretty sure I would come to Arsenal. But after I talked to Mikel, I was 100 per cent sure. Because I trust in him. Because I trust in this big club. And I trust in myself and the players as well. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of talent here. Very good players. And young players. Like me, I'm still young. So everyone is together in this. Like a family. That is what I want.‚Äù Time for Gabriel Jesus to make his mark üí• pic.twitter.com/tuGC5C082k Jesus added: ‚ÄúI have already worked with Mikel, so I I know his ideas a little bit. I know the way he wants to play. I think it is quite similar to Pep Guardiola and I think that fits well. I‚Äôve come to try to help the guys and I‚Äôll try to learn with them as well. As a family. ‚ÄúI am so happy with the group. It was good to see everyone when I joined the club for the first day. ‚ÄúIt is a big family here. We are going to play well, train well and at the end of the season, I am pretty sure, we are going to win something.‚Äù Winning something would be nothing new to Jesus. In fact, since he arrived in England from Brazil in January 2017, there are few players as decorated as the forward. He lifted the Premier League title on four separate occasions while he was with Guardiola‚Äôs side, while also claiming three League Cup winners medals during his time at the Etihad, as well as one FA Cup. Winning comes naturally to him, and it is why Arteta was so keen to bring him to Arsenal and have him as the central figure of his new-look attack. Jesus himself is adamant he wouldn‚Äôt have agreed to the move if he didn‚Äôt think he could add to his medal tally in north London. ‚ÄúFirst of all, [I need] to adapt,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdapt to the club, adapt with the players, the way they play and the way they are. After this, everything else will come naturally. This is football. Football is the same everywhere. ‚ÄúThen at the end of the season I want to win something. Win trophies. Like everybody here at Arsenal. That is the only way to make myself a name in the history of this big club. Jesus added: ‚ÄúIt is a big club with a big project. When Edu explained to me what they want for the future, I was so excited to join Arsenal because I love the project. ‚ÄúI want to win trophies. I want to win everything.‚Äù When he was growing up as a child in Sao Paulo, Jesus was unable to watch much European football. But when he did manage to catch any, there was one player who always stood out. Thierry Henry. Jesus grew up idolising the Frenchman, but as he now prepares to follow in his footsteps at Arsenal, the Brazilian wants to write his own success story at the club. ‚ÄúWhen you say Arsenal, you mean Thierry Henry,‚Äù said Jesus. ‚ÄúThierry is unique, he is one of the greatest players ever. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to be the new Thierry Henry. I want to make myself a name in this club‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúI will be there: 90 minutes per game in the box, trying to score, trying to help. Not only with goals, also with assists. Covering the ball. Running, in my style. Never stop. ""Helping my team, helping my team-mates. Yeah, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gabriel-jesus-exclusive-arsenal-45m-signing-win-everything/blt10c0cece0584cb42,Sebastian Mittag and Charles Watts,6dee6fb2-98f3-4a1b-8e5b-2e30b126c4e1
Lookman in awe of Leicester City‚Äôs performance against Crystal Palace,"Ademola Lookman is gushing over Leicester City‚Äôs 2-1 triumph over Crystal Palace in Sunday‚Äôs Premier League fixture. Unbeaten in their last three matches in all competitions, the Foxes welcomed the Selhurst Park outfit to the King Power Stadium - as they craved to extend their impressive form. In the keenly contested affair, Brendan Rodgers‚Äô men took the lead in the 39th minute after Lookman converted Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall‚Äôs assist. The RB Leipzig loanee, in the process, equalled his best tally in a league campaign. On the stroke of half time, Dewsbury-Hall extended the lead as the hosts went into the half-time break with a two-goal advantage. Although Wilfried Zaha pulled a goal back for the visitors in the 66th minute, Leicester secured all three points to move up to ninth. Reflecting on the result, the former Englan youth international player praised his side‚Äôs showing, particularly in the first 45 minutes. ‚ÄúIt was a very strong performance against a strong opposition,‚Äù Lookman told Leicester City TV. ‚ÄúFrom us, the unit, togetherness, all the qualities were there today. I think we battled hard, especially in the first half, and I feel like we dominated a lot more. ‚ÄúBut in the second half, coming out, they put the pressure on us and obviously they got the penalty, but I think after that we showed resilience and we stayed together, and we won the game. That‚Äôs the most important thing.‚Äù The 24-year-old also hailed academy graduate Dewsbury-Hal for his starring role against Patrick Vieira‚Äôs side.¬† ‚ÄúI knew he was going to pass the ball inside,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo, I just made a run and took it well. I think the one where Patson [Daka] passed it to me, and I could score there and make it 3-0 and then obviously we see the game out. It‚Äôs just those fine details. ¬†‚ÄúDewsbury-Hall is an amazing player. His energy, his tenacity is what we need and he‚Äôs very valuable to the squad, to us, and also not just as a player, but as a person as well. He‚Äôs a cool guy and I get along with him very well.‚Äù Leicester City square up against Newcastle United on April 17.

Odegaard and Partey ensure perfect start to Arsenal's season-defining week,"Match statistics: Arsenal 2-0 Leicester City One down, two to go. This was always going to be a huge week for Arsenal in their hunt for a top-four spot, with Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side facing three massive games in the space of just six days. After what many had considered a favourable run of fixtures, this week was the one that many had been waiting for. Leicester City, Liverpool and then Aston Villa all lay in wait for Arteta‚Äôs young guns, with those still harbouring doubts about the Gunners' Champions League credentials believing they could be found wanting. But they passed the first test on Sunday, cruising to a 2-0 win against a Leicester side who arrived at the Emirates Stadium on the back of four successive wins in all competitions.¬† And while there were a few nervy moments, it was, in truth, a relatively comfortable victory for Arteta‚Äôs side. Having seen Manchester United beat Tottenham on Saturday, Arsenal knew they needed a win to move back into that all important fourth spot in the Premier League. And after an early goal from the exceptional Thomas Partey - his second since arriving from Atletico Madrid - they secured the three points they needed thanks to a second-half penalty from Alexandre Lacazette. It was the start to the week that Arteta would have been dreaming of, and it sets Arsenal up perfectly for Wednesday‚Äôs home game against Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side might arrive in north London still dreaming of the title, but not even they can match the current run of form that Arsenal are on, with nine wins from their last 11 Premier League games. Belief is now brimming through this Arsenal team, with Partey and Martin Odegaard epitomising their impressive form. Both were superb against Leicester, with Partey now showing on a regular basis the sort of form that was expected of him when he was brought in from Atletico in the summer of 2020. He was named Arsenal‚Äôs Player of the Month for February in the build-up to Sunday‚Äôs game, and it would be no surprise to see him bag the award in March as well, such has been the level of his recent performances. He will no doubt, though, be going head to head with Odegaard when the poll does open, with the Norway international continuing to go from strength to strength. If Partey is the enforcer in the Arsenal midfield right now, Odegaard is the artist. It felt like he had the ball glued to his feet at times against Leicester as he toyed with the visitors‚Äô throughout 90 exceptional minutes. The ex-Real Madrid man wasted no time in picking up where he left off against Watford last weekend. One clever pass from the Norwegian sent Gabriel Martinelli through in the early stages. And although his shot was saved by Kasper Schmeichel, it was an early warning for Leicester. It was no surprise to see Arsenal break the deadlock soon after, when Partey rose highest to head home Martinelli‚Äôs corner. It was the perfect start for Arteta‚Äôs side, and things could have got even better had Partey‚Äôs shot from the edge of the box not come back off the crossbar. Arsenal were playing like a side who had won eight of their last 10 Premier League games, but as is often the way with a young side, they could not maintain their fast start, and Leicester started to grow into the game. Harvey Barnes had already had one effort kept out by Aaron Ramsdale before he glanced Marc Alrbrighton‚Äôs ball in towards the far corner. Brendan Rodgers was already celebrating the equaliser on the touchline, only for Ramsdale to somehow get his hand to the ball and touch it wide for a corner. Rodgers‚Äô expression as he turned to the Leicester bench told its own story. ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù he said. Half-time came at a good time for Arsenal, and they started the second half on the front foot, with the second goal arriving just before the hour mark. It came via a penalty after a VAR check ruled that Caglar Soyuncu had handled Partey‚Äôs close-range header, with Lacazette burying his spot kick past Schmeichel. There was no way back for Leicester after that, with Arsenal cruising through the remainder of the game unscathed. Tougher tests are no doubt on the way, starting against Liverpool. But Arteta‚Äôs side will fancy their chances against anyone right now. Many felt this would be the week they could be found wanting in their pursuit of the Champions League.¬† They way they have started it, however, suggests they could be ready to prove a point.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/odegaard-partey-perfect-start-arsenal-season-defining-week/blt732a9f368c5618a8,Charles Watts,edaba2e5-f674-4fd1-b5e9-c0b5bbe0ff72
Bellerin shows off new tattoo inked at Real Betis' home as on-loan Arsenal star pushes to stay at Liga club,"Hector Bellerin has added to his tattoo collection, going under the needle on the turf of Betis' Estadio Benito Villamarin home. The Arsenal defender is keen to stay at the Spanish club after enjoying a fruitful year back in La Liga on loan in 2021-22. His season finished on a high note when Betis took the Copa del Rey title after downing Valencia in the final. ""Talegos tattoo told me that they would do my tattoo in my favourite place,"" Bellerin wrote on Instagram as he showed off his new work. The accompanying video revealed the 27-year-old looking as happy as anyone could be with a needle in their arm, sat down on the Benito Villamarin pitch while the artist did his work. And the message of the tattoo could not be clearer, professing that: ""In this game, those who have the best time win."" The defender's loan move came as a huge boost after a succession of serious injuries caused him to lose ground at Arsenal over the past few seasons. Bellerin racked up more than 30 appearances for the Seville side, the first time he has broken that mark since the 2017-18 campaign, while also helping Betis to their first silverware since the 2004-05 Copa del Rey. ""I have always shown that I feel really at home here and I want to be here, but it is not that simple,"" he admitted in a recent interview with Betis TV. ""Right now the situation is that I have to go back [to Arsenal]. I have spoken to both clubs, made my thoughts clear and from there we have two months in which we will try to make the best deal for all three parties. ""I have always said it, I made an effort to come here and I am willing to do anything to have this continue to be my home because I am happy.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bellerin-shows-off-new-tattoo-inked-at-real-betis-home-as-on/blt674f5162c840ca12,Daniel Edwards,1c5341de-c94d-466e-bc39-d350e202b6ea
"'He looked like prime Welbeck at the Bernabeu!' - Man Utd should re-sign Brighton striker to fill in for Ronaldo, says Ferdinand","Rio Ferdinand has suggested Manchester United should look to one of their former players to solve their attacking issues following their nightmare start to the 2022-23 campaign. The ex-United defender was, like many others at Old Trafford on Sunday, impressed by the performance of Brighton's Danny Welbeck as the visitors ran out 2-1 winners. And Ferdinand has now expressed his belief that the Seagulls forward could make an impact as a foil for Cristiano Ronaldo. Welbeck scored 29 goals in 142 appearances during his six-year spell in United's senior ranks before joining Arsenal in 2014, and has spent the last two years of his career at Brighton. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand said of a potential return to Old Trafford for his old team-mate: ""Danny Welbeck starts for Man United today [Sunday] in this game. ""Welbeck walked out of that tunnel and you could see, shoulders back, chest out, thinking ‚Äì ‚ÄòI will terrorize these two [Martinez and Maguire]‚Äô. ""That‚Äôs how he played today, he looked like prime-time Danny Welbeck at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid 10 years ago. Leading the charge. üî• @DannyWelbeck üîã pic.twitter.com/aOmdB16bnP ""On today‚Äôs performance, no doubt. If you want a back-up striker, you wouldn‚Äôt go far wrong with Danny Welbeck. ""Say to him, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre going to play 15/20 games over the season, fill in for Cristiano‚Äô. It gives us the legs, gives us the movement ‚Äì the running behind defenders like he did today and it frees up the space for the likes of Bruno [Fernandes]."" There have been no concrete links between United and Welbeck this summer, but manager Erik ten Hag still appears to be on the hunt for new players. Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot is the latest to be linked with a move to Old Trafford, while former Stoke man Marko Arnautovic, now of Bologna, emerged as a target following the Brighton defeat. Meanwhile, the saga surrounding Frenkie de Jong at Barcelona is still ongoing, with Chelsea also reportedly interested in the Dutch midfielder.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/prime-welbeck-bernabeu-man-utd-should-sign-brighton-striker-fill-/blt4eec06795e13fa55,Callum Rice-Coates,a870ce51-a3b2-4bf1-95b2-f8ab164b45c3
Newcastle face backlash as 'leaked' Saudi Arabia-style away kit attracts criticism,"Newcastle United will reportedly be taking inspiration from their Saudi Arabian owners next season, with the Daily Mail claiming the Magpies‚Äô away kit for 2022-23 will be a green and white design. The Premier League outfit work with Castore ‚Äì a company in which tennis superstar Sir Andy Murray owns a stake ‚Äì for their kits. The first year of that partnership has seen the Tyneside team in a black and gold kit on their travels, with light blue as a third kit, but there is seemingly a Middle Eastern theme in production for the club‚Äôs next top-flight campaign. Reports claim that Newcastle‚Äôs change strip for next season will carry the colours of the Saudi Arabian flag. The Daily Mail article says: ‚ÄúNewcastle's crest, as well as the trim of the neck and sleeves, have been coloured green on an all-white backdrop, bearing a striking resemblance to the shirt of the Saudi national team.‚Äù Leaked images of the supposed new design do not include a main sponsor as the Magpies‚Äô new owners are said to have ended an agreement with online Chinese gaming operator Fun88. The leaked design has been greeted with a mixed response from Magpies supporters on social media, although no confirmation from the club regarding their kit plans for 2022-23 has been released. They can however expect criticism from opponents of their ownership if they follow a Saudi Arabian theme. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) completed a ¬£300 million ($366m) takeover of Newcastle in October 2021, with an 80 per cent controlling stake in the club acquired. Ambitious plans for the future were immediately laid out, as Steve Bruce was quickly replaced as manager by Eddie Howe, and Newcastle were European football‚Äôs biggest spenders during the January transfer window. PIF had to prove when completing the Premier League‚Äôs Owners‚Äô and Directors‚Äô Test that it has no connection to the Saudi state, with serious human rights issues in that region attracting criticism from those accusing Newcastle and the Premier League of ‚Äúsportswashing‚Äù.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/newcastle-leaked-new-saudi-arabia-away-kit/blt426f7590b83a3ae9,Chris Burton,67823e4c-40e6-48fd-a60a-8db4d8cecf10
"'This is my home, but we need change' - Texas-raised Cannon proud to be part of USMNT's push against gun violence in wake of Uvalde shooting","Texas-raised U.S. men's national team star Reggie Cannon says that his home is in need of big changes as the fullback reflected on the recent shooting in Uvalde. A total of 19 children and two adults were killed at a school shooting in Uvalde on May 24, with the Texas city just a few hours away from Cannon's hometown of Grapevine. In the wake of that shooting and the several others that have occurred across the U.S. in recent weeks, the USMNT put out an open letter to Congress demanding action in the fight to prevent gun violence. Today we are sending this letter to every member of Congress pleading with them to act and help end gun violence. #BetheChange #DontLookAway pic.twitter.com/KWb5Eb1Z0K Cannon, who last week discussed the frustration at having to speak to his European teammates about the frequent shootings in his home country, revealed that his return to Texas this week is a somber one. The fullback is part of the team in Austin following friendlies against Morocco and Uruguay, with the U.S. set to host Grenada on Friday to kickstart the CONCACAF Nations League. But a trip that could have felt like a homecoming now feels a bit different given the events of recent weeks. ""It's always difficult coming back to Texas, especially given the circumstances,"" Cannon said. ""I would never take it for granted. This is my home, but I think it's also realistic to say that there is a need for change and I think that's what this group has been focused on, especially with the mantra 'Be the change' and especially with that letter sent the other day that we all contributed to. ""It is time for sincere change and I think it's always kind of a heartbreaker to be in this place and see the problems, especially being in Europe and always having to explain to my teammates that this is reality.

History in the making as all-transgender team TRUK United face Dulwich Hamlet Women in first for English football,"On Thursday, March 31, 2022, as most English fans are impatiently waiting for the Premier League to return after the international break, football history will be made at Champion Hill. At the non-league stadium in south London, Dulwich Hamlet Women will be taking on TRUK United FC in a friendly match. The date is appropriate, as it coincides with Transgender Day of Visibility [TDoV], and TRUK United are a charity team offshoot from Trans Radio UK. TRUK United are a team entirely made up of transgender women, and this will be the first time such a side has played a game in British football. They have tough opposition for the occasion, too ‚Äì a semi-professional side from the fifth tier of the English game. For Paula Griffin, a player for TRUK United and a volunteer at Dulwich Hamlet for more than three decades, this game represents both a labour of love and a dream come true. Speaking exclusively to GOAL, she says: ""I spoke to Lucy Clark [founder of TRUK], and said this might be a game we were able to arrange during the season. ""It's taken a while to get to this stage. We were trying to look for a good date but league fixtures were being moved around. But we managed to get a date which worked well, with it being TDoV. ""I have been overwhelmed by the support the Dulwich Hamlet players and management have given to this game. ""I've been involved with the club for 30 years and been involved with all sorts of jobs ‚Äì I've run the club website, I've been on the committee, run the charity trust. ""The club has supported me so much over recent years ‚Äì I've had cancer, I've come out as a transgender woman ‚Äì and the support and acceptance from this club, it makes me emotional to talk about it. ""Everyone has accepted me as myself, so to be able to put on a game like this... the experience has been overwhelming."" There is immense excitement from the Dulwich Hamlet side, too, with the club having established itself as one of the most liberal and inclusive on the English football pyramid. On March 31st will be taking part in an historic match at Champion Hill as @DHFC_W face @Trukunitedfc raising funds for the amazing @TRUKListens providing support to the transgender community.

The New York-born player, who has played for Dulwich Hamlet for the last seven years, tells GOAL: ""I was the first player to catch wind that we were participating in this, and it was really exciting.  ""To play devil's advocate, it will be difficult given how our scheduling is, but it is really exciting. Our club stands for inclusivity in sport, and especially standing with women in sport."" Team-mate and centre-back Ceylon Hickman agrees, and says the game can go a long way towards promoting LGBT+ inclusion and acceptance in sport, something she is passionate about through working in her day job for charity Football Beyond Borders. She says: ""I am super excited for this game, it is history-making. It is a privileged moment to play in a game that is breaking boundaries, and setting a path for how football should go.  ""I work with schools around the country, children who are passionate about football. I'm currently working with a school near Dulwich and I am doing everything I can to get the kids at the game. ""It would be their first live football match and it is the perfect game to introduce them with, as it represents everything we stand for at Dulwich."" The friendly arrives amid a renewed focus on the place of transgender people within sport, in particular trans women, from the debate over Lia Thomas competing in the NCAA Swimming Championships, to the recent suspension of an 'LGBT-inclusive' five-a-side league in London over its adherence to the FA's ""archaic"" rules on trans players. For Elmore, as a cisgender female football player, she is proud to try and lead the way by showing that concerns over the future of women's sport is little more than a moral panic. She says: ""I know it's a hot topic, but I feel there needs to be more normalcy on women playing football. I hate this stigma, this barrier that women cannot be themselves and play the sport that they love. I hope this match shines a light on that.  In celebration of the fact that our game is for everyone, Trans Radio football club will be making their debut at Champion Hill in a special invitational match against our very own Dulwich Hamlet women‚Äôs team on 31/3/22‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/QsrTISeoXc #DHFC pic.twitter.com/ghXyKkElZV ""It's a tough conversation to have as a cisgender woman. All we can do is support and give a safe space, using our platform as best we can to normalise all women playing football. ""I don't want to downplay it but, from my perspective, I want it to be a normal football match. I know it isn't, for so many reasons, but it's a friendly match against another team of women, and that should draw a crowd regardless. ""Everyone I have spoken to has been really positive. Having pro-trans conversations, just like anti-racism and anti-sexism conversations, are part of our club. It feels really natural to be part of a historic match which hopefully isn't historic for very long. ""I hate that there is a perception around this. We are trying to normalise this and I hate that in 2022 this still has to be a conversation.  ""Recently, there has been a lot of negativity around trans women competing against cis women in sport, and hopefully this can break down some of those barriers."" Hickman feels the negativity towards trans women in sport is an offshoot of misogynistic attitudes towards women in football generally, citing the historic and current comparative lack of funding and media coverage of their game compared to the men's sport She says: ""It is frustrating that we have to have these conversations where you have to actively shift people's perceptions. There are systems and structures in our world which make trans women some of the most persecuted people in western society.  ""What football is to me and so many others is a space of radical acceptance, it's a feeling of belonging, where you can let go and forget about the rest of your life for 90 minutes. Anyone should be able to experience that. ""The men's game is such a reflection of society, as a hetero-dominated culture, and what is beautiful about the women's game, there is this overriding sense of being a minority in the game, so you have this sense of solidarity and camaraderie. Trans women are no different, they should be in that space. ""You have to work harder to include trans women in that space, and Thursday is an active attempt to make that happen.  ""It will be a really powerful coming together of allied forces, and hopefully providing a blueprint for what football can be. All we can keep doing is knocking on the door, because that's what women's football can do."" Griffin is aware that one friendly will not do much on its own to shift attitudes, and the reaction she has got within Dulwich Hamlet fans while promoting the game as a volunteer has been notably mixed ‚Äì but that the only way to change minds is to be as visible and vocal as possible. She says: ""I've had a very interesting reaction ‚Äì at the last home Dulwich game I was handing out flyers about the match, and there was a difference in reaction. ""On the whole, female supporters were very positive, saying they will be there, while male supporters... you say those two things, women's sport and transgender people in sport, and they take a step back. There was that inkling of reticence, and I definitely saw that on a gender basis. ""There's a long way to go, but if we start chipping away little by little we can make a difference.  ""I'm so hopeful this can be a starting point to get away from the sh*t we are seeing around the coverage of Lia Thomas, the misrepresented photographs and stuff like that, which we have to fight against as grassroots footballers, to let them hear our voices and I think we can really start to make a change in our game."" TRUK have managed to put together a surprisingly bulky squad of 21 players, considering the dearth of trans players at any sort of competitive level in UK football, with a couple of notable names, including semi-pro goalkeeper Blair Hamilton and former Watford academy player Sammy Walker. However, they will certainly start as underdogs against a semi-pro Dulwich Hamlet side, although Griffin is quietly confident of a respectable result, predicting a 3-3 draw while Elmore and Hickman go for a 3-1 victory to Hamlet. Griffin says: ""We have a good range of players with a wide range of experience from all over the country.  ""Sammy, if she's fit ‚Äì if not, we'll get her on the pitch on a stretcher as she's brilliant ‚Äì is our skipper. We have Blair in goal, she plays for Hastings and is an excellent keeper. Then there's myself, the ultimate utility player ‚Äì useless in every position. ""It's difficult to prepare, as a lot of our players are training with their own teams. From a personal point of view, I train with Goal Diggers FC, others might be coming in a bit cold. Hopefully, we'll get in a good warm-up and, of course, we are wanting to allow all the players to play. ""As a game, it has that thing with trans women in sport ‚Äì it's a Catch-22: if we lose, it's a joke; if we win, it's because we have this supposed physical advantage. I'm hoping for a high-scoring draw to keep everyone happy!"" The amateur side may be doing well to grab a result, though, as the semi-pro outfit will not be taking it easy. ""I sadly can't play in this, but we will approach this like every other match,"" says Elmore. ""We want to win and we'll take no prisoners. We're a competitive bunch, we don't step onto a pitch unless we are going out to win.""

"Chukwuemeka, Garnacho & the 31 NXGN wonderkids who could become Premier League stars","The Premier League is back, and that means that clubs up and down the country are looking for new heroes who can help make their dreams come true. Naturally, most eyes will be on big-money summer signings, but there is nothing better than when a teenager breaks into the first team and makes an instant impact. We've asked our friends at NXGN to help us pick out the most likely players born in 2003 or later to make that leap in 2022-23. This time last season, they correctly predicted that Anthony Elanga, Harvey Elliott and Tino Livramento were set for breakout seasons, so keep an eye out for these names in the coming weeks and months..",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/chukwuemeka-garnacho-nxgn-wonderkids-premier-league-2022-23/blt29dc00a7eb801763,Tom Maston,1176de01-870c-4000-9343-098a1b6ecdfd
Pedri injury update: Barcelona midfielder exits Europa League match with hamstring discomfort,"Pedri has exited Barcelona's Europa League quarter-final match against Eintracht Frankfurt with a hamstring injury, the club has announced. He was replaced by Frenkie de Jong in the second half with the Blaugrana trailing 3-1 on aggregate. The 19-year-old was sidelined for an extended period earlier this year with a hamstring problem. The manager was brief in his statement about Pedri to reporters but expressed significant worry. ""Pedri worries me, let's see what he has,"" he said. ""It's very bad news."" Pedri's workload in 2021 was the subject of debate among fans and pundits, as he was one of the most often used players in Europe between his time at Barcelona as well as appearances at the Euros and Olympics with the Spanish national team. He's been less active this term simply because of his recurrent hamstring problems and has missed more matches than he has been available for. He will undergo further testing this week to determine the severity of this latest injury.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pedri-injury-update-barcelona-midfielder-exits-europa-league/blte49db8897025746e,Dan Bernstein,ea80f486-3568-461a-9eb8-0adf82fed92b
Forget Vlahovic: Arsenal's true transfer priority exposed by FA Cup catastrophe at Nottingham Forest,"All the talk at Arsenal right now has centred around the speculation linking Dusan Vlahovic with a big money move to north London. But while there is no doubt the Gunners do need to add a prolific striker to their squad if they want to close the gap to the Premier League‚Äôs elite sides, the embarrassing FA Cup defeat at Nottingham Forest highlighted their most pressing need during the January transfer window. Mikel Arteta‚Äôs options in midfield are threadbare right now, and it is there where the Arsenal boss, along with technical director Edu, must focus their attention during the coming weeks. ‚ÄúI want to try to get the best out of the players we have,‚Äù Arteta said after Sunday‚Äôs 1-0 loss at the City Ground. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear where we need to strengthen, but at the moment it‚Äôs what we have and what we have has to play.‚Äù With Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny both away at the Africa Cup of Nations throughout January, this was always going to be a month that stretched Arteta‚Äôs midfield options to the limit. But the issue was exacerbated against Forest as Granit Xhaka missed out due to a positive Covid-19 test just days after the decision was made to let Ainsley Maitland-Niles leave on loan to Roma. Had Maitland-Niles still been around, the 24-year-old would surely have started at the City Ground, but Arsenal opted to let the England international make the move to Italy before the game. With Partey and Elneny already absent, it seemed like a risky decision to let the Hale End graduate go so early in the window - but Roma were adamant they wanted the deal done now, rather than at the end of the month. ‚ÄúWe are very, very short at the moment, but this cannot be the only argument to try to keep a player,‚Äù Arteta explained in the build-up to the Forest game, when giving the reasons for Maitland-Niles‚Äô departure. ‚ÄúAinsley came to me and explained the reasons why he thought that the best thing for him in his career right now is to move away. ‚ÄúWe already had this conversation in the summer and we decided to keep him at the club and assess the situation in December, but with the amount of minutes that he has played, he‚Äôs entitled to that opportunity. ‚ÄúAnd when a player feels that way and has a strong argument like he has, it‚Äôs very difficult to turn it away, so we decided to let him go."" While that may be a noble stance on Arteta‚Äôs and Arsenal‚Äôs part, there is no doubt that the decision has left the Gunners very light when it comes to central midfield. The absence of Partey and Elneny was always going to create problems, but the sudden loss of Xhaka has made things even more difficult. It is unclear when the Switzerland international will be cleared to return, but with games against Liverpool and Tottenham to come this week, Arteta will be keeping everything crossed that he gets the green light to feature. ‚ÄúIt will depend on the next few games and how he‚Äôs feeling,‚Äù Arteta said, when pressed on the subject after Arsenal exited the FA Cup at the third round stage for only the second time in 25 years. Should Xhaka not return in time for Thursday night‚Äôs Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, then Arteta could be forced once again to go with a central midfield of Sambi Lokonga and teenager Charlie Patino against Liverpool. The latter was handed his first ever senior start on Sunday and it was understandably a very difficult evening for the 18-year-old. Patino‚Äôs potential cannot be questioned, but throwing a player so young into an already depleted side was always going to leave him with an uphill task. He needed an experienced head alongside him, but in Lokonga he had a player who had barely played any football in the past six weeks. Arsenal‚Äôs summer signing from Anderlecht looked rusty, and that left Arteta‚Äôs side exposed in central midfield. The visitors were unable to get any sort of control in the middle of the park and from early on it looked clear that the only way they were going to score was through a moment of individual quality from the forwards. That never materialised, however, and Arsenal were deservedly beaten, with Arteta‚Äôs side failing to muster a single shot on target. ùôíùôùùô§ ùôöùô°ùô®ùôö ùô¨ùô§ùô™ùô°ùôô ùôûùô© ùôùùôñùô´ùôö ùôóùôöùôöùô£ ü§©Lewis Grabban delivers in the big moments @NFFC üí™#EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/GpRlraxden ‚ÄúWe are going to look for options, because we are very short,‚Äù Arteta admitted when discussing the future of his midfield. ‚ÄúWe are going to move. ‚ÄúI think with the amount of things and the way that we want to evolve the squad we have to maximise every window in many different ways and we are alert ‚ÄúEdu and his team are working very hard as we know exactly what we need to do. Whether we can accomplish that in January or in the summer is a different question, as it is related to other stuff.‚Äù The issue for Arsenal, however, is they cannot really afford to wait until the summer to bring in a midfield reinforcement. Even when Partey and Elneny return, they still look short in the middle of the park. The Gunners have given themselves a real chance of achieving a top-four spot in the Premier League this season, securing themselves a long-awaited return to the Champions League. So to weaken themselves now - which they have by allowing Maitland-Niles to leave - would be bordering on criminal. The priority is clear and that was highlighted perfectly by events in Nottingham on Sunday night. There is still time for Arteta and Edu to fix the issue, and the club showed with their recruitment in the summer of 2021 that they can be smart when it comes to the transfer market. But they must act now or they risk undoing a lot of the good work that has gone on during the past few months.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-transfer-priority-exposed-fa-cup-catastrophe/bltb7c63fec1821a5b2,Charles Watts,af39fc15-af1a-4715-8229-b71dcf6a1014
‚ÄòDisrespectful!‚Äô - Bayern Munich‚Äôs Kane comments annoy Conte as Spurs boss reacts to transfer talk,"Tottenham head coach Antonio Conte has hit back at Bayern Munich over their ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù comments regarding Harry Kane, with the German giants considered to have acted out of line when speculating on potential interest in the England captain. Spurs have no intention of parting with their talismanic striker and have grown accustomed to fending off any admiring glances shot in his direction. They are, however, disappointed that the reigning Bundesliga champions have been openly discussing a prolific 28-year-old frontman as they look to line up potential replacements for Robert Lewandowski at the Allianz Arena. Bayern manager Julian Nagelsmann and club CEO Oliver Kahn have both admitted that Kane would hold obvious appeal in the transfer market, leading Conte to get a little agitated. He has said when biting back at European rivals: ‚ÄúHonestly I didn't hear this. For sure I'm a coach who doesn't talk about players from other teams. ‚ÄúI don't know why [this happened]. The situation at Tottenham is very clear. The plan is very clear with the club. Harry is a part of the project. He is a very important part of the project and yeah only rumours. ‚ÄúAt the same time, I don't like to speak about players from another club. If I want to do something I go to speak to the club, not through the media. ‚ÄúI think maybe it's a bit disrespectful for the other club. This is my way. This is my way to face the situation with other players.‚Äù Tottenham defender Eric Dier has added to Sky Sports on the renewed speculation surrounding Kane: ‚ÄúThat's normal. Every world-class player is always going to be spoken about a lot. I don't really care. ‚ÄúIn football you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow let alone next week so it's not something I'm bothered about, it's normal that world-class players are spoken about.‚Äù It is no secret that Bayern lack a proven No.9 after selling Lewandowski to Barcelona, and that has led Nagelsmann to say of Kane: ‚ÄúHe's very expensive that's the problem - but a brilliant player. ‚Äú[He's] one of the best forwards. [He's] perhaps one of two or three who can play as a centre forward [as well as a] No.10, but he's very strong, brilliant with [his] head and both feet. ‚ÄúHe could score a lot in the Bundesliga, I don't know the price, but it's really tough for Bayern Munich. We'll see what happens in the future.‚Äù Kahn added: ‚ÄúHe [Kane] is under contract with Tottenham. ‚ÄúSure, an absolute top striker, but that's all a dream of the future. ‚ÄúNow we have to look at getting the squad together for the current season. So let's see what else happens.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/disrespectful-bayern-munich-kane-comments-annoy-conte-spurs/bltc9651a6d154a7862,Chris Burton,f7d08bf5-f589-4d2e-beff-6a9db99d334a
Lingard at 10 & Bale over Hazard: Newcastle fantasy XI compiled by club legend Rob Lee,"Roughly 3,476,532 players have been linked with a move to Newcastle United since a ¬£300 million ($399m) takeover by a Saudi-led consortium was completed at St James‚Äô Park in October, with the expectation being that the Magpies will look to spend big in January. Attempting to sort the probable and possible from the speculative and silly has become a rather thankless task on Tyneside, with an excited fan base waiting to discover whether there really is any substance to the endless rounds of rumours. With so much gossip to wade through, GOAL caught up with former midfielder Rob Lee ‚Äì who was speaking in association with Coffee Friend ‚Äì to piece together a fantasy XI that could take to the field once the next window has slammed shut and if money really does prove to be no object for new owners in the North East.  Here is what a club legend had to say‚Ä¶ Players linked: Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona), Dean Henderson (Manchester United) Selection: ‚Äú[Martin] Dubravka has come back from injury, before that he was exceptional. Is it essential to change the goalkeeper at this moment in time? I don‚Äôt think so. If you want to change him, then maybe it will be the summer transfer window.  ""I think Dubravka is a good goalkeeper. He‚Äôs made a couple of mistakes recently, but he‚Äôs been out a long time. Before that he was an exceptional keeper, and still is. I wouldn‚Äôt change him at the minute.‚Äù Would it be worth taking Henderson on loan? ‚ÄúIt depends if I want to waste all my loans up, because you can only have a certain amount. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs essential, and he‚Äôs not an essential player that we need at the moment. In terms of a keeper, that‚Äôs the last place that I would look to strengthen, but Henderson would be one I would look at.‚Äù Players linked: Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid), Max Aarons (Norwich City) Selection: ‚ÄúTrippier I‚Äôd love, I think he‚Äôd be great. I think he would be very good and you could probably get him as well. I think he‚Äôd come and he‚Äôd get the area, get the people. Max Aarons? I think so. James Justin as well I would chuck in. He was at Luton with my lads and could play left or right. Whether you‚Äôd get him out of Leicester or not, I‚Äôm not sure. Before he got injured, I think he was on the verge of an England call up ‚Äì at left-back or right-back, he‚Äôs that good. Trippier would be my first choice, if I could get him straight away, and then maybe later on go for Aarons or James Justin to back him up. Is Trippier the best choice because he‚Äôs a northern lad?  ‚ÄúExactly. It‚Äôs alright chucking money at players, but you want to get players that know Newcastle and the Premier League. He would fit that category. He would know how big Newcastle are, know the area, and I think he‚Äôd love playing for Newcastle. The fans would love him.‚Äù Players linked: Oleksandr Zinchenko (Manchester City), Nathan Ake (Manchester City) Selection: ‚ÄúAke I would try and get. Eddie took him to Bournemouth so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if we went for him. He‚Äôs quick, not the biggest as a centre-back but can play, defend. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. If Man City wanted to get rid of him, I can see Eddie Howe trying to get him. He can play in a three at centre-half, he can play left-back. He‚Äôs versatile. I‚Äôve watched him since he was a kid at Chelsea and he‚Äôs a very good player. I was surprised when he went to Man City. To be honest, I thought that wasn‚Äôt a great move for him, but I suppose money talks and winning championships talks. He‚Äôs one that I think is possible and I would try to get him.‚Äù Players linked: Conor Coady (Wolves), James Tarkowski (Burnley), Kalidou Koulibaly (Napoli), Clement Lenglet (Barcelona) Selection: ‚ÄúCoady I really like. He‚Äôs an organiser, I like him. He‚Äôs a Scouser so he‚Äôd get the club and what it is. Tarkowski, I saw him on Saturday [in a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle] and he didn‚Äôt play great. He‚Äôs just come back from a suspension, but those two are both in England squads and know the Premier League. They are players that I would definitely try and get. Tarkowski‚Äôs contract is up at the end of the season so you‚Äôre probably more likely to get him, but unless you go in for Coady then you never know. I think these are feasible and would fit in.‚Äù Is there a role for current club captain Jamaal Lascelles?  ‚ÄúOn current form, probably not. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs a bad player but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs played well. He did well on Saturday but a few games before he hasn‚Äôt. I think he has to improve. Maybe it‚Äôs because he has no competition ‚Äì if he‚Äôs fit, he plays. If you have got Coady there and Tarkowski there, he might not play. Up your game or off you go. I don‚Äôt see Lascelles being the leader you would want. Coady, you see him at Wolves and he would be my sort of captain.‚Äù Players linked: Axel Witsel (Borussia Dortmund), Luka Modric (Real Madrid), Dele Alli (Tottenham), Aaron Ramsey (Juventus), Philippe Coutinho (Barcelona), Ross Barkley (Chelsea), Jesse Lingard (Manchester United) Selection: ‚ÄúI think technically [Jonjo] Shelvey is very good. It‚Äôs whether you can get him to run around and press like he has to do. Eddie wants to press and you have to have legs in there. Shelvey, I think I‚Äôd keep him in there. He does stupid things, that would worry me a little bit. When you are talking about the best in that position ‚Äì Declan Rice at West Ham and N‚ÄôGolo Kante at Chelsea, they are the best. I think Rice has gone beyond Kante now as the best in the Premier League, but there is no chance of getting him. It would be how Shelvey plays. Technically, passing-wise, he‚Äôs as good anybody, I just worry about his mobility and getting around. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd then try and get Jesse Lingard. He did brilliantly at West Ham and will be out of contract. He costs you ¬£10m, probably, for a ¬£40-50m player. You have to pay him good wages, but again I think the fans will love him. He‚Äôs got energy, gets up and down, scores goals and the only person that scores goals at the moment for us is Callum Wilson. If he gets injured, we are in serious trouble.‚Äù Is Wales international Ramsey worth a shout?  ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs fit, he‚Äôs as good as there is. I‚Äôd even chuck Gareth Bale in. I don‚Äôt think he got the praise he should have done at Tottenham. If you look at the number of games he started under [Jose] Mourinho and the goals he scored, he was as good as anything. On his day, he‚Äôs still unplayable. Those two, if you can get them both and keep them fit, then I would do it all day long. It would cost you big money in wages, but it won‚Äôt cost you so much to get them. Ramsey, I think you‚Äôd get him. Juve want him out. Bale, they have been trying to get rid of him for so long, so it‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs making sure they want to come to Newcastle, that they are up for the battle. It‚Äôs okay having all this money but you have to spend it wisely and get the right players.‚Äù What about Coutinho and Barkley, who both have Premier League experience?  ‚ÄúCoutinho I wouldn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt go near him. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs done great since he left Liverpool and he was in a very good Liverpool side. I think that money for him was a lot, in my opinion. Barkley? Again, if you can get him playing how he can do than maybe, but he doesn‚Äôt really play. He looks like one of those players where when you don‚Äôt play him he gets lethargic, puts on weight. You have to play him. He has to play for a manager and get his head down and work hard. The off-field stuff has to stop and he has to concentrate on his football. But on his day he is a top player.‚Äù Players linked: Gareth Bale (Real Madrid), Ousmane Dembele (Barcelona), Eden Hazard (Real Madrid), Ismaila Sarr (Watford) Selection: ""[Allan Saint-Maximin] is exciting. I like him. He‚Äôs not as good as [David] Ginola, but that sort of thing. He gets people excited, but he has to be consistent. Some weeks he carries the team on his own but he doesn‚Äôt score enough for me, he doesn‚Äôt create enough for what he is. He has to improve on that but I‚Äôd definitely keep him in.‚Äù Is Bale being favoured over Hazard?  ‚ÄúAll day long. Hazard I wouldn‚Äôt touch. He‚Äôs playing for the best team in Spain and I think he‚Äôs been dreadful for the money they paid for him. He plays for one of the best national teams on paper in Belgium, and he hasn‚Äôt been great for them either. He was fantastic at Chelsea but seems to be one of those players that has gone to Real Madrid, got a massive contract and looks like football isn‚Äôt a priority. I might be wrong. He looks like he isn‚Äôt bothered. I wouldn‚Äôt pay him big money to come to Newcastle.‚Äù What about Dembele, he‚Äôs a World Cup winner and running down his contract at Barcelona?  ‚ÄúI know a lot of World Cup winners that aren‚Äôt great! We signed Stephane Guivarc‚Äôh, World Cup winner, and he wasn‚Äôt great for us and went to Rangers and wasn‚Äôt great. I don‚Äôt take too much into consideration what they‚Äôve won and what they‚Äôve done. I just look at a player that can do well. It‚Äôs just knowing players that you can keep fit, know the Premier League and can hit the ground running. You have got no pre-season, you have to get players that can go ‚Äòbang‚Äô, by the time you arrive in January you will be playing in three or four days, and you have to play well.‚Äù Players linked: Divock Origi (Liverpool), Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal), Anthony Martial (Manchester United), Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton), Mauro Icardi (PSG), Timo Werner (Chelsea) Selection: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd take Calvert-Lewin. He‚Äôs been injured quite a while and Everton have suffered while he‚Äôs been injured. I would take him all day. Wilson is our main striker, so can you play him with someone else or is Eddie going to play one up front? If he is, then it has to be someone who is content to play when Wilson is not fit, or wide. It‚Äôs a difficult situation, like the Spurs one with [Harry] Kane ‚Äì they say they should get another striker, but if Kane is fit then he plays. ‚ÄúJoelinton has been playing 10, can play wide. Everyone says he has improved, and he has, but he had to. Being brutally honest, for ¬£40m he doesn‚Äôt score, he doesn‚Äôt create, he‚Äôs just working hard now, getting tackles in and is a big, strong lad. I think we need more than that.‚Äù Why is Howe the right man for the job?  ‚ÄúHe brought Bournemouth up from nowhere. He got them in the Premier League, which was virtually impossible. I think he is going to find it different being at Newcastle to being at Bournemouth or Burnley. This is a huge football club and the expectation is going to be huge. But he‚Äôs a good manager. Hopefully he will bring the right players in that he thinks will improve us. Only time will tell. There is huge pressure on him to do well with all this money and you hope he gets a say about who comes in.‚Äù Is he a good fit because he wants to play attractive football?  ‚ÄúBecause of how we played, the entertainers many years ago under Kevin Keegan, the fans expect that now, they expect exciting football. Even from Malcolm Macdonald through Gazza etc, they have always tried to play good football. They don‚Äôt mind you losing. It‚Äôs a myth that they are delusional about where they should be, they don‚Äôt mind losing. They want to see attractive football, good players pulling the shirt on and giving 100 per cent in every game. If they get that on a Saturday and they lose, they will be fine, it‚Äôs not an issue. If Newcastle went down, they would still get 52,000 people. What other team would do that? That‚Äôs what makes it such a fantastic club. If these players do well and once someone wins something at Newcastle they will be idolised forever and there will be statues all over the place!‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lingard-at-10-and-bale-over-hazard-newcastle-fantasy-xi-compiled-/blt477dc4bcf753e009,Chris Burton,2a9b38bd-3160-41c1-a83e-57d9004db00a
Liverpool for the quadruple? Kop celebration shows Klopp believes anything is possible for rampant Reds,"A special night called for a special celebration, and Jurgen Klopp wasn‚Äôt about to disappoint. We are well used to the Liverpool boss‚Äô antics in front of the Kop by now, but rarely have we seen him like this. A five-star performance and a six-goal victory drew no fewer than eight fist pumps from the manager, as well as a smile that could have lit up the whole of Merseyside.¬† ‚ÄúI got a little bit carried away,‚Äù Klopp admitted after watching his side make mincemeat of Leeds United at Anfield on Wednesday night, but we can forgive him for that, surely? This was the Reds‚Äô biggest home league win since September 2007, their ninth in a row in all competitions, and one which cuts the gap to Manchester City at the top of the Premier League to just three points. It‚Äôs hard not to get swept along by Liverpool at the moment, and it was hard not to see Klopp‚Äôs celebration here, and the response it drew from his supporters, as a sign that this is a manager, a team, a club and a fanbase that believes special things are coming their way.¬† Why wouldn‚Äôt they? Playing like this, who do they need to fear? Not City, with whom an April showdown at the Etihad looms large, and certainly not Chelsea, who await in Sunday‚Äôs Carabao Cup final at Wembley. Liverpool already have one foot in the last eight of the Champions League, and none of Europe‚Äôs elite sides will want to face them right now. They look like a team utterly at ease with itself, confident and cohesive, and capable of winning games by any means necessary. If you fancy a fight, they‚Äôll stand toe-to-toe. If you want to stand off then they‚Äôll find a way through. JURGEN KLOPP BELIEVES üò§ pic.twitter.com/QlN0LgJyoI And if you want to come out and have a go, then the chances are you‚Äôll get what Leeds got here.¬† Battered. Wherever you look there are shows of strength. Liverpool made seven changes against Norwich last weekend and six against Leeds, but you‚Äôd never have known. The intensity was the same, the quality was the same and so was the outcome. Whoever Klopp plugs in at the moment, and whoever he brings off the bench, they‚Äôre fit, firing and ready to deliver. Mohamed Salah, of course, is the team‚Äôs talisman, its leading scorer and its star name. The Egyptian took his season‚Äôs tally to 27 with a pair of penalties against Leeds, and added a sublime assist for good measure. The total of 44 goals he achieved in his debut season at Anfield, 2017-18, looks well within reach between now and May. How scary a thought is that? But this is far from a one-man show. Liverpool now have the Premier League‚Äôs top three goalscorers in Salah, Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane, and boast top three assist-makers too in Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson. Overall, they have scored 106 goals in all competitions, and they have now kept seven clean sheets in their last 10 matches, conceding only three times. What more could you wish for in a team? Whether it‚Äôs the main men or the support cast, everyone has the script nailed down. Klopp‚Äôs squad is as strong now as it has ever been, the strongest in the country perhaps, and that competition has driven the standard up to a new, remarkable level. And so we get to see special things on a weekly basis. Things like Joel Matip, striding through midfield like Steven Gerrard and finishing like Robbie Fowler. That‚Äôs been coming, that goal. Liverpool 6-0 Leeds.The gap to Manchester City closes to three points üëÄ pic.twitter.com/68YOxIwrfW We get to see Thiago Alcantara, as fit and as sharp as he‚Äôs been since his arrival on Merseyside, demonstrating exactly why Reds fans couldn‚Äôt believe their luck when they were able to prise him from Bayern Munich. What a sight the Spaniard is in this kind of form.¬† What a sight Salah is, a supreme goalscorer and an elite creator, yet one still willing to harry and to press and to chase back for the good of the team. The same goes for Mane, a difference-maker in every sense, while new signing Luis Diaz looks like he‚Äôs been here for years rather than weeks. Another feather in the cap for the club‚Äôs recruitment team, that one. No wonder Klopp was smiling as he headed down the tunnel on Wednesday night. He can do no wrong at the minute, and nor can his players.¬† The key now is to ensure they have something real to show for it come May. Something silver and shiny. However, on recent evidence, the question is not whether Liverpool will win a trophy this season, rather how many. One, two, three or four? Klopp‚Äôs eight fist pumps on Wednesday suggest he‚Äôs thinking about them all.¬†Starting at Wembley on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-klopp-kop-celebration-quadruple-possible/bltd12991f7b17be531,Neil Jones,0f23b1b2-a14b-47b6-80d0-8b87d36aa0f2
Liverpool's new hero! How Nunez outshone Haaland and gave Klopp exactly what he wanted,"One game, one goal, one trophy. One new hero, topless and top-knotted, for Liverpool supporters to worship. As debuts go, Darwin Nunez could hardly have asked for a better one. When you arrive at a new club in a new league, and for a big transfer fee, the first thing you want to do is start well.

Fabinho reveals how he met Mourinho in his pyjamas to discuss Real Madrid transfer,"Liverpool star Fabinho opened up on how he was caught off guard in his pyjamas during his first meeting with Jose Mourinho before signing for Real Madrid. The Brazilian midfielder had a short stint with Madrid on loan from Rio Ave in 2013, making just one appearance for the senior team and 30 more for Real Madrid Castilla. Now a Champions League and Premier League winner with Liverpool, Fabinho can look back and laugh at how his big move to Real Madrid was preceded by a meeting with Mourinho in some less-than-formal attire. ‚ÄúWe arrived in Portugal, but I stayed around at Rio Ave for just two weeks, maybe three at the most,‚Äù Fabinho told FourFourTwo. ‚ÄúI had a barbecue with other Brazilians and then my agent called to say that Real Madrid Castilla [Real Madrid reserve team] needed a right-back and wanted to know if I was interested. ‚ÄúThen one night, Lucio [Araujo, brother of former Chelsea and Barcelona midfielder Deco], came and told me to pack my things because Jorge Mendes was on his way by car in the early hours of the morning. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòIs something wrong?‚Äô Nobody said a word, but then at some point in the car, Mendes said we were travelling to Madrid and that I would sign for them.  ‚ÄúI called my mum in Brazil to tell her about that and she started to cry. ‚ÄúNo-one had expected something this huge to happen in such a short time. It was a very special moment for me.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúWe headed to the hotel in Madrid, and while I was still sleeping, I woke up to somebody knocking on the door.  ‚ÄúI looked through the peephole and couldn't believe it. It was Mendes and Jose Mourinho! ‚ÄúI was still wearing my pyjamas, not at all prepared to meet him. I didn't even know what to say. ‚ÄúHe wanted to welcome me. I was still a bit shy and never thought I would meet him like that!"" Fabinho returned to Rio Ave in 2013 after being unable to seal a first-team spot in Madrid and was then loaned out to Monaco.  He featured for the club for two years before the move was made permanent in 2015, then earned a move to Liverpool three years later. The Brazilian's gone on to be a regular under Jurgen Klopp, making 155 total appearances for the club so far.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fabinho-reveals-how-he-met-mourinho-in-his-pyjamas-to/blt1a374b244549d630,Ryan Tolmich,e15f3276-f85a-4384-a5eb-47ebfda8c4c3

AC Milan‚Äôs Bennacer fires Cameroon warning with winner against Balde‚Äôs Cagliari,"Ismael Bennacer has sent Cameroon a strong warning ahead of next week‚Äôs 2022 Fifa World Cup qualification play-off with a goal as AC Milan secured a 1-0 win at Cagliari on Saturday. The Algeria international‚Äôs effort proved to be the winner as the Red and Blacks brightened their chances of emerging as Serie A champions. Following back-to-back victories against Napoli and Empoli, AC Milan travelled to Sardegna Arena to face their relegation-threatened hosts.¬† They put up an impressive showing from the very blast of referee Marco Di Bello‚Äôs whistle, but the Islanders‚Äô defence thwarted their waves of attacks. As the game progressed, Cagliari grew in confidence to match Stefano Pioli‚Äôs side in terms of ball possession. Even at that, the teams went into the half-time break a no winner, no vanquished note. However, AC Milan took the lead a minute before the hour mark courtesy of Bennacer. After collecting a pass from Olivier Giroud, the 24-year-old drilled the ball past goalkeeper Alessio Cragno in emphatic fashion, sending the travelling support into raptures. Not willing to go down without a fight, the hosts attacked in numbers but were unable to get the leveller, although they missed several scoring opportunities. In the closing stages, Giroud was denied a second goal in three games by a sprawling Cragno save.¬† At the end of 90 minutes, AC Milan returned home with maximum points with Cagliari extending their losing streak to three.¬† Bennacer - who has now scored his second goal of the 2021-22 campaign - was on parade from start to finish alongside Cote d‚ÄôIvoire Franck Kessie and DR Congo prospect Pierre Kalulu.¬† Whereas, Africa Cup of Nations-winning defender Fode Ballo-Toure was an unused substitute.¬† For Cagliari, Keita Balde was introduced for Alberto Grassi with eight minutes left on the clock.¬† Bennacer is expected to join the rest of the Algeria squad on Monday to commence preparations for their play-off against Rigobert Song‚Äôs Cameroon.

‚ÄòMessi left Barcelona crying‚Äô ‚Äì Henry calls for patience with PSG form after 'emotional shock',"Thierry Henry has called for patience with Lionel Messi as he scratches around for top form at Paris Saint-Germain, with a former team-mate of the legendary Argentine pointing out that he ‚Äúleft Barcelona crying‚Äù and suffered an ‚Äúemotional shock‚Äù before embarking on a new adventure. The seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner stunned the football world during the summer of 2021 when it was announced that he would be leaving Camp Nou as a free agent and taking his considerable talents to Parc des Princes. The iconic 34-year-old has found the going tough in French football, on the back of a record-setting spell in Spain, but Henry ‚Äì who spent three years alongside Messi in Catalunya between 2007 and 2010 ‚Äì can appreciate why a spark is still being sought by an all-time great. Discussing mental health with L‚ÄôEquipe, Arsenal icon Henry said when asked if Messi‚Äôs supposed struggles ‚Äì with only seven goals registered this season ‚Äì could be linked to his well-being: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to ask him, I can‚Äôt speak for him. But, when we tal about Messi or Neymar, who are exceptional players, we too often forget that aspect. ‚ÄúWhen Lionel cried on leaving Barcelona, that wasn‚Äôt part of the plan. When you think you‚Äôre never going to leave somewhere, and then suddenly it happens, it creates an emotional shock. ‚ÄúPeople say, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs fine, he‚Äôs got everything he needs in Paris‚Äô, but it‚Äôs not that simple. ‚ÄúWhen I left Arsenal for Barcelona it took me a year to feel good. I arrived there with an injury, going through a divorce, I have to learn a new system, you mix all of that up and it plays on the mind.‚Äù Messi has not spoken in public about enduring problems in Paris, but Henry believes competitors in any sport should be able to air their issues if something does start to hold them back and impact on professional duties as well as personal lives. The 1998 World Cup winner added: ‚ÄúWhen someone opens up today on a sensitive subject, we can no longer turn away and reject what they‚Äôre saying. ‚ÄúEveryone likes it when you say you‚Äôre good. Why would it be wrong to say that you‚Äôre not feeling well in your head? It won‚Äôt stop you from being judged on your game. ‚ÄúWhen [tennis player Naomi] Osaka spoke out, it didn‚Äôt shock me. My reaction was, ‚Äòah, I understand‚Äô. Previously, for me, being able to share your faults was a weakness. ‚ÄúToday, I think it's a strength to be vulnerable. When you free yourself of something which has been a burden for a long time, you feel light, you run quicker, you sleep better, you eat better.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-left-barcelona-crying-henry-patience-psg-form/blt1c7a16e8c96b6bfd,Chris Burton,817ff84b-4392-4f56-b268-d96a38e168e7
"Afcon 2021: Senegal vs Cape Verde Preview - Kick-off time, TV channel, squad news","Senegal will continue their quest to clinch their first-ever Africa Cup of Nations title when they take on Cape Verde in their Round of 16 fixture at Stade Omnisports de Bafoussam on Tuesday. Despite taking part in the previous 15 editions of Afcon, the Lions of Teranga are yet to win the title and in the last edition held in 2019 in Egypt, they came close, reaching the final but lost 1-0 to Algeria. They also reached the final of the 2002 edition but lost to Cameroon 3-2 on penalties after a 0-0 draw. In Cameroon, Senegal, led by coach Aliou Cisse, have not been convincing enough as they struggled to reach the knockout stage. The Lions of Teranga kicked off their Group B campaign with a 1-0 win against Zimbabwe, with Sadio Mane notching the lone goal from the penalty spot in stoppage time, recorded a 0-0 draw against Guinea, and then registered another 0-0 result against Malawi. On the other hand, Cape Verde reached the knockout stage for the second time in their third appearance as one of the highest-ranked third-placed teams, after finishing third in Group A with four points. The Blue Sharks kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 win against Ethiopia, suffered a 1-0 defeat against Burkina Faso before forcing a vital 1-1 draw against hosts Cameroon.   Senegal have not reported any injuries or Covid-19 related issues ahead of the fixture. However, winger Ismaila Sarr, who was allowed to travel to Spain to check on a knee specialist, is yet to return to Cameroon and will thus not be available to face the Blue Sharks. Goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and defender Kalidou Koulibaly are also available after missing the two group phase matches against the Warriors and the Syli Nationale owing to Covid-19. Meanwhile, Cape Verde suffered a huge blow ahead of the fixture after they confirmed on Monday an outbreak of gastroenteritis in their camp. The West African nation disclosed eight people in their team were affected by intestinal inflammation which was caused by food poisoning but they could not divulge the names of the players or the officials affected. Despite the situation, coach Pedro Brito is confident they have what it takes to stun the Lions of Teranga. ‚ÄúWe have worked hard in our training and facing a team like Senegal is an added motivation, because the match is like a derby,‚Äù Brito said. ‚ÄúThey have to respect us as a team the same way we respect them. The competition has seen a lot of surprises, and we hope to be the other team that will cause an upset as our mission is to win the game and move to the next round.‚Äù In the history of Afcon, this will be the first meeting between Senegal and Cape Verde. Senegal have won three of their last four games in the knockout stage of the competition, with their only defeat in this run coming in the 2019 final against Algeria. Cape Verde have only played one game in the knockout stage of the tournament previously, losing 0-2 to Ghana in the 2013 quarter-final. They have only one won of their six games in the competition between that defeat and the end of this season‚Äôs group stage (W1 D4 L1). Senegal are the only team to have kept a clean sheet in 100% of their games at this year‚Äôs competition (3/3). Indeed, they have allowed the fewest opposition shots on target (three) and also have the lowest expected goals against a total (1.6) in the current tournament. Cape Verde have only scored six goals in their 10 games in Afcon, at an average of 0.6 per game. A third of their goals in the tournament were scored in a 2-1 win against Angola in 2013, while they have only netted three in seven games since then. While Senegal, are making their 16th appearance at the Afcon, a record for a team that has never won the trophy, this is Cape Verde‚Äôs third appearance, with all the three taking place since 2013.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-senegal-vs-cape-verde-preview-kick-off-time-tv/blt9d42fdd670a7b3b2,Dennis Mabuka,c419c568-cb2a-4708-9cd3-9b48841dcbe8
"Inside Arsenal's Dubai training camp: Who is going, what's happening and what about transfers?","It is a mid-season break that could not have come at a better time for Arsenal. The Gunners‚Äô squad has been decimated in recent weeks through a mixture of injuries, Covid-19 and players being away on international duty. Performances have suffered as a result, with Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side going winless throughout January. They played five games during the opening month of 2022 in all competitions, losing three and drawing two - going out of both domestic cup competitions in the process. It has been a miserable few weeks which have also seen them lose ground in the race for a top-four finish, so a training camp in Dubai could be just what the doctor ordered for Arsenal. ‚ÄúThe players are really tired, ‚Äú Mikel Arteta admitted after Sunday‚Äôs disappointing 0-0 draw with bottom-of-the-table Burnley. ‚ÄúWe had a really demanding and challenging situation in the last four weeks because some players have been sick, injured, and we‚Äôve trying to bring them back, trying to expose them onto pitches when they‚Äôve not been ready. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have a training camp all together in a different environment. We‚Äôre going to reunite, refocus and have a good go, because there's still a lot to play for.‚Äù Arsenal‚Äôs first-team squad have been given some time off since the Burnley game on Sunday, with the training camp not due to get under way until they fly out on Thursday morning. Several players, along with their wives and partners, have already travelled over to the United Arab Emirates, however, and are enjoying some down time before the rest of the squad and coaching staff arrive later in the week, with the first training session scheduled for late on Thursday afternoon. One player who is not expected to travel, however, is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The former captain, who has not played since December 6, is the subject of growing transfer interest and looks set to remain to England where he will continue to train alone while talks continue over his future. Arsenal will remain in Dubai until Wednesday, February 2, as Arteta looks to get his squad in the best possible shape ahead of the second half of the season, which gets underway against Wolves on February 10. But the trip is not just about training, Arteta wants to use the time away as an opportunity to bring the squad together. There will be team bonding sessions held throughout Arsenal‚Äôs stay, as well as the odd sponsorship event - with Dubai the home of Arsenal‚Äôs primary sponsors, Emirates. The Gunners are not due to play a friendly while they are away, with the current plan to organise a behind-closed-doors training ground game once they return next week. While Arteta will be with the squad, technical director Edu and director of football operations Richard Garlick will remain in England at the club‚Äôs London Colney training base. They are staying behind to work on any transfer deals that could take place before next Monday‚Äôs transfer deadline, with Arsenal still in the market for a goalkeeper, a midfielder and a striker. Whether any new signings arrive remains to be seen, but Edu and other senior figures at the club want to remain on home soil to ensure they can get something done if an opportunity arises, with a move for United States goalkeeper Matt Turner believed to be progressing well. ‚ÄúIt's what we planned, but the market is difficult, it's complicated,‚Äù Arteta said on Sunday, when asked if he expected to have some new signings on board by now. ‚ÄúWe are certainly trying, but I don't know if we're going to be able to do it [before deadline day]. ‚ÄúPlayers that come here have to be able to take us to the next level. We already have a level, and we want to see much better standards than we already have, and that is how we're going to recruit.‚Äù With Arsenal out in Dubai until Wednesday, the plan is for any new recruit to fly out and join the squad on the trip, should they arrive in time. Arteta is currently in America, where he has been holding talks with Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke. Arteta clocking up the air miles.A quick stop in the US to meet with the Kroenkes before heading to Dubai later this week. https://t.co/0zHLiZXP0j The pair were spotted together in Denver on Monday evening watching Kroenke‚Äôs Colorado Avalanche win their 16th straight home game in the NHL. Due to the pandemic, Arteta has been unable to spend much face-to-face time with Arsenal‚Äôs owner in the past two years, so he wanted to take this opportunity to fly out and meet with him. The Spaniard‚Äôs trip to the States comes amid growing suggestions of a possible contract extension. It is not believed, however, that this visit was centred around any specific topic. Arteta is expected to fly straight to Dubai from America, but neither Stan Kroenke - or his son Josh - are believed to be joining him. With Arsenal‚Äôs manager keen to use the time away to bring his squad closer together, even players who are currently struggling with injuries - such as Takehiro Tomiyasu - are expected to travel to the training camp. A number of youngsters - including rising star Charlie Patino - are also set to travel, with a group of around 30 players set to make up the numbers.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/inside-arsenal-dubai-training-camp-transfers/bltc304ae387fc56cbc,Charles Watts,05d137e5-0753-4d62-9a1a-d2016ea862b7
USMNT star Adams: I'm more like Kante than Busquets,"United States men's national team and RB Leipzig midfielder Tyler Adams has opened up on his style of play, comparing himself to N'Golo Kante in terms of how he tries to operate on the field. Adams has emerged as a star for club and country, and he figures to be a key player in the Stars and Stripes' pursuit of a World Cup place. The 23-year-old is known for his pressing ability and ball-winning prowess. ""Growing up, when N‚ÄôGolo Kante hit the scene, he was the player who changed the mould of how a No.6 should play the game,"" Adams told The Athletic. ""It was no longer only the style of Sergio Busquets. Everyone wanted to be like him ‚Äî and why wouldn‚Äôt they? ‚Äî but I‚Äôm more like Kante than I am Busquets. So I was happy because players like this were finally getting the praise they deserve for doing the hard work and being the engine of the team. ""Not everything that Kante does is beautiful but you look at the end of the game and see how many duels and tackles he‚Äôs won and how many transition moments he stopped - that‚Äôs a huge benefit to teams, especially when you play an attacking style of football. ""Fabinho at Liverpool is another one. He does a little bit of everything. I like how well-rounded his game is and I want my game to be as well-rounded as possible."" Adams, who spent the early days of his career in MLS, has made 24 appearances in all competitions for RB Leipzig this season while being a regular in the USMNT lineup. With the USMNT in second place in CONCACAF, it's likely he will be able to feature in the World Cup in Qatar alongside midfielder Weston McKennie, who also plays in Europe for Juventus. His style of play will help manager Gregg Berhalter imitate some of the things Adams does well at RB Leipzig. ""If you look at our national team and the way it‚Äôs built, we have so many guys who are good at pressing,"" he said. ""They have the engines, they have the physicality, they have the desire to get after the ball because we know that one of our strengths is winning the ball when our opponent is open and getting the ball to players like Gio Reyna and Christian Pulisic. ""Playing with guys like Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Kellyn Acosta, those guys are built for this kind of thing. We get after guys, we tackle, we foul guys, and that creates a midfield people don‚Äôt want to play against. So we all have the instinct to win the ball and press.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-adams-more-like-kante-than-busquets/blt7fb2300f29d45993,Dan Bernstein,097370b0-9cdd-4af3-a561-71c0ddcedc4e
Messi in decline? Why PSG's 'bling bling' squad building as much to blame,"Who would have thought when Lionel Messi signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August that six months later he would be sitting on just one domestic goal for the season? Sure, it has been a campaign disrupted by minor injuries, illness and an unusual intensity of international games, but certainly not to the degree that it should have thrown the seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner off his stride to such a remarkable degree. The little Argentine is on course for his worst full campaign ever, having netted only against Nantes. Since finding the target that November day, he has chalked up a number of assists, but he has also gone seven appearances without scoring in French football, including Monday's Coupe de France elimination against Nice. Messi‚Äôs meagre statistics primarily show three things. Firstly, that the French domestic game is not as weak as it is popularly portrayed; secondly that, yes, he has struggled to adapt to a new club, culture and city; and thirdly, that PSG are a team that has been inadequately built. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino has been targeted up to now due to PSG‚Äôs disappointing performances this season, but while the Argentine has his share of the blame to take, sporting director Leonardo is the common denominator for the club‚Äôs underperformance in Europe since returning to the club in 2019. PSG, after all, are a team that has been patched together out of convenience as much as anything else. Former player Thomas Meunier, who spent four years at the club between 2016-2020, put it nicely when he told L‚ÄôEquipe on Saturday: ‚ÄúThe PSG project has been about the bling bling since its creation, and it has to stay that way. It must make you dream more than anything else.‚Äù Personalities, then, are as important as footballing ability in Leonardo‚Äôs PSG, and thhis has been illustrated this year better than ever. Sergio Ramos arrived having played only 21 games for Real Madrid last season due to injury and has managed only five appearances in Paris. He is unlikely to be fit to face his former club in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash. The thinking behind signing Georginio Wijnaldum, meanwhile, seemed to be to deny Barcelona the opportunity of capturing him. It is not a problem that Neymar has spent much of the past two years underperforming, because he is one of the most marketable stars in the game. Short-term thinking has left the squad bloated by mediocre players on big wages, as was highlighted during the January transfer window, when PSG tried unsuccessfully to move on any number of fringe players who are on expensive deals. ‚ÄúPSG have an overstaffed squad,‚Äù Jerome Rothen, a former PSG and France star, pointed out on RMC. ‚ÄúIf they signed one or two players in January, it would have become unworkable for Mauricio Pochettino. ‚ÄúPSG have players, but PSG can‚Äôt sell. They have to find a way out. Players don‚Äôt want to leave. ‚ÄúLeonardo is PSG‚Äôs central problem. To get players to leave, you need to have a network across all clubs and you need to have a relationship with the players who aren‚Äôt playing.‚Äù The Brazilian also stands accused of allowing a culture of leaving too much power in the hands of the players. ‚ÄúThis is the unacceptable part of the club,‚Äù Rothen bemoaned in January, referring to Neymar‚Äôs penchant for the Parisian nightlife. ""I‚Äôm once again angry with the sporting director because he is in charge of this. His hands are not tied. We have to stop thinking that the board or the president or the coach prevent him from doing this or that. No, he decides everything!‚Äù It is amidst this disorganised backdrop that Messi has found himself at PSG. He has gone from Barcelona, a club that has for so long prided itself on its style, philosophy and identity, to one where commercial and sponsorship opportunities appear to be king. A group of disparate stars have been brought together into the hope that individual excellence can somehow trump a more cohesive and cerebral plan. Unsurprisingly, it does not appear to be working ‚Äì for Messi as much as anyone else.  Worse still, it now appears certain that they will lose their best player, Kylian Mbappe, on a free transfer this summer.  Should Messi fail to score in Sunday‚Äôs trip to defending champions Lille, he will have completed his first six months at PSG with just a single domestic goal to his name, and it is little wonder there are already reports that he is discontent at this quite unique club.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-decline-psg-bling-bling-squad-blame/blt70ceaf72f32f1460,Robin Bairner,e32925ce-b5cb-42fd-9b9e-e9ce1cbc46c6
'Barcelona have returned!' - Laporta warns rivals that club is back on top after Torres addition,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta has declared his club is back at the top level despite sitting in fifth place in La Liga after their marquee signing of Ferran Torres. The Catalan side have endured a rough period on and off the pitch as financial problems resulted in the departure of star player Lionel Messi in August and some subpar results in the first half of the season. In addition to their disappointing league position, Barca were knocked out of the Champions League at the group stage, but Laporta feels the ‚Ç¨55 million (¬£46m/$62m) arrival of Torres from Manchester City is evidence they are back to their best. ""We continue to be an example in the football market,‚Äù Laporta said at a press conference on Monday. ‚ÄúEveryone should be ready because we have returned. We are an example, and the example is that Ferran is here. We are re-emerging. ""We work calmly. We are on the way to make additions in winter, and we are also working in the medium term.‚Äù Coach Xavi admitted last week that they cannot afford to register Torres as a Barcelona player just yet, as they need to offload some players to make room for him. Meanwhile, full-back Dani Alves is yet to be registered after agreeing to join the club in November. But Laporta is confident that the Brazilian full-back will soon be cleared to play, with Torres expected to be ready shortly afterwards. ‚ÄúToday or tomorrow, we will register Alves and we hope to register Ferran as soon as possible,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe is a spectacular signing. Ferran Torres has shown a lot of desire to come to Bar√ßa and I want to thank him.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-have-returned-laporta-warns-rivals-that-club-is/blt9eae35747448a3b1,By Peter McVitie,211c2785-daa3-4320-ab80-371c137a235d

Aurier 'very sad' for Pochettino amid PSG struggles,"Serge Aurier feels ""very sad"" for the way Mauricio Pochettino has struggled to win over Paris Saint-Germain, with the Villarreal captain stating the Argentine should not shoulder all the blame for their frustrations. Pochettino succeeded Thomas Tuchel midway through the 2020-21 campaign, but has struggled to deliver the results anticipated since taking the reins. He is on course to lead the club to another Ligue 1 title this season, but his squad of superstars has often looked more like individuals than a team, and their Champions League exit to Real Madrid has compounded frustration - but Aurier feels that Pochettino is up against ""internal problems"" he cannot control. ""I'm very sad,"" Aurier told beIN Sports. ""He's someone I learned a lot from. I know the person. I'm disappointed with the way things are going. ""I was really happy when he was approached by Paris. From what I learned and what I saw, I knew he had the soul to give this team what was missing. ""Unfortunately, it hasn't always gone well since he's there. I think it's not just his fault. The Ivory Coast international previously played for PSG before he went on to play under Pochettino at Tottenham, where the duo reached the 2019 UEFA Champions League final, and the 29-year-old believes that the difference in squad harmony has been a stumbling block for the Argentine at Parc des Princes.

 When does Afcon 2021 start & finish? Key dates & fixtures for tournament,"The Africa Cup of Nations is set to begin in January of 2022 after having skipped a year due to Covid-19 disruptions, and Premier League stars such as Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez will all be making an appearance in the tournament. It is Africa's showpiece competition, consisting of 24 teams battling it out to be crowned the ultimate continental champions. So when does Afcon 2021 begin and end? GOAL takes a look. Afcon 2021 is scheduled to begin on January 9, 2022 and end on February 6, 2022. The competition was originally set to be played in June and July 2021, but the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) stated that due to the hot climate during the summer months, the tournament would be played in January and February 6. However, due to the impacts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the tournament was once again moved and delayed for one year. Furthermore, the tournament will be retaining its name of Afcon 2021 instead of Afcon 2022 due to sponsorship reasons, much like the way the European Championships kept the Euro 2020 name even though it was played a year later in 2021. Afcon 2021 will take place in Cameroon. The opening and closing matches are set to be played at the new Olembe Stadium in Yaounde, which seats 60,000.  The games will be played across at least six venues across five cities in Cameroon, including Olembe Stadium and Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde, the¬†Japoma Stadium¬†in¬†Douala, the¬†Limbe Stadium¬†in¬†Limbe, the¬†Kouekong Stadium¬†in¬†Bafoussam¬†and the¬†Roumde Adjia Stadium¬†in¬†Garoua. Algerica are defending champions, having won Afcon in 2019 after beating Senegal 1-0 in the final. Baghdad Bounedjah scored in the second minute to give Algeria the early and competition-defining lead. Afcon 2021 will be broadcast on beIN Sports in the United States (US), while it will be available to watch on BBC in the United Kingdom (U.K.)",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-does-afcon-2021-start-and-finish-key-dates-and-fixtures-for-/blt2e05bc9bf4226df6,GOAL,04b3ea91-7b68-4128-88f7-44727eb22bb9

'Rangnick wants us to cut that out' - McTominay reveals body language talk as Man Utd beat Burnley,"Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has acknowledged that manager Ralf Rangnick told players to cut out bad body language on the pitch during games. The Red Devils bounced back from a 1-1 draw against Newcastle with a 3-1 win over Burnley on Thursday. In that frustrating affair against the Magpies, Manchester United were blasted for complaining to one another on the pitch, with Gary Neville going so far as to call them a ""bunch of whingebags"". ""Body language is one thing and the manager has come in and said he wants to cut that [poor body language] out, so that is final,"" McTominay told Amazon. ""We have taken it on board. ""The game against Newcastle was difficult and we have to bounce back from that. The manager said we set the record for the most amount of turnovers in the league. We had to keep the ball better. ""Now is the time we really start stepping up and doing much, much better. The manager is so demanding and we play for Man Utd, it is what we have to do."" ""As expected it was a very tough, physical game against a team who play very physical,"" the manager told reporters. ""We also showed the qualities we have in our team. It was important to raise the energy level. ""The whole team performance was a lot better, I was pleased with the performances of our wingers. Jadon Sancho did well and Mason Greenwood. Eddie [Cavani] and Cristiano Ronaldo, the effort was amazing."" Unlike against Newcastle, when they played from behind most of the way, Manchester United struck early against Burnley with McTominay netting in the eighth minute. By the 35th minute, they held a 3-0 advantage. Their body language appeared more positive, too, although being ahead likely helped their mood. Manchester United have taken 14 points from their last six games - 10 more than they managed in their final six under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rangnick-wants-us-to-cut-that-out-mctominay-reveals-body/blt43be2040dbf72e26,Dan Bernstein,fcd7cafb-a23b-4690-aad6-f5d77f662c83
Messi penalty miss: Madrid goalkeeper Courtois reveals how he knew PSG star would go to his left as he explains heroic save,"Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has explained his heroic penalty save from Lionel Messi, revealing that he knew the Paris Saint-Germain talisman would choose to go to his left. Madrid suffered a 1-0 loss at Parc des Princes in the first leg of their Champions League round-of-16 tie on Tuesday night, with Kylian Mbappe scoring a stunning late winner for PSG. The scoreline might have been far more one-sided were it not for Courtois, who made nine crucial saves, including one from a Messi spot-kick. The Madrid shot-stopper says he researched the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner's penalty technique before the contest just in case he was called upon to keep him out from 12 yards. Courtois told RMC Sport: ""I had studied him. He had missed once with Barcelona (against Courtois specifically, back in 2013) but it hit the bar and he had missed one with Paris going to the right side. ""I said to myself that he had more confidence on the left side. He had put it there against Bruges, also against Nice in the Coupe de France so I told myself that I had to dive to the left."" Messi's penalty miss against Madrid was his fifth in 23 attempts in the Champions League, while his other failures from the spot came during his 21-year stay at Barcelona. Only Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has missed as many spot-kicks in the competition's history, and the Argentine has also surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo's record for the most overall attempts. Courtois won't be taking anything for granted when he comes up against Messi in the second leg at Santiago Bernabeu, though, as he knows that the 34-year-old has the talent to conjure up a piece of magic at any moment. ""He‚Äôs not scored a lot of goals against me but, up against these great players, Leo, Neymar and [Angel] Di Maria, you‚Äôve always got to be careful,"" he added.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-penalty-miss-madrid-goalkeeper-courtois-psg-explains/blt66e4ec12b56de698,James Westwood,afe9a7b7-31f3-418e-b995-ef71f4c22428
Bertrand Traore‚Äôs Burkina Faso: Walking in the shadows of Afcon legends,"Bertrand Traore is one of the last remaining threads to the memorable Burkina Faso nation that took the country to new heights in African football. As the Aston Villa man prepares for the Stallions‚Äô Third-Placed Playoff at the current Africa Cup of Nations, the legacy of those ‚Äòbig brothers‚Äô who helped paint a new chapter in the national side‚Äôs history‚Äîand facilitate his transition to the international arena‚Äîcontinues to fuel the West Africans‚Äô footballing future. Traore, a one-time wonderkid at Chelsea, made his international debut way back in 2011‚Äîat the tender age of 15‚Äîand while he hasn‚Äôt quite reached the heights once expected of him, he‚Äôs been the Stallions‚Äô talisman at the Nations Cup and continues to be their most prominent player. Despite a tricky tournament that began with ‚Äòscandal‚Äô according to Traore, as he complained about the team‚Äôs coronavirus tests ahead of their opener against hosts Cameroon, and came to a halt with a semi-final defeat by Senegal, the wideman has impressed intermittently. There was the assist against the Indomitable Lions, their opponents on Saturday, to open the scoring in the tournament‚Äîa fine cross for Gustavo Sangare that evaded Andre Onana‚Äîand the opening goal against Gabon as the Stallions ousted the Panthers in the Round of 16. Their aim during the tournament was to surpass the country‚Äôs finest side‚Äîthe unlikely defeated finalists at the 2013 edition‚Äîand win the nation‚Äôs maiden Nations Cup crown. While this Burkina Faso team didn‚Äôt have legends of the ilk of Aristide Bance, Jonathan Pitroipa, Alain Traore or Charles Kabore, they have youth on their side, and deserve immense credit for battling through to the final amidst the ongoing Coup d‚ÄôEtat and political situation back in their homeland. President Roch Kabore was overthrown on January 23‚Äîonly hours ahead of Burkina Faso‚Äôs Last 16 game against Gabon‚Äîand while they‚Äôve missed out on the final, they have performed admirably in difficult circumstances‚Ä¶notably eliminating Tunisia at the quarter-final stage. Ultimately, they‚Äôve fallen just short, but as Traore looks ahead to the country‚Äôs sporting future, and assesses how they‚Äôve performed on the fields of Cameroon, he couldn‚Äôt help but pay tribute to those stars who paved his way to the national side. ‚ÄúIt was an honour for me to begin with national team so young,‚Äù he told GOAL, ‚Äúand to play with all the legends of our football.  ‚ÄúI learned a lot next to them, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to bring into the team, to the young generation  ‚ÄúAbove all else, it‚Äôs the humility these great players had‚Äîright from the first day, they welcomed me so well, and from the younger players to the older ones, they chatted with me like I‚Äôd been there for ten years.‚Äù  There‚Äôs inevitably a certain humility about Burkina Faso, whose unlikely run to the showpiece in 2013 came between a semi-final showing on home soil in 1998 and another final-four elimination in 2017.  Beyond that, their Nations Cup fortunes have been unspectacular‚Äîthey have been eliminated in the group stage without winning a single match in their other eight Afcon appearances‚Äîwhile they‚Äôve never reached the World Cup, nor produced a player to make the podium in the African Footballer of the Year awards. Yet the unlikely darlings of 2013 have earned cult-hero status both for their unity and fearlessness on the pitch, as well as their characters and nomadic careers off it. They may be unfashionable, but Traore believes that a lack of ego‚Äîpassed down through the generations‚Äîcan represent the nation‚Äôs great strength as they look to end the campaign on a high note. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the strength of our team,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt over-think things, there‚Äôs no big star, and we‚Äôre all on the same level. ‚ÄúWe talk together, walk together, and these are the lessons that the big brothers have left us. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to make it work.‚Äù Of course, neither Burkina Faso and Cameroon will be content to be contesting the third-placed match rather than the final this weekend, but with both teams having one eye on the future‚Äîand the Lions on the World Cup playoff against Algeria‚Äîthey‚Äôll recognise the value of ending the tournament on a high. For Burkina Faso, there‚Äôs an eye on the past too, as a young team who have done their nation proud this competition, continue to work in the footsteps of the great names gone by.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bertrand-traore-s-burkina-faso-walking-in-the-shadows-of/blt282d4dda28c666a4,Ed Dove,ae7b2801-1611-4a05-bb58-b4e5f5862ae9
Europa Conference League: Will Leicester City manager Rodgers lean on Iheanacho in Rome?,"It was interesting to listen to Brendan Rodgers and Kelechi Iheanacho‚Äôs post-match reactions after Leicester City‚Äôs 3-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. The Northern Irishman‚Äôs assessment of the frontman‚Äôs performance was not analogous to the Super Eagle‚Äôs evaluation, but both statements, by and large, summed up the former Manchester City striker. He scored a brilliantly taken goal but was guilty of losing possession at times. He scored a low-percentage effort but his decision-making and execution in other situations could be questioned. Evaluating someone who is often a mixed bag throughout 90 minutes can be a fool‚Äôs errand, yet Rodgers‚Äô remarks after the defeat were somewhat fitting. ‚ÄúIt was a very good strike and a very good goal,‚Äù Rodgers told the club‚Äôs official website after the game. ‚ÄúHe caused them a problem. He lost one or two balls which he can be better with, but overall, he kept fighting and running. It was a very, very good goal.‚Äù  Receiving the ball from Youri Tielemans in his favoured position in the right half-space, the Super Eagle, Iheanacho chopped infield, shifting the ball into a shooting position having deceived Harry Winks before sending a low drive beyond Hugo Lloris. ‚ÄúI had a shot in the first half and, in the second half, I took the ball quite well, I shifted it and saw the space and put it there,‚Äù the forward concisely put post-game. Indeed, that strike was reminiscent of a few goals in a prolific 2020/21 in which the Nigerian ended the campaign as Leicester‚Äôs top marksman, ending Jamie Vardy‚Äôs streak in that regard. Those moments of brilliance have been few and far between this term, with ‚ÄòSeniorman‚Äô netting only four Premier League goals this season, significantly fewer than the 12 he managed in the preceding campaign. The obvious vindicating factor for Iheanacho, apart from not being Rodgers‚Äô go-to man, has been the reversion to a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, moving away from a two-man frontline in which Iheanacho thrived in the second half of the previous campaign. Having said that, was Sunday‚Äôs selection and formation giving strong hints to the Leicester boss‚Äô thinking for Thursday‚Äôs decisive Europa Conference League encounter with Roma? While the Foxes‚Äô trainer may have had the reverse fixture with Jose Mourinho‚Äôs side in mind with his heavily rotated XI ‚Äî with slight injuries to James Maddison and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall causing the pair‚Äôs absence ‚Äî Rodgers‚Äô reversion to a back three with two up top favoured the frontman. Admittedly, the rationale behind that alteration could have been to match Antonio Conte‚Äôs men and it remains to be seen if the Leicester trainer retains the formation to duplicate Jose Mourinho‚Äôs approach or utilise a number nine with two wide attackers either side at the Stadio Olimpico. Either way, a case can be made for Iheanacho to start in Rome. Vardy remains the club‚Äôs talisman but the logic in opting for an unfit striker to carry the burden alone may have repercussions for the East Midlands side in their first European semi-final. The Englishman has only just returned from a knee injury that kept him out for over a month, getting 102 minutes in his legs since a cameo against Aston Villa. A hamstring injury sustained at the start of 2022, which kept him on the sidelines for a month, means the 35-year-old has featured only five times in the New Year. Indeed, making an out of shape frontman carry the goalscoring responsibility constitutes a risk. Of course, Patson Daka remains an alternative for Rodgers, but the Zambian has looked out of sorts during this ongoing 13-game drought and notably lacked conviction as his scuffed shot at Spurs struck the post. Seven of the aforementioned games have been starts, too, yet the fact he was shot-shy in seven of those 13 games does not bode well for the 23-year-old. Admittedly, Iheanacho has not pulled up trees but he is arguably the logical choice to start in attack alone or alongside a partner if Rodgers plumps for a front two as the Foxes chase a first European final in the club‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúWe need the same character that we‚Äôve shown to get to this stage,‚Äù the manager said before Thursday‚Äôs game. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got experience going into the second leg knowing how to get the job done. ‚ÄúRennes and PSV were difficult games, two really good sides, and we were able to do that. It‚Äôs a similar mentality and a similar thought process.‚Äù Having labelled their Rome mission the biggest game of their season, Rodgers now needs to trust the flawed but decisive Iheanacho at a voluble Olimpico to lead Leicester to an unprecedented final.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/europa-conference-league-will-leicester-city-manager-rodgers/blt578ad6422cb1bfa4,Seye Omidiora,d9cc59ff-8ba9-42b3-8944-9b6ec89ed64a
Ronaldo transfer: Sporting boss Amorim addresses talk of potential homecoming for Man Utd striker,"Sporting CP coach Ruben Amorim has suggested there is no truth to rumours that Cristiano Ronaldo could return to the Portuguese side this summer. Ronaldo has told Manchester United that he wants to leave in the current transfer window to play in the Champions League next season. Primeira Liga side Sporting have been rumoured to be a possible destination for the 37-year-old forward given he came through the club‚Äôs youth system and went on to make 31 senior appearances before leaving for Old Trafford in 2003. But Amorim has said that he has heard nothing about the Lisbon side possibly bringing Ronaldo back, insisting that he is concentrating on preventing his current stars from leaving. ""I've heard that [Ronaldo rumours]. I don't read anything, I don't see anything,"" he said to reporters. ""For me the reality is different, it's keeping my players."" One of the Sporting stars in danger of being snapped up is Matheus Nunes. Liverpool have been linked with a move for the 23-year-old midfielder, who has four years left on his contract at Sporting. But Amorim has confirmed that that the eight-time Portugal international has rejected offers from elsewhere and will not be leaving in the current transfer window. ""I'm glad Matheus Nunes is still here. I'm glad Sporting players, like Nunes, reject offers that [would] change their lives to remain at Sporting,"" the coach added. ""That's my reality. I'm very happy with my squad and my players are the best in the world.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-transfer-sporting-boss-amorim-addresses-talk-of/blte173e11d140cdb20,Peter McVitie,e9958791-c13c-4c67-a534-8674daabc1fd
‚ÄòTry having your sport taken away‚Äô ‚Äì Meet the club making sure women‚Äôs football‚Äôs 50-year ban is not forgotten ,"As around 50 players bundled together on a pitch at Haggerston Park for a photo, the curiosity of a group of young boys nearby was piqued. Each player was sporting a shirt with a distinct art deco design, either in black or green, but it was the number on the back of every single one that prompted one of the boys to ask a question. ""Why do they all say 1921 on the back?"" they asked. The response they got left them rather surprised. This Sunday, December 5, 2021, is the 100th anniversary of the Football Association‚Äôs ban of women‚Äôs football in England ‚Äì a ban that lasted 50 years. To mark it, Goal Diggers FC, a grassroots club in London, has launched a protest kit to educate those who don‚Äôt recognise what a humongous setback it was for the women's game ‚Äì which attracted tens of thousands of fans in the early 20th century. On Sunday, at the Women‚Äôs FA Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea, some 40 members of GDFC will be in the stands at Wembley wearing their eye-catching kit ‚Äì the art deco is a nod to the 1920s, while the green signifies how women are now ‚Äúreclaiming the pitch‚Äù, designer Anastasia Kuchta tells GOAL. The club is not alone in promoting it, either. It‚Äôs in the National Football Museum, England stars are behind it and so are relatives of players from the famous Dick, Kerr Ladies side that marked the era of women‚Äôs football that preceded the ban. The words of one of the stars of that team, Alice Kell, run down the sleeves of GDFC‚Äôs special shirt: ‚ÄúWe play for the love of the game and are determined to go on.‚Äù It‚Äôs a quote that can be related to the club itself, actually, where playing for the love of the game unites 200 members with incredibly different stories. Liz Ward remembers feeling ‚Äúsick with nerves‚Äù at the idea of anyone at school finding out that she was a girl who played football. She stopped for 13 years, then discovered Goal Diggers. Laura Howard-Harman stopped playing around the age of 15 but wanted to get back into things and found GDFC. ‚ÄúI went down for a taster session and it was a breath of fresh air,‚Äù she tells GOAL. ‚ÄúI hadn't kicked a ball in 10 years and nobody cared.‚Äù When Hannah May decided she wanted to start playing properly for the first time at the age of 31, Goal Diggers was the place for her to do that. Now, she plays four times a week. Kuchta grew up in Florida. To regularly hear about the stigma of young women playing football in England is strange to her. ‚ÄúIt's very widely accepted for women to play football,‚Äù she explains, remembering her upbringing in the United States. ‚ÄúIt was actually heavily encouraged.‚Äù All four have different experiences, come from different backgrounds and have different levels of ability, but that they are now part of the same 200-strong club of women and non-binary players sums up the variety that defines the club. Its diversity has increased massively in the six years since it was founded, too. Ward, whose father is from Saint Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, remembers the first time she went along to a session and not seeing many people of colour. ‚ÄúNow, it's so different,‚Äù she tells GOAL. ‚ÄúPeople have different life stories and it's amazing. ‚ÄúThere's women of colour, trans women, non-binary people, black people, Asian people, people from just every single walk of life. That, I think, is the biggest change.‚Äù Ward is part of trying to ensure that continues, taking up a role as an inclusion and diversity officer at the club, which sits nicely alongside the fantastic work she does with Stonewall, the largest LGBTQ+ rights organisation in Europe. She has been involved in launching initiatives and ideas that embody the values that run throughout GDFC, helping to run educational workshops that teach attendees about oppression, identity, intersectionality and just being a better ally. She‚Äôs not alone, either. May, for example, is currently running a Crowdfunder to raise money to buy football shirts for children who might not otherwise get a Christmas present, having teamed up with a charity called Kitmas. Kuchta and Howard-Harman, meanwhile, have been heavily involved with the protest kit and their efforts will be on show for all to see this Sunday. With a record-breaking crowd anticipated for the FA Cup final, there will likely be plenty more people intrigued about the significance of 1921, just like the young boys at Haggerston Park. ‚ÄúI was kind of like, 'Are they taking the p*ss?'‚Äù May remembers. ‚ÄúAnd they were like, 'No, no, what does it mean?' ‚ÄúIt's a really good talking point. Lots of people don't know about it at all. I didn't really know much about it. My niece, who plays football, and my brother, it's something they haven't heard of at all. ‚ÄúI think it's good that we're getting it out there a little bit more.‚Äù  These are exactly the kind of conversations GDFC want to start. With women‚Äôs football regularly subject to criticism, particularly as its place in the spotlight increases, it‚Äôs important to remind those quick to judge of its setback. ‚ÄúThe sport was banned,‚Äù Howard-Harman says. ‚ÄúTherefore, we couldn't play and we couldn't develop. It feels like our sport gets denigrated a little bit because of that. ‚ÄúTry having your thing taken away from you for 50 years. Then see where you're at.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/making-sure-womens-football-50-year-ban-not-forgotten/blt7dc92496e367f861,Amee Ruszkai,eeb9224f-f8a8-4879-b5bf-a997c750633f
Why have Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates fallen so far behind Mamelodi Sundowns?,"Mamelodi Sundowns' dealings in the January transfer window have put more daylight between them and floundering Soweto clubs Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. Increasingly, players are snubbing the likes of Pirates and Chiefs to join Sundowns, and the more successful the Pretoria club are becoming, the more players choose them over the Soweto giants. Worryingly if you're a Chiefs or a Pirates fan, Sundowns seem in danger of pulling further away from the chasing pack. So how has this happened - what have Sundowns done right, and the other clubs done wrong? Money There's no denying it, that to a large extent, Sundowns have bought their way to success. For 15 years now, the club owner and one of Africa‚Äôs richest men, Patrice Motsepe, has been throwing cash at the team. Sundowns have been able to spend large sums bringing in players, and paying the best salaries. In the early years, and even more recently, not all their signings have been successful, and a lot of players have seen their careers stagnating.  But with so much money available, it's never really been a problem and Sundowns have been able to absorb their losses. Other clubs just can't compete with that. Management Since the Pitso Mosimane era (2012 onwards), Masandawana have become an increasingly well-run, well-structured team, with a low turnover in terms of the technical team and management.  There is good stability, there seems to be less interference from upper management when it comes to on-the-field matters, and the continuity of having a coach for eight seasons like was the case with Mosimane, has made a marked difference.  What Downs have done so well is to take the success which Mosimane initially brought, and to build on that, to create a club and players ingrained with a winning culture. With Mosimane's former lieutenants Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena now at the helm, it's proving a difficult train to stop for the opposition. Ambition Motsepe always made it clear that he wanted to conquer not only the PSL, but also Africa, and the world. Aiming so high has helped instil a real culture of excellence at the club.  When it comes to recruitment, Masandawana scour the globe, unlike their rivals who often look local or to Southern African nations for a bargain. Coupled with the innovations and partnerships, not to mention the success of their women's team, it's clear to see that Sundowns are biding by their motto that the ‚ÄòSky Is The Limit‚Äô. How do Bucs and Amakhosi catch up? Money doesn't solve everything, but Chiefs and Pirates are going to have to spend more in the transfer window, and also ensure that they spend wisely, and that their recruitment structures are improved.  The Soweto giants need to look carefully at their behind-the-scenes staff and ask themselves if they have the right people for the job ‚Äì not only for this season but for the next five or 10 years.  With Sundowns, you feel like there is a long term vision. At Chiefs and Pirates, it feels like things have gone stale and are in need of a shake-up, through the two clubs. That Pirates still don‚Äôt even have a permanent head coach says a lot, while Chiefs have also made poor choices in their own player and coach recruitment over the past six or seven years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-have-kaizer-chiefs-and-orlando-pirates-fallen-so-far/bltddb4b209ff725bca,Anthony McLennan,fb6d9489-9f78-49e7-b844-7bbfc991bfe5
Liverpool's Mane joins Rooney in hallowed Premier League ranks with Manchester City goal,"Sadio Mane has become the second player in Premier League history to score on his birthday against a team starting the day top of the table.

Nonetheless, the lead lasted for just eight minutes with Diogo Jota restoring parity for the visiting side thanks to an assist from Trent Alexander-Arnold.¬† In the goal-laden first half, Gabriel Jesus ensured that the hosts went into the half time break with the lead as he beat goalkeeper Alisson in the 36th minute. Knowing that anything short of victory would spell doom in their quest to emerge as league champions, Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side stepped up their game in the second half. Just a minute after resumption, Mane put Liverpool on level terms courtesy of Mohamed Salah‚Äôs last pass.¬† Thanks to that effort, the reigning African Player of the Year joined the Manchester United great in the hallowed ranks of the English top flight with his unique feat. In addition, the goal which came just 46 seconds into the second half was the first time the Anfield kings had scored in the opening minute of the second half in a league game since January 2019 (Mohamed Salah vs Crystal Palace).

Afcon Qualifiers: Ex-Liverpool and Tottenham‚Äôs Caulker on importance of Nigeria duel to Sierra Leone,"Sierra Leone captain Steven Caulker has explained why the Nigeria match will be of particular importance to them during the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification process. Sierra Leone are in Group A with Nigeria, Guinea Bissau, and Sao Tome and Principe. They will start their qualification process with a game against the Super Eagles before facing Guinea-Bissau a few days later. ""We have to be at our best for every game and against Nigeria is an opportunity to put Sierra Leone on the world football map,"" Caulker, on loan to Gaziantep from Fenerbahce in Turkey, said, as quoted by CafOnline. ""I'm sure like we did in the last Afcon, we have to be at our best for all games, not just against Nigeria, we should go into every game with the ambition to win."" As he anticipates a difficult game, the former Liverpool defender pointed out that the Super Eagles will look to recover after they were eliminated by Ghana in the World Cup qualifiers. ""Our qualifying group is going to be tough, obviously Nigeria will be looking to bounce back from their disappointment following their elimination to Ghana in the 2022 World Cup,"" he added. ""The qualifiers will therefore be a way to forget the disappointment, so it will be revengeful and difficult to maneuver around the Nigeria team, which will be in front."" However, the 30-year-old pegged his hopes on the calibre of the players in Sierra Leone‚Äôs team. ""It would be difficult, but I'm excited to start these qualifiers, we have a lot of new talent, new players, a new system, and a new identity,"" the former Tottenham Hotspur defender stated. ""I am really delighted to be able to lead this group in qualifying."" Sierra Leone will play their qualifiers away from home due to the unavailability of approved stadiums, and Caulker rues that they will miss a chance to have the presence of their fans. ""To be honest, I would have loved to play in front of our fans in Sierra Leone, but that's how it is, we have to be ready. It's always good to face the best, it creates that challenge,"" he continued. During the last international break, they played against Liberia and Congo and won 1-0 and 2-1, respectively, after they had lost to Togo by a margin of 3-0 in March. Caulker made his international debut for the Leone Stars in the 0-0 match against Algeria at the Afcon finals in Cameroon earlier this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-qualifiers-ex-liverpool-tottenham-caulker-nigeria/blt1aaf5acf31399891,Kiplagat Sang,395b9c54-f5ef-4d7e-be5b-86d5127a8974
2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Eguavoen insists Nigeria have to respect Ghana,"Nigeria interim coach Augustine Eguavoen believes his charges will have to learn to react fast for them to stand a chance of getting past Ghana in the second leg of the 2022 World Cup play-off to be played on Tuesday. The two nations played out a goalless draw when they met in Kumasi in Friday's first leg. It leaves the meeting at Abuja's Moshood Abiola a decisive one, as the hosts aim at capitalising on home-ground advantage to make it to Qatar. Eguavoen insists his team could have won the first leg, but he is content with the draw. ""Ghana were on top of their game in the first leg but they didn't have any clear-cut chances - but we had two clear-cut chances,"" Eguavoen said as quoted by BBC Sport. ""Ghana are not a pushover, they have a lot of talent. We will keep respecting them and I'm very sure the Ghana team will give us a lot of respect. ""We wanted to win the first leg but if we couldn't win I would have settled for a draw and that's exactly what happened. Our organisation was very good, we combined well in all the lines. ""But we didn't react quickly, so that's something we have to work on because we cannot allow the Ghanaian players freedom on the ball."" Meanwhile, ex-Nigeria international custodian Peter Rufai believes the Super Eagles need an early goal to put the Black Stars under pressure on Tuesday. ""This is going to be a tough encounter, however, our dream of playing at the World Cup is in our hands right here in Abuja. All we need to do is to score an early goal because that will unsettle the Black Stars,"" Rufai told Complete Sports.  ""I am optimistic the Ghanaian side can‚Äôt pull off an upset against us but then, we just have to watch our back so as to prevent any form of counter-attacks.  ""We just have to be clinical in front of goal and punish the Black Stars for every error that they make. This is our game and we must win come Tuesday.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifiers-eguaven-insists-nigeria-have-to/blte0acdb0a10364bac,Seth Willis,69434681-a30d-4b24-a9d7-4f9dcb32892f
"Real Madrid vs Eintracht Frankfurt: Live stream, TV channel, kick-off time & how to watch UEFA Super Cup","Real Madrid will take on Bundesliga outfit Eintracht Frankfurt at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki for the first European silverware of the 2022-23 season in the latest edition of the UEFA Super Cup. The Spanish giants edged out Liverpool in the UEFA Champions League final in May to book their Super Cup berth, while Frankfurt claimed the UEFA Europa League title by beating Glasgow Rangers.  This is the first time that Madrid will be playing a competitive match this season, while Frankfurt head into the game on the back of a crushing 6-1 defeat to Bayern Munich in their Bundesliga opener.  Los Blancos lifted the Super Cup in 2002, 2014, 2016, and 2017 but were defeated by Atletico Madrid in their most recent outing in 2018. Meanwhile, this will be the first appearance for Frankfurt in this continental competition. GOAL has all the details on how you can catch the action live from Helsinki.

However, Reinier Jesus has not been training with the group as he is inching closer to a loan move away from the club.  Ancelotti is likely to stick to the XI he fielded against Juventus in their pre-season encounter. This means that we can expect to see their strongest starting line-up. Indeed, there is also the possibility that the Italian picks the same team that won the Champions League in May. ""The 11 is going to be more like last year's because it's a tournament for winning the Champions League and that has to be taken into account. We have to finish the season by winning the Super Cup,"" Ancelotti has said in the build-up to the clash.

'We are the only club that suffers like this' - Tuchel admits Chelsea takeover has been a 'distraction' amid poor recent form,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel admits the speculation about the club‚Äôs takeover has been a ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù that has contributed to his team's poor recent form. American Todd Boehly, co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is part of a consortium that has beaten a series of rival bidders to complete its takeover of the Premier League club. However, it has taken several weeks to get to this point and Tuchel believes that uncertainty has directly impacted on-pitch performances. Chelsea travel to Leeds on Wednesday having won just one of their last five Premier League matches, and even that was a last-gasp 1-0 win at home to West Ham. Reflecting on his team‚Äôs patchy recent form, Tuchel lamented the takeover talk, telling reporters: ‚ÄúWe are the only club in the moment that suffers like this, maybe the first club that ever did this. It is a situation that is unique and a situation that is quite challenging. ‚ÄúOf course, everybody hopes for the situation to be clarified. These are steps in the right direction. We are waiting for it since a long time. We need the positive energy and competitive atmosphere at the club. It is very important for things to progress.‚Äù Roman Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale at the start of March as he came under increasing pressure due to his alleged ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin amid the country's invasion of Ukraine. A few days later, the UK government imposed sanctions on the Russian billionaire and froze his assets. That news directly affected Chelsea, who needed a special licence from the government in order to continue operating. All that off-field upheaval did not immediately impact on-field performances ‚Äì the team won all six of their matches in March ‚Äì but Tuchel feels the players were slowly affected by the uncertainty as time went on. ‚ÄúIt has for sure [been a distraction]. I think there‚Äôs no sense in hiding from the fact that it is a distraction,‚Äù said the German. ‚ÄúIt is a matter of how much level we can reach up even if we are distracted or worried or disadvantaged by it. We did excellent until the international break, it had no effect in terms of results. It had almost the opposite effect. ""We felt strong during the difficulties and the announcement, the sanctions in place. Maybe something also very human and normal took place, in the moment of two weeks off or one week off with the players not here, there were different influences to them and maybe more thoughts to the situation in general. ""The situation is now very, very long and the players also want to feel competitive and know what‚Äôs going on next season. A player, a guy like Toni [Rudiger] decided to change the club. With everyday it gets a bit more difficult, not impossible. We are still looking to reach the level and be competitive, win games. It is no excuse but for sure is a reason.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-are-the-only-club-that-suffers-like-this-tuchel-admits/blt7866da22a5905bd3,Tom Mallows,ecab6e96-c978-4da4-a5ee-931ab25954d9
Italy players exposed their bare behinds ahead of 2006 World Cup semi-final win against Germany - Lippi,"During a talk with university students on Monday, former Italy manager Marcello Lippi recalled the time he instructed Azzurri players to drop their shorts during a training session amid their 2006 World Cup run. The incident took place just before the semi-final against Germany, which Italy won 2-0 in extra time. Lippi had wanted to put off photographers he suspected were spying on his team's drills. ‚ÄúThe morning of the semi-final with Germany, we were warming up near Dortmund when I saw these flashes of light coming from the trees nearby,"" he recalled, according to Football Italia. ""I suspected some photographers were hiding and trying to get some insider information on our tactics. ‚ÄúSo I told my players about it, asked them to all line up with their backs to the trees and at my command, lean over and pull your shorts down. ‚ÄúThey did it and we all laughed. The fact that no photograph was published suggests there was no photographer, but at least we had fun, an indispensable element for a winning squad. Technical quality alone is not enough if you don‚Äôt have harmony within the group. ‚ÄúThe best coach is not the most competent, but the one that can create the best team spirit.‚Äù The Azzurri entered the tournament having not won since 1982.

VAR saves Man Utd: Why was McTominay not sent off & Maddison's goal disallowed in 1-1 draw with Leicester?,"Manchester United were able to salvage a point in Saturday's Premier League clash against Leicester, largely thanks to the officials. After Kelechi Iheanacho opened the scoring for the visitors at Old Trafford, Fred levelled matters just three minutes later with a goal for the hosts. But, with 10 minutes left on the clock, James Maddison thought he had restored his side's lead and given them the three points, but it was not to be. ‚ùå NO GOAL ‚ùåVAR intervention sees the goal NOT given... https://t.co/BxHym5fagU The James Maddison goal is ruled out due to VAR.

However, the celebration was soon cut short as VAR intervened. Referee Andre Marriner then disallowed the goal after the replay showed that there had been a foul on defender Raphael Varane from Iheanacho in the build-up. There were calls for United midfielder McTominay to be sent off early in the second half. Maddison was again the victim when the Scotland international slid in with what appeared to be a dangerous challenge. McTominay's foot was high as he went in, sending Maddison flying, and the referee called for a foul. Despite the dangerous tackle, McTominay was allowed to stay on the field as he was only given a yellow card as VAR did not intervene further following Marriner's initial decision. He was then substituted six minutes later with Marcus Rashford replacing him.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/var-saves-man-utd-why-was-mctominay-not-sent-off-and/blt3abae443cdee2a90,By Peter McVitie,c3f3045c-bded-4ebc-ad2c-2f744d66878f
Adel Taarabt: The show-pony in London turned happy workhorse in Lisbon,"There is a moment in the 44th minute of the Champions League quarter final first leg between Benfica and Liverpool, where Adel Taarabt, midway inside his own half, takes a clearance, spins deftly into space and fires a lovely floated through ball for Rafa Silva to sprint through. It did not result in a goal, as Silva blazed over under pressure, and it did not prevent Benfica from losing the match and ultimately the pulsating two-legged tie - but it does show how there still remains that trickster dog within Taarabt that thrilled English football fans years ago. Taarabt made his name at QPR as one of the most thrilling players of the early 2010s, with a penchant for a mazy dribble and an eye for a thunderous wondergoal. These days, however, he is to be found patrolling the defensive midfield zones for Portuguese giants - a career change few who watched him in west London would have seen coming. With Taarabt, the rough often comes alongside the smooth - and although in the past a lack of fitness and application have been a regular occurrence, he struggled mightily across the two legs against Liverpool because their midfield three and wide attackers dragged him hither and thither. It was a turning of tables for Taarabt. Certainly those who watched the Championship between 2009 and 2011 will remember that it was he who would have opposition defenders and midfielders on a string. Taarabt was only 17 when he moved to English football from Lens, initially on loan in January 2007 before a permanent transfer that summer. Having starred for his family's adopted home nation of France at youth level, it was something of a coup for a Spurs side, at that time floating closer to mid-table, to secure his signature - and it was one Taarabt would later say he regretted. He told talkSPORT: ‚ÄúI signed for Spurs because when I was in France, for us, we were watching the Premier League but it was the top four. Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Liverpool. ‚ÄúBut to me it was almost all done that I would go to Arsenal and then after Damien Comolli, who was working at [Tottenham], convinced me to come. ‚ÄúAt that time I was playing at France Under-17s and I could have gone to all the big three in any leagues."" Taarabt struggled to break into the Spurs first team picture under either Juande Ramos or Harry Redknapp, so in March 2009 was allowed to sign for QPR, initially on loan. This was where the fun began. A goal Taarabt scored on October 1, 2009 against Preston in the Championship sums up just why he electrified audiences - taking down a skewed goal kick on the touchline around half way,¬† he swivels, beats three men in a jinking run, before slamming into the top corner from 25 yards. Stop that Taarabt.  pic.twitter.com/yz5kGS3Xwp It is a wonder goal in its purest form, a mixture of individual skill and long-range finishing. And it wasn't even until the following season that Taarabt hit the high point of the first half of his career. In 2010-11, Taarabt scored 19 goals and provided 21 assists in 44 Championship fixtures as Neil Warnock's QPR steamrolled their way to the second-tier title. Having been signed permanently for just ¬£1 million from Spurs, he was named the league's player of the season - an accolade absolutely no-one could argue with. This should have been the platform for Taarabt to spring into Premier League stardom, however a turbulent summer turned his head and he was never quite the same again in English football. He was linked with moves throughout the summer, revealing 10 years later how close he came to a switch to PSG. Asked if he was ready to sign for the French champions ahead of the 2011-12 season, Taarabt told GOAL in 2021: ""Yes, after my season when I got promoted, yes, it was all done. ""I was speaking with Nasser [Al-Khelaifi] and we were together but he told me we had to wait because Leonardo will be arriving from Inter, but it didn't happen because of fees. I was already in Paris waiting."" With his mind elsewhere, Taarabt failed to shine in the Premier League, scoring only twice in 27 games during 2011-12 as QPR only avoided relegation on the final day. He slightly improved the following campaign with five goals and five assists from 33 league games, but it was not enough for them to evade the drop this time. All was not well behind the scenes either - Redknapp, the man who sold Taarabt from Spurs, had taken over as QPR manager. The club spent wildly and erratically in an attempt to stave off relegation, and their former talisman was not shy about making his opinions heard. Taarabt said: ""Half the players at QPR didn‚Äôt care about the club, they were just making money. I had one of the bigger salaries but I cared about football because I loved football. ‚ÄúWhen I came for pre-season I told Redknapp to his face, ‚ÄòThis team is going down‚Äô. He said the same thing as me, that he agreed with me. ""I don‚Äôt think he [Redknapp] has the passion for the game like people think. Harry is not a bad person but he is a very bad coach and, for me, a very bad manager.‚Äù Thus began Taarabt's nomadic years. Loan spells at Fulham and AC Milan, a fleeting return to QPR where Redknapp criticised his fitness, before a ‚Ç¨4m switch to Benfica whereupon he failed to play a single first team minute for a season and a half, and was loaned to Genoa for 18 months. Since early 2019 however, things have changed. The coach of Benfica B, Bruno Lage, was put in charge of the first team, and took Taarabt with him. Now the other side of 30, he was deployed as the elder statesman anchoring the midfield while the young bucks, including a certain Darwin Nunez, caused havoc up top. He told The Athletic of his new role:¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a different area, where you cannot risk so much. In England I was free, and the only thing asked of me was to create. Now I work on both sides, trying to create and defend as well. ""I have to be very disciplined. I don‚Äôt arrive around the box, I do get there, but I am more the third-last pass. It is more about making the team play."" And so Taarabt enters the final stage of his career a calmer figure than that which most will recognise or remember. But as that one pass proved, true entertainers never quite lose that knack.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/adel-taarabt-trickster-in-london-statesman-in-lisbon/bltb6e9f1e2b35d6708,Emma Smith,fc41f694-a7ba-4893-8eba-7f0954422687

Rooney to stay at Derby despite relegation: I want to rebuild the club,"Wayne Rooney says he wants to stay and help ""bring the happy days back"" to Derby County after the Rams were relegated from the Championship to League One. Defeat against Queens Park Rangers and a draw for Reading against Swansea means that the Pride Park outfit will drop to the third tier of English football next season, after failing to outrun a 21-point deduction for falling into administration. Former England great Rooney has led the club in a valiant battle throughout the campaign to escape a fate many felt they would succumb to far earlier - but even now the news is confirmed, the ex-player-coach says he hopes to remain onboard to help them rebuild. ""We've been relegated, but I've never seen a team get relegated and [get] the reaction of the fans,"" Rooney told Sky Sports after the final whistle. ""I thought it was incredible, the support the fans gave the lads all season. Of course, [I'm] disappointed, sad, upset - but [I'm] proud."" ""In some ways, we can draw a line under what's happened and really start the rebirth of this club and try to move forward.  ""I want to rebuild the club. You see what it means to the fans every week, this is a special club, a big club and we're all proud to be here. I want to be the one to bring the happy days back."" Derby look poised to welcome new owners as they prepare for life in the third tier, but the prolonged process and uncertainty means that the club are effectively in limbo - and Rooney admits that he fears what will happen if a deal falls through.

Does the Carabao Cup winner qualify for Europe?,"The Carabao Cup may be English football's second-tier cup competition after the FA Cup, but there is still plenty of excitement and reward that comes with it.

Since 2020‚Äì21, however, the rule was changed so that the winners earned a place in the Europa Conference League. If the winner of the Carabao Cup has already qualified for a European competition through their league finish (such as placing above fifth in the domestic league or winning either the Champions League or Europa League), the Europa Conference spot reserved for the Carabao Cup winner goes to the highest-placed Premier League side that has not already qualified. For example, if Manchester City win the Carabao Cup but have already been assured of European football for the next season after finishing first in the Premier League, the Europe Conference spot would go to the seventh-placed Premier League team. The sixth-placed Premier League team earns the right to qualify for the Europa Conference play-off spot already.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/does-the-carabao-cup-winner-qualify-for-europe/bltd5a59caa6a43f5df,Cady Siregar,1ac5056c-a45f-41b3-965a-d97022e581c1
Klopp: Salah won't be affected by Haaland & Nunez battle for Premier League Golden Boot,"Jurgen Klopp does not believe the presence of Erling Haaland at Manchester City will impact Mohamed Salah's goal tally in the Premier League and hopes the forward can score over 35 goals this season. The Egypt star finished last term with 23 goals in the English top-flight, sharing the Golden Boot with Tottenham attacker Son Heung-min. The 30-year-old may be in with even more competition for the top scorer spot in the division in 2022-23, however, after Liverpool added Darwin Nunez to the squad this summer and goal machine Haaland was snapped up by City. Asked if the arrivals of Haaland and Darwin Nunez will motivate Salah to score more, Klopp told reporters: ""Maybe but that is just talk, you should not think all the things you make up as a story are immediately important to us.  ""New strikers are coming. In Germany when Robert Lewandowski left, [the talk was]: 'Who will be the new goalscorer?' That is what they discussed.  ""I don't know, people are motivated by different things, I think Mo‚Äôs biggest motivation is to win football games and to score, that is definitely the case.  ""I don't think he thinks too often about other players or how often they score. He might do it in May when he has hopefully 34 or 35 and the other two have 32. Before then I can't see that."" Salah had been linked with a move away from Liverpool as negotiations over a new contract dragged on. The attacker had entered the last year of his deal and could have left the club for free next summer, but he eventually committed his future to the Anfield side by signing an extension that runs until 2025. Klopp believes Salah would have been equally committed to the Liverpool cause had he not signed his new contract, but says the signing will now help them avoid so much speculation in the press. ""It is of course much better than if we would have been out of contract next summer,"" he added.  ""Mo would have been the same person, I am 100 per cent sure he could have pushed that aside, but you would not stop asking and that is the problem we constantly face.  ""You asked me how he was in training and it's because 'ah, the contract'. You ask the players and they say 'yesterday he was all right' but these things help, yes.¬† ""It helps much better to know exactly as much as possible about the season after rather than one year, but in the year itself it is not that relevant.  ""I have worked with players in that and not seen it one day and I, as a player, would have been more influenced by this fact that I don't know where I am next year than these players were.  ""It was Gini [Georginio Wijnaldum], Emre Can, it was [Robert] Lewandowski at Dortmund, these boys are real professionals, but we live in a world where everything is important and you have questions all the time and you give an answer and then you think about it and that is different because we all know exactly where we all will be.""¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-salah-won-t-be-affected-haaland-nunez-battle-premier/bltb073e215af39f71c,Peter McVitie,564fd178-f4a9-47a0-ba3c-d58eb7f85952
"Rangnick explains why he started Pogba, not Rashford, in attack in Man Utd's draw vs Leicester","Ralf Rangnick has explained why he decided to play Paul Pogba in attack in Manchester United's draw against Leicester instead of Marcus Rashford. The Red Devils boss had a tough call to make as Cristiano Ronaldo was ruled out of the clash because of illness, while Edinson Cavani is injured. Rashford was the only recognised forward available for the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, but he had to make do with a place on the bench as Pogba was given the nod. Rashford came on to replace Scott McTominay for the last 35 minutes of the match, with Rangnick admitting he did not want to put him in the starting XI because of his lack of confidence. ""The only [attacker] we had was Marcus Rashford,"" he told Sky Sports. Heads up, we have to fight until the last game and we will do it! üî¥¬†#MUFC pic.twitter.com/mCcXB1ilLX ""We knew this morning Cristiano could not play and decided to start Paul Pogba. After 60 minutes we made the change and had a central striker on the pitch. ""It is no secret that he was not full of confidence in the last couple of weeks. In training he is looking well but it was a question between Paul and Marcus, we went with Paul."" Rangnick added to BBC Match of the Day: ""It was a difficult time for him. I had to decide between two options and I think I decided for the one that gave us more stability in midfield, which was true until the goal."" Harry Maguire kept his place in the United defence in the wake of a difficult week for the centre-back. The defender was jeered by England fans as he lined up for the national team in midweek and he has faced heavy criticism because of his performances for United. But Rangnick was happy with his display against the Foxes and praised the club's fans for their treatment of him. ""I think he played well,"" he said. ""I decided for him to play on the right side of defence after seeing him play for England there. For me, it was a solid performance from him."" He added: ""The reaction of our supporters and they are the best in England. Harry Maguire had a flawless game defensively and offensively. ""He prefers to play on the left side but I decided he should play on the right after seeing him for England and as a right-footed player it makes it easy to play.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rangnick-explains-started-pogba-not-rashford-striker-man-utd/blte83a7bbfc042d19d,By Peter McVitie,ca478612-43ca-42bc-b388-350deaa47dd5
'I love you my brother!' - De Gea gives Mata emotional Man Utd tribute as longtime team-mates part ways,"David De Gea has posted a heartfelt tribute to Juan Mata after it was confirmed the midfielder would leave Manchester United after eight years this summer. The ex-Spain international arrived at the club in 2014 and was one of the key figures on the pitch of the post-Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford. The veteran moves on now in search of further game-time however, following Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard through the door - and now goalkeeper De Gea has reflected on his time alongside the playmaker in emotional terms. ""Thought this would be a very difficult one to express into words but when I thought about it more, the main feeling I am left with is happiness,"" De Gea wrote in a lengthy Instagram post. ""This guy has been a teammate, a friend and is my family. The ultimate professional, one of the best players and people you could have grace your life. I‚Äôm so thankful to have been on so many journeys with you, happy that our paths crossed, and we shared a dressing room together. ""I love you my brother, I wish you everything and absolutely nothing but joy and success in your next stage of an unbelievable career."" A Champions League winner with Chelsea and World Cup and European Championship victor with Spain before his arrival at Old Trafford, Mata landed at the Theatre of Dreams as David Moyes' flagship mid-season purchase in January 2014. During his time with United, he made 285 appearances across all competitions, and played in all three major silverware triumphs of his tenure - the 2016 FA Cup Final under Louis van Gaal and the 2017 EFL Cup and Europa League triumphs under Jose Mourinho. He cut an increasingly peripheral figure under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and successor Ralf Rangnick however, playing just 30 times across the past two seasons combined.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-love-you-my-brother-de-gea-gives-mata-emotional-man-utd/blt2209b0a26bfd8246,Andrew Steel,77608b4a-f40e-453d-a6e1-829d59aad70f
Chelsea captain Azpilicueta explains why he wanted Barcelona transfer before contract U-turn,"Cesar Azpilicueta admits he was tempted to join Barcelona this summer because he wanted to return to Spain to take on a new challenge before deciding to sign a new contract at Chelsea. Barcelona had been trying to sign the Blues captain for some time and a move to Camp Nou seemed imminent. However, the 32-year-old opted to commit his future to Chelsea by penning a contract that runs until 2024. Spain international Azpilicueta has been with Chelsea for 10 years and has won every major trophy available in that time, including two Premier League titles, the Champions League and Club World Cup among many others. After conquering the world with Chelsea, Azpilicueta considered taking on a new challenge as he explained his flirtation with Barca.   ""I‚Äôm always totally honest and the conversations were there. I thought after the Club World Cup, winning this trophy and being the first player at Chelsea to win every single trophy available, that perhaps it was time to go back to Spain, maybe for a new challenge,"" he told the club's website. ""But then everything happened, we had some really good conversations with the manager and the owners. I‚Äôm the captain of this club and I wanted to stay committed to Chelsea. ""The conversations we had will remain private, but we had some really good communications, we said what we thought and then I realised that I wanted to continue to help my club."" Azpilicueta says the UK government's sanctions on the club because of previous owner Roman Abramovich's ties to Russia president Vladimir Putin had an effect on his situation. Chelsea were not able to hold talks over a new contract with the ex-Marseille star until a new owner came in, but he is happy he stuck around for the takeover by new co-owner Todd Boehly and is convinced he made the right decision by extending his stay. ""I‚Äôm really happy to sign the new contract,"" he said. ""The last few months have been a little crazy but I‚Äôm really happy to extend my stay here. It‚Äôs a new project and I‚Äôm really looking forward to the season ahead. ""It was quite a rare situation in the sense that I was coming out of contract and then the club were sanctioned in March, so nothing could be done at that time with regards to speaking about an extension, so it was difficult. ""Everybody can speak a lot about your name [in the media] but the actions I think speak louder. I stayed committed to my club, I played the games as best as I could even though I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen. ""Then the new ownership group arrived, we had a very honest conversation and I decided that I was right to stay home here at Chelsea.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-azpilicueta-wanted-barcelona-transfer-contract-u/bltb276709f579017f6,Peter McVitie,4ba4dff8-c233-4bc4-b763-8718d8dda251
'It's unreal' - USMNT star Busio enjoying life in Serie A after helping Venezia to Juventus draw,"Venezia's United States international Gianluca Busio admitted that he can barely believe his luck in playing against Serie A's elite, after his team took a hard-earned point against Juventus on Saturday.  Mattia Aramu's second-half strike earned the hosts a 1-1 draw, after Alvaro Morata had fired Juve ahead.  It marked a serious setback to the Old Lady's title prospects - but a day to remember for Busio and his team-mates.  ""It's special, it's always been a goal of mine to play at the highest level and to do it in such a beautiful place as this is unreal,"" the 19-year-old told CBS when asked about life in Venice, one of the world's most famed tourist destinations thanks to its canals and stunning architecture.  ""I'm happy to be here and hopefully we can be here for a lot more seasons.""  Busio, a native of Greensboro, North Carolina, received his big break in MLS with Sporting Kansas City before moving to newly-promoted Venezia in August 2021 for a reported initial fee of $6.5 million.  The Venetians went up from Serie B to secure their first season in the top flight since 2001-02, and are so far making a decent fist of life back among the elite.  After 17 games of the 2021-22 campaign they lie 16th, six points clear of Genoa in the final relegation spot.  Busio has been almost ever-present for the club, missing out only in the first game of the season against Napoli due to visa issues.

Morocco 2-1 Malawi: Hakimi douses Flames as Atlas Lions book Afcon quarter-final spot,"Youssef En-Nesyri and Achraf Hakimi led Morocco‚Äôs spirited comeback to inspire their side to the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals following a 2-1 victory over Malawi in Tuesday‚Äôs Round of 16 clash at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium.  Frank Mhango‚Äôs seventh-minute goal for Malawi‚Äôs magnificent attack counted little as En-Nesyri cancelled it in the first-half stoppage time before Hakimi struck the winner with 20 minutes to go. It was an evening of fantastic goals, starting with Orlando Pirates star Mhango. Malawi went in front seven minutes into the contest courtesy of Mhango‚Äôs sensational strike after being set up by John Banda before unleashing a long-range wonder.  It was the Pirates man‚Äôs third goal of the tournament, following a brace against Zimbabwe in the group phase. But Mhango‚Äôs goal triggered Morocco‚Äôs relentless response and Hakimi then forced Malawi goalkeeper Charles Thomu to spill a harmless-looking cross four minutes later, only to be saved by Dennis Chembezi‚Äôs clearance as the opponents‚Äô forwards waited to pounce. It was the start of Thomu‚Äôs busy evening and, shortly after, he was invited to impressively save Watford midfielder Imran Louza‚Äôs shot, before En-Nesyri‚Äôs turn-and-shot sailed narrowly wide. Amid all the pressure, Malawi managed to launch an attack, with Mhango breaking loose on 22 minutes, but he missed the target from an acute angle. Thomu was to be invited again to make a fine save, but this time, saving Hakimi‚Äôs free-kick. Danger continued to lurk for the Flames who had to thank the crossbar for denying a Romain Saiss free-kick in the 33rd minute. Malawi then survived another attack and the woodwork saved them again with six minutes to the break, before Sofiane Boufal had an effort repulsed by Thomu. Angers attacker Boufal was back on 42 minutes but blasted his effort over the bar from close range. The Atlas Lions‚Äô persistence finally paid off when En-Nesyri beat Thomu with a close-range header after jumping the highest. But Morocco came back from half-time having slowed down their tempo but still enjoyed better possession.  Morocco went ahead thanks to Hakimi‚Äôs free-kick which went through the top corner and gave Thomu no chance. It was the Paris Saint-Germain full-back‚Äôs second straight free-kick conversion in this tournament after another well-taken strike in their last match against Gabon.  En-Nesyri then missed the target by a whisker on 77 minutes after being set up by Mmaee in what was a good opportunity to push his side further ahead. The Atlas Lions will now face Wednesday‚Äôs winner between Egypt and Ivory Coast, while Malawi should be going home with their heads held high after reaching the Afcon knockout phase for the first time ever.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/morocco-2-1-malawi-atlas-lions-douse-flames-and-book-afcon/blt71f8b5b7991136ef,Michael Madyira,9a55becc-950a-495d-bea3-4a5280a2921d
Watch: Fired-up Ibrahimovic accidentally breaks Milan bus windscreen ahead of crucial Serie A clash with Atalanta,"A fired-up Zlatan Ibrahimovic accidentally broke Milan's team bus windscreen ahead of their crucial Serie A clash with Atalanta. Milan picked up a vital three points at San Siro on Sunday as they beat Atalanta 2-0 to move to within just one point of sealing their first Scudetto since 2011. Ibrahimovic was an unused substitute for the clash, but he played his part in getting the squad motivated on their way to the stadium, inadvertently causing damage to the team bus in the process. Hundreds of Milan supporters lined the streets outside San Siro as the team closes in on the Serie A crown, and Ibrahimovic moved next to the driver at the front of the bus to get a better look.

Mido: The tumultuous career of an Egyptian golden boy turned Afcon villain,"Inspired by star man Mo Salah, and helped by a stingy defence and prowess at penalties, Egypt are back in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations, in the hope of recapturing the taste for victory which saw them gobble up successive continental titles in 2006, 2008 and 2010. For Egypt, the similarities between the current finalists and the three-time winners of a decade ago are few, although looking to a star forward for inspiration is one of them. While Salah is a team player, however, the north African nation's main man in 2006, Mido, let them down in a massive meeting with Senegal in the semi-finals. Mido was, at the start of his career, the golden child of Egyptian football. He moved to Gent aged 17, overcoming homesickness to earn a transfer to Ajax, however he fell out of favour with Ronald Koeman over a perceived lack of professionalism. ""In his own country, he is seen as a superstar but he must be aware that he has a lot to learn and needs to be reminded about what it means to play for a club like Ajax,"" said Koeman in 2003. ""If I put him on the bench, he must work hard in order to earn respect."" After spells all across Europe with Celta Vigo, Marseille and Roma, Mido landed in his sixth European club in his sixth different country when he joined Tottenham, on an initial 18-month loan deal in January 2005. He hit the ground running as he scored twice on his Spurs debut, against Portsmouth. ‚ÄúThe quick adoption I had with all the clubs I played for being because of my personality: I enter every dressing room with great self-confidence ‚Äì and that helped me a lot,‚Äù Mido said in an interview with The Set Pieces. Mido scored 11 goals in 27 league matches in his first full season at Spurs. However, it was during this league campaign that he went to the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt, and his most infamous moment of indiscipline occurred during the last-four showdown with Senegal. Mido had already been in hot water with the national team two years earlier under former manager Marco Tardelli, when he rejected a call-up due to injury only to play for Roma in a friendly the next day. He had to issue an apology to regain his place in the national team. In the 2006 semi, Mido was subbed by coach Hassan Shehata with the score at 1-1, and proceeded to have a stand-up row with the boss both on and at the side of the pitch as the game continued. Mido called Hassan a ""donkey"", to which the boss replied, ""No! It is you who is the donkey."" ""I was angry when Shehata decided to replace me,""Mido said afterwards. ""I was not that bad and if I had stayed on I would have scored a goal. I am sorry for the fans but I am not sorry for Shehata."" Mido's replacement, Amr Zaki, scored the winner against Senegal and Egypt went on to win the final on penalties. Mido did return after a six-month suspension, and went on to reach 50 caps, but he was not part of Egypt's other two Afcon-winning squads, and that game against Senegal was his last at a major tournament, aged only 22. The aftermath to this ugly incident seemed to effect Mido's performances on the pitch. He only netted one Premier League goal in 2006-07 after signing a permanent deal with Spurs, and angered manager Martin Jol when he labelled former Spurs man Sol Campbell ‚Äúone of the easiest defenders I‚Äôve played against‚Äù. He was eventually sold to Middlesbrough for ¬£6 million ($8.1m) in 2007 but despite scoring on his debut again, he struggled with injuries and lack of game time for a side which two years later were relegated from the Premier League. ""I made a big mistake leaving Spurs for Middlesbrough,‚Äù he told The Set Pieces. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt patient enough to play a match and not play the next one. ""But the main reason that I didn‚Äôt click right with Middlesbrough is that when I got injured, they signed Afonso Alves, without being patient. ""He became No.1 all of a sudden. They changed their minds quickly once I got injured and wanted to save their season. When Alves came, I got injured and didn‚Äôt feel that I got the same attention as I should have."" Following loan spells with Wigan and West Ham, plus brief returns to both Zamalek and Ajax, along with a bizarre, solitary appearance at Barnsley, Mido retired in 2013 at the age of 30, and started suffering from horrendous weight issues, about which he has spoken with impressive candour. ‚ÄúI was 150kg and I reached a point where I couldn‚Äôt walk 30 yards,‚Äù Mido told The Guardian in 2018. ‚ÄúIf I did, I started to feel pain in my back, my joints and my knees. ""I remember I was getting off my boat in Egypt five months ago ‚Äì this day is the turning point in my life ‚Äì and I was walking off on to an island. ""I had three friends with me and it was 300 yards to the end of the island. The sand was a bit heavy and it was a bit sunny and I said to them: ‚ÄòI cannot walk.‚Äô ""I had to sit for 30 minutes. I was only 34. That was the moment the switch flicked."" After being warned by a doctor he was on course to die before he turned 40, Mido cut fried food, red meat, salt and sugar from his diet, and reportedly lost 37 kg in five months. Later this month, on February 21, he will turn 39, now hopefully with many more happy and healthy years ahead of him. He has had several spells in management, coaching various clubs in Egypt and Saudi Arabia ‚Äì including boyhood team Zamalek twice, where he won the Egyptian Premier League and the national cup twice in his first stint. However, Mido is now more likely to be found working as a television pundit, covering Egypt's run at Afcon, or entertaining his 5.6 million followers on Twitter.

Savic told he‚Äôs in ‚Äòwrong sport‚Äô if he can‚Äôt handle name calling as Wright-Phillips reflects on Atletico Madrid vs Man City brawl,"Stefan Savic, who sparked an unsightly brawl towards the end of Atletico Madrid‚Äôs Champions League quarter-final tie with Manchester City that carried over into the tunnel, has been warned by former Blues star Shaun Wright-Phillips that he is in ‚Äúthe wrong sport‚Äù if he cannot handle a bit of name calling. Tempers boiled over late on during another feisty continental clash between Premier League and La Liga heavyweights, with Felipe being shown a red card before Savic appeared to push his head into that of Raheem Sterling after initially trying to remove an injured Phil Foden from the field. The ex-City defender did not stop there as he went on to pull the hair of Jack Grealish, who hit back with a volley of expletives, and Wright-Phillips says the Spanish title holders let themselves down in a show of emotion which left them looking like ‚Äúsore losers‚Äù. Quizzed by GOAL on the chaotic scenes which marred a 1-0 aggregate victory for City that has carried them into the semi-finals of elite European competition, Wright-Phillips ‚Äì who was speaking in association with Lord Ping ‚Äì said: ‚ÄúThose sorts of games will always be feisty, but there is a way to handle it. ‚ÄúJack handled it perfectly for me, just called him a name.

He should know that old saying ‚Äòsticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me‚Äô. ‚ÄúIf he can‚Äôt live with that then realistically he is in the wrong sport.

Wright-Phillips added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an emotional game. Once you are emotionally invested in it, sometimes you do lose your way. But I thought that City handled themselves well and correctly. ‚ÄúI saw a comment from Koke on the ‚Äògamesmanship‚Äô ‚Äì there was no gamesmanship, he [Felipe] has clearly kicked him [Foden] and if he looks back at the replay he will clearly see what happened. And it‚Äôs from a player that should have been sent off in the first 30 minutes, but got away with it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the ref handled the game particularly well and he could have put a lot of fires out before they started. ‚ÄúI think they kept their cool and their professionalism. That was bad form from Atletico Madrid, they just looked like sore losers. ‚ÄúIn the game at the Etihad they did the same thing, started kicking people. We have gone to their place and kept a clean sheet, no matter how much they threw at us. They did have stages in that game, which was to be expected, but City professionally batted them away and did what they had to do. ‚ÄúTo see that at the end of the game, it kind of spoiled what City had achieved because it‚Äôs what everyone keep talking about ‚Äì that whole crazy scene.‚Äù With City having moved a step closer to Champions League glory in Madrid, their attention can now be shifted back to domestic matters.

'Fernandes gets away with murder!' - Man Utd midfielder questioned for early season performances,"Bruno Fernandes has been heavily criticised by Gabby Agbonlahor, with the talkSPORT pundit calling the Manchester United midfielder the ""worst possible teammate"" who ""gets away with murder"". After a lightning start to his United career, Fernandes endured an underwhelming 2021-22 campaign and has been frustrated early this term. The 27-year-old has participated in two losses to begin the season: a 2-1 defeat to Brighton and a 4-0 humiliation at the hands of Brentford. The latter result has been described as the nadir of United's recent history with Harry Maguire, Scott McTominay and David de Gea among the other players whose faults have also been discussed in recent days.  ‚ÄúHow managers can they go through? It‚Äôs easy to point at Maguire, easy to point at Ronaldo, Rashford, Sancho,‚Äú he told the GameDay Phone In. ‚ÄúFor me, Fernandes, since he‚Äôs been in the Premier League, yes he‚Äôs had great stats, goalscoring and assists but he looks like the worst teammate. Every time a player gives it away, every time he gives it away, he throws his arms up at his teammates, he throws his arms up at the bench.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve played with players like him, you‚Äôd be fuming at him. He‚Äôll press now and then. If that was Paul Pogba they would be slaughtering Pogba in the media. Fernandes gets away with murder. Did you see Fernandes do anything?  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember the last time he had a decent game. He‚Äôs always the one that‚Äôs throwing his arms up in the air. Even when he gives it away.  ‚ÄúHe could pass it to you but pass it out of play and he‚Äôd blame you. That‚Äôs the sort of player Fernandes is. The worst possible teammate.‚Äù Despite his struggles over the past year, Fernandes' place in the United team has never been at risk, with the midfielder making 73 Premier League appearances over the past two full seasons. Erik ten Hag has not indicated a change in those plans, though the signing of attacking midfielder Christian Eriksen gives him an alternative option if the manager chooses not to deploy the Denmark and Portugal internationals together in the starting line-up.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fernandes-gets-away-with-murder-man-utd-midfielder/bltff0dec562dc00d10,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,190fa202-5172-4216-a775-c18bf05f49ee
Man City debut Aguero-inspired training kit in tribute to former striker's title clinching goal against QPR,"Manchester City have debuted a new Sergio Aguero-inspired training kit, as a tribute to their former striker's title-clinching goal against QPR in 2012. Aguero scored one of the most famous goals in Premier League history at the end of the 2011-12 season, firing home a stoppage-time winner for City to complete a dramatic comeback. The Manchester outfit secured their maiden title thanks to the strike and have now unveiled a new jersey paying homage to the Argentine, whose ten-year career at the club came to an end last summer. City's new training kit features a white base with the club's traditional light blue added in horizontal stripes, and includes gold detailing around the badge. Images of Aguero's iconic goal are also visible in the light blue. Man City have partnered with Puma for the release of the limited-edition 93:20 pre-match jersey, while they have also unveiled special-edition football boots that include the same colour palette as those worn by the striker against QPR. Pep Guardiola's side wore the strip for the first time while warming up before their 5-0 home victory over Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday, marking the ten-year anniversary of the goal in style.  The 93:20 kit will officially go on sale to the general public in Puma stores and City's club shop on May 13. üåü ICONIC üåüTap to read more about our limited-edition 93:20 pre-match jersey and ULTRA @pumafootball boots to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of @aguerosergiokun's legendary goal that will forever be a part of the Club's history! ‚èÆüíô Aguero scored 260 goals for City between 2011 and 2021, becoming their all-time record scoring in the process, and joined Barcelona on a free transfer following the expiration of his final contract. The 33-year-old was forced into premature retirement in December due to a heart condition, but recalls the time he spent in Manchester fondly and has been moved by their latest tribute. ‚ÄúThis is a great honour for me.

Haaland‚Äôs hero Michu predicts Barcelona transfer for Borussia Dortmund striker,"Erling Haaland has admitted in the past to idolising former Swansea and Celta Vigo striker Michu, with the ex-Spain international claiming to have been offered indications by the prolific Borussia Dortmund striker that a summer transfer to Barcelona could be on the cards. Speculation regarding a switch to Spain for the talented 21-year-old continues to build, with the general consensus being that he has outgrown his surroundings at Dortmund and is ready for a new challenge. Haaland has hinted as much and Michu, who has seen his iconic goal celebration mimicked by the Norwegian, believes Camp Nou could be a useful landing spot for the hot prospect if Kylian Mbappe ends up leaving Paris Saint-Germain for Real Madrid. Michu, who is now sporting director at Spanish second-tier outfit Burgos, told Qu√® t'hi jugues of his discussions with one of the most sought-after players on the planet: ‚ÄúI was with Haaland, I had a conversation with him and I think he is not going to continue at Dortmund. ‚ÄúHaaland is looking for a very strong team that can compete in the Champions League. He is looking for a competitive team. ‚ÄúHe gave me the feeling that he was looking for a sporting project that will last for many years and he told me that he liked Spain. He is thinking more about a sporting project than the economic issue. ‚ÄúIf Mbappe goes to Madrid, I think Barca would be a very good option. In these times, Haaland is a bargain.‚Äù Real Madrid have also been heavily linked with Haaland as they prepare to bring more Galacticos onto their books. It has been suggested that, with Mbappe set to become available as a free agent, two superstar attackers could be acquired by the Blancos in the same window. A move to England has also been speculated on, with Haaland boasting plenty of admirers in the Premier League. Manchester United have been monitoring his progress for some time, while there has been talk of a global icon following in the footsteps of his father Alf Inge at Manchester City. No decision on his next move has been taken as yet, but a contract in Germany that was intended to run through to 2024 will not be seen out.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-hero-michu-barcelona-transfer-borussia-dortmund/blt8bdaeab90619e278,Chris Burton,74f75872-329c-4ead-8627-7a45781f18f3
"Spurs boss Conte: 100 per cent is not enough from Kane, Son and Lloris","Antonio Conte said that stars Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Hugo Lloris will have to give ""130 per cent"" if Tottenham are to reach their goal of finishing in the top four this season. Spurs are currently eighth in the Premier League but, with Conte at the helm, the goal will always be to finish near the top of the league. And he says that to do so, he'll need his stars to go above and beyond by giving more than 100%. ""If you want to have a hope to fight until the end for this type of target, this is the moment I have to ask a lot to the big players,"" Conte said. ""To Harry, Hugo and Sonny. These players have to lead the situation to keep us until the end there.¬† ""At the moment, experience is very important. We don't have a lot of experience in this team and it's right to ask the players with experience and big talent to give everything. ""I think they're giving everything but 100 per cent is not enough. We need to ask 120, 130 per cent to have this type of target. ""It will be very important to have people with great talent to lead us until the end and to try to be very close to reach this target."" As things stand, Spurs sit eighth in the league, six points behind rivals Arsenal for fourth place. Manchester United, West Ham and Wolves also sit between them and that final Champions League spot, and Conte conceded Arsenal are the favourites at the moment while adding that much could change in the coming weeks. ""I think that in this moment, Arsenal seems favourite for fourth place - and United, but don't forget there's also West Ham and don't forget Wolverhampton,"" Conte said. ""They're having a fantastic season and they're in the same position. ""In England, it's not easy, it's not simple. When you start the season normally you think it's four top clubs that at the end, these four teams go to the Champions League: United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool.

"Barcelona are not direct rivals for Real Madrid, says Ancelotti","Carlo Ancelotti does not see Barcelona as Real Madrid's direct rivals this season because they are too low down the table. The Camp Nou side sit eighth in La Liga after 16 matches, trailing leaders Madrid by 18 points. Despite his side's struggles this term, Barca coach Xavi insists they are still in the fight for the Spanish league title, but Ancelotti is not worried about losing out to their Clasico counterparts. Asked about Xavi's comments at a press conference on Saturday, Ancelotti says the likes of Sevilla and Real Betis pose more of a threat than Barcelona. ""Barca are not direct rivals now, because there are other teams closer like Sevilla or Betis,"" he said. ""But they have the quality to move up the table and if I were Barcelona's coach, I would say exactly the same as Xavi."" Ancelotti's men are on a 13-game unbeaten run in all competitions, having won each of their last 10. They sit eight points clear of second-placed Sevilla in the Spanish top-flight, though Julen Lopetegui's team have a game in hand. Madrid will take on Cadiz in La Liga on Sunday, but will be without several players because of an outbreak of Covid-19 cases in the squad.

'Stand up now and speak!' - Ronaldo urged to clarify Man Utd future by Neville amid 'crisis' situation,"Gary Neville has called on his former Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo to ""stand up now and speak"" as speculation continues over his Old Trafford future. Earlier in the summer, Ronaldo informed the club that he wanted to leave, but he has not explained his position to supporters in the weeks that have followed. After United's humiliating 4-0 defeat at the hands of Brentford on Saturday, the legendary forward appeared to further jeopardise his relationship with the United faithful, refusing to applaud the travelling fans at full time. Despite his apparent desire to leave, Ronaldo has blasted the media for ""telling lies"" about him this summer and vowed to set the record straight ""in a couple of weeks"". However, Neville sees no reason for Ronaldo to wait until then, and has urged the 37-year-old to show some leadership in a message to his followers on social media. ""Why does the greatest player of all time (in my opinion) have to wait two weeks to tell Manchester United fans the truth? Stand up now and speak,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""The club is in crisis and it needs leaders to lead. He‚Äôs the only one who can grab this situation by the scruff of the neck!""

Initially, United had been insistent on Ronaldo seeing out the remainder of his current deal, which expires at the end of the season. However, GOAL understands that Erik ten Hag has been so alarmed by the club's terrible start to the campaign, he is willing to sanction the Portugal international's departure.

Football salutes 'legend' Tom Brady as NFL icon confirms retirement,"Two codes of football united on Tuesday to say farewell to a legend, after NFL idol Tom Brady announced his retirement from the game.

Now, after 22 seasons at the top of the NFL, he is hanging up his helmet following the Buccaneers' play-off exit in 2022. ""I have always believed the sport of football is an 'all-in' proposition -- if a 100% competitive commitment isn't there, you won't succeed, and success is what I love so much about our game,"" Brady explained in a series of social media posts. ""There is a physical, mental and emotional challenge every single day that has allowed me to maximize my highest potential. And I have tried my very best these past 22 years. There are no shortcuts to success on the field or in life.  ""This is difficult for me to write, but here it goes: I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore. I have loved my NFL career, and now it is time to focus my time and energy on other things that require my attention.  ""I've done a lot of reflecting the past week and have asked myself difficult questions. And I am so proud of what we have achieved. ""My teammates, coaches, fellow competitors, and fans deserve 100% of me, but right now, it's best I leave the field of play to the next generation of dedicated and committed athletes."" With seven Super Bowl wins and a host of records held, Brady will go down as one of the greatest quarterbacks ever in the NFL.

Mane decides to leave Liverpool amid Bayern transfer links,"Sadio Mane is set to inform Liverpool of his desire to leave the club this summer,¬†GOAL¬†can confirm, with Bayern Munich leading the race to sign the Senegal star. The 30-year-old is understood to be ready for a new challenge having spent the last six years on Merseyside, and had hinted before the Champions League final that an announcement on his future was imminent. Mane did not, as promised, speak to the media after Liverpool‚Äôs 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in Paris on Saturday night, but sources have told¬†GOAL¬†that it is increasingly likely he will leave Anfield, and that Bayern are the prime candidates to sign him. Mane, as with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, is about to enter the final year of his contract with Liverpool, and negotiations over a new deal were shelved some time ago. The Reds have a good relationship with the player‚Äôs representative, Bjorn Bezemer, and had planned to hold talks at the end of the season over Mane‚Äôs future. However, growing reports of Bayern‚Äôs interest - and an apparent meeting between Bezemer and Hasan Salihamidzic, the German club‚Äôs sporting director, have not gone down well at Anfield.¬† Club sources are understood to be disappointed at the timing of such reports, coming as Liverpool were pursuing glory on multiple fronts. Mane‚Äôs form has been strong, but the speculation was viewed as an unwelcome distraction, with Jurgen Klopp issuing a thinly-veiled criticism of Bayern at his pre-Champions League final press conference. At this stage there has been no formal offer from the Bundesliga champions, and Liverpool sources insist that any fee for Mane would be well in excess of the ‚Ç¨30million (¬£25m/$32m) figure that has been widely quoted. Liverpool would also want to have a replacement lined up before selling, with Mane remaining a key figure in the team despite the January signing of Luis Diaz from Porto.¬† Mane scored 22 goals in all competitions this season, his form particularly strong following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations, where he had helped fire Senegal to glory in Cameroon. News of Mane‚Äôs likely exit will naturally concern fans, even if fears over Salah‚Äôs immediate future were assuaged last week when the Egyptian stated he would ‚Äúfor sure‚Äù be remaining with the club for another year. Mane‚Äôs impact since his move from Southampton in 2016 has been huge. He has scored 120 goals in 268 appearances for the Reds, playing in every position across the forward line and winning every major club honour available in that time. Liverpool have already begun building for the future with the capture of Diaz, who has made a fine start to life on Merseyside, but they would need to make another stellar signing if they were to plug the hole left by Mane‚Äôs exit.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-decides-to-leave-liverpool-amid-bayern-transfer-links/blt2c351608af7e6508,Neil Jones,1a1be19e-3365-4f75-b491-ca822095854a
PSG vs Lyon: A game about much more than the Women‚Äôs Champions League final,"When Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon meet in the second leg of their Women‚Äôs Champions League semi-final on Saturday night, it will be the 54th meeting between these two French rivals. However, despite the latter only coming out 3-2 winners in last week‚Äôs very competitive first leg, for a long time, they were not rivals. Indeed, it took PSG 22 attempts to beat Lyon, first doing so back in 2014 and, even since then, they‚Äôve only emerged victorious a further seven times. That was understandable. Between 2007 and 2020, Lyon would win 14 successive league titles, a record total in itself. The club also hold the record for most Coupe de France wins, with nine, five of those successive, and the most Women‚Äôs Champions League trophies, with seven ‚Äì again, five of them successive. Lyon created a dynasty in women‚Äôs football, the kind that will never be replicated and have long set the bar for how a club should treat its female athletes. But last season, PSG made a statement of their own. The Parisians snapped Lyon‚Äôs title-winning streak and picked up a first Division 1 Feminine title. Not only that ‚Äì PSG knocked Lyon out of the Champions League for the first time in seven years. La Dame de Fer et nos #CHAMPIONNES ! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôVous aimez ? ‚ú®üì∏ Julien Scussel pic.twitter.com/9ZIRVNLI5D ‚ÄúI have to say, I was sick of always losing in this kind of scenario here,‚Äù said PSG midfielder Grace Geyoro afterwards. It was her strike that sent the club into the semi-finals of the competition. There, she and her team would lose to eventual champions Barcelona on away goals, but it was a monumental season nonetheless; a first league title, the purging of some demons in this rivalry and a statement that PSG had what it takes to be a serious threat. Meanwhile, around 300 miles south of Paris, things weren‚Äôt so rosy. It would be Lyon‚Äôs first trophyless season in 16 years and changes would be made to ensure that didn‚Äôt happen again, most notably in the recruitment of Sonia Bompastor, who won 11 trophies with the club as a player, as head coach. Boosted by the return of Ada Hegerberg, too, those changes have worked. Lyon are well on track to take back their league title and look like their old selves again. Now, the problems are with PSG. A crazy situation earlier this season saw Kheira Hamraoui beaten with iron bars by masked men and sidelined for a spell as a result.  Later that month, Hayet Abidal, wife of former Barcelona and France defender Eric, announced she was filing for divorce after he admitted to an affair with Hamraoui, following links between the pair on the PSG midfielder‚Äôs phone were discovered by investigators. She has again made headlines this month after an altercation with team-mate Sandy Baltimore in training the day before the first leg of the UWCL semi-final. Hamraoui didn‚Äôt play last weekend, and she will not this weekend either. ‚ÄúIn difficult moments, the team has always found the resources to go for qualification,‚Äù head coach Didier Olle-Nicolle said on Friday, echoing words Geyoro had said to L‚ÄôEquipe last week: ‚ÄúWe can hate each other outside but, on the field, we have to manage to win.‚Äù Those aren‚Äôt PSG‚Äôs only issues. Contracts are expiring for some important players, most notably star striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto. Last year, the club lost a number of stars despite lifting the league title ‚Äì Irene Paredes joined Barcelona, while Christiane Endler, Perle Morroni and Signe Bruun all signed for Lyon. It‚Äôs a path that has been well-trodden over the years. For those players to still sign for Lyon after such a successful year with PSG was a suggestion that the power in France is still firmly held by its most illustrious club ‚Äì but for the latter, to be the best club in France is not enough. The seven-time European champions crave success bigger than that and are desperate to reclaim their status as the continent‚Äôs best. With so much talk of how great Barcelona, the reigning champions, are and suggestions from some that they could create a legacy like Lyon‚Äôs, it‚Äôs no wonder Europe‚Äôs long-standing powerhouse feels a little aggrieved. ""There was women's football before Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand it was played here for years,‚Äù Hegerberg told L‚ÄôEquipe earlier this month. ‚ÄúWe have to win again to regain our place in world football. We have the chance to do it this season. We have never lost against Barcelona."" To face the Catalan side in the showpiece event, though, Lyon first have to dismiss a familiar face. Despite the momentum in France swinging massively away from PSG this season, and the defensive horror show from the team in the first leg, they go into Saturday‚Äôs game with a huge chance to progress. At home, in front of what is anticipated to be a record crowd for a women‚Äôs domestic match in France, if not a sell-out, they trail by just one goal. The league title and the power might not be with PSG, but to prevent Lyon from reaching the final of the competition they have made their own would be the perfect way to hurt them. After a much-improved year, it would be a devastating result for Lyon. ""We have a lot of qualities in our team,"" Bompastor said on Friday. ""We are ready. We have the qualities to beat this Paris team. ""We have goals in our season and [Saturday's] game is one of the most important games. We hope to have a more important one with the final.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-lyon-about-more-than-women-champions-league-final/blt9a485e735b93c0f9,Ame√© Ruszkai,eb98a202-e5a4-4ed3-8eb5-28f8d65247af
Balotelli on Italy's World Cup play-off failure: I'm pretty good in front of goal,"Ex-Italy star Mario Balotelli feels that he could have scored the goals that would have stopped the Azzurri from crashing out of World Cup qualifying.  Italy racked up no fewer than 32 shots during their play-off against North Macedonia, but not one of them made it past goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski.  And at the other end Aleksandar Trajkovski swooped with one of his nation's few attempts on goal in injury time to secure a famous victory.  ""I'm always missed when we lose,"" Balotelli, who is currently playing for Adana Demirspor in Turkey, explained to Sky Sport Italia when asked for his thoughts on Italy's elimination. ""It's easy to say it now but before the match no one thought about me. ""I watched the match and there were opportunities. In front of goal I'm pretty good - and I'm not saying we would have won if I had been playing, but there were opportunities to score.""  Qatar 2022 will thus be the second consecutive World Cup for which Italy is absent, an unprecedented run for the four-time champions.  Coach Roberto Mancini is now under pressure in spite of winning Euro 2020 less than a year ago; but his former Inter and Manchester City charge believes he is still the right man for the job. ""I haven't spoken to him, but I have a great relationship with the manager and am so happy he is staying, especially as, in just a few years as manager, he is already a European champion,"" Balotelli added.

Man Utd agree to send Alex Telles on loan to Sevilla after Malacia transfer,"Manchester United left-back Alex Telles is close to signing for Sevilla on a season-long loan, GOAL can confirm. The 29-year-old arrived at Old Trafford back in October 2020 and found himself firmly behind Luke Shaw in the pecking order during his first season at the club.  Following Shaw's injury last campaign, Telles did enjoy slightly more first-team action, but the arrival of Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord this summer seemed set to change that moving forward.  Overall, the Brazilian has made exactly 50 appearances in all competitions for United across two seasons, and he will be hoping for more regular playing time in La Liga. As first reported by TNT Sport and confirmed by GOAL, Telles' move to Spain is close to being settled.  The defender is set to spend the season at Sevilla with a chance to prove his worth for a European contender. A medical has already been scheduled and the move could be announced as soon as Wednesday.  Telles will become Sevilla's second signing of the summer after centre-back Marcao joined from Galatasaray following the high-profile departures of Diego Carlos and Jules Kounde.  United have not been as active as they might have liked this summer with top target Frenkie de Jong seemingly no closer to signing.  Should they fail to land the Barcelona midfielder, the club could move for another midfielder, such as Leicester City's Youri Tielemans. Despite their struggles with De Jong, United have managed to recruit Lisandro Martinez, Christian Eriksen and the aforementioned Malacia, while also moving on fringe players such as Andreas Pereira, Dean Henderson and now Telles.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-agree-send-alex-telles-on-loan-sevilla-after-malacia/blt7047efa7a6fbadc9,Raisa Simplicio & Thiago Fernandes,ec1df9ef-1a67-4575-947c-2d81a22dd2cb
When was the last time Manchester United were relegated?,"Manchester United are by far the most successful club of the Premier League era, having won 13 league titles since 1992. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, the club never finished below third place and in the legendary Scot's final season at Old Trafford, United were crowned champions. The Red Devils have not won a league title since. They appear to be a long way off that pace again in the present, as Erik ten Hag's reign gets off to a disastrous start, and back-to-back defeats to open the 2022-23 campaign left a heavyweight outfit propping up the English top-flight table. Talk of relegation may be premature, but struggles for form do beg the question: when was the last time United suffered the ignominy of dropping down a division? GOAL is on hand to provide the answer... The Red Devils' most recent relegation came in the 1973-74 season when they finished in 21st place, with just 32 points to their name. The Red Devils lost 20 games that season, including their opening fixture 3-0 to Arsenal and their final game of the campaign 1-0 to Stoke City. The lowest United have finished in the Premier League is seventh during the 2013-14 season under David Moyes, the season immediately after Ferguson‚Äôs departure. As a result of their poor league performance, the Red Devils also failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time since the 1989-90 season. Erik ten Hag is the first Manchester United manager to lose his opening two league games in 20 years üòµ pic.twitter.com/hYJ62ixVm6 Their worst Premier League points return was posted in the 2021-22 campaign, with just 58 collected across 38 games. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a 1999 Treble-winning hero from his playing days, was dismissed midway through that season, with Ralf Rangnick failing to deliver an upturn in fortune following his appointment on an interim basis. While United have been finding the going tough of late, they have experienced far worse in their history. They have been relegated five times since their formation as a club in 1878, including one time under their original name, Newton Heath LYR F.C. Season League 1893-94 First Division 1921-22 First Division 1930-31 First Division 1936-37 First Division 1973-74 Division One Before the formation of the Premier League, Manchester United spent most of their time in the First Division - the former name of the top-flight in English football. After spending just one season in the Second Division, Manchester United were promoted back to the big time in 1975 as champions. Manchester United have been relegated on four other occasions prior to the 1970s: 1894, 1922, 1931 and 1937. They have never played lower than the second tier of English football, although they needed a win over Millwall on the final day of the season in 1934 to avoid relegation. United duly beat the London club 2-0 and leapfrogged the Lions in the table to relegate them instead. United are part of an elite group of six to have played every Premier League season since its founding in 1992, alongside Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool and Tottenham.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/when-was-the-last-time-manchester-united-were-relegated/ui28qgyq6irc12wv78pat3f6f,Chris Burton,5de4aa13-8289-415b-9cfd-e49514ce58cc

'Man Utd are struggling' ‚Äì Lack of transfer movement costing Ten Hag precious time in Red Devils rebuild,"Manchester United are ‚Äústruggling to get business done‚Äù in the summer transfer window, claims Gary Neville, with the Red Devils warned that a lack of movement on the recruitment front is costing new boss Erik ten Hag precious time. Plenty of movement was predicted at Old Trafford as a Dutch tactician takes the reins and an underperforming squad is overhauled, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Nemanja Matic having been allowed to leave as free agents. There have been no new arrivals outside of the dugout, though, and Neville fears that ‚Äì with Liverpool and Manchester City getting big-money deals for Darwin Nunez and Erling Haaland pushed through ‚Äì United are in danger of being left further behind by rivals that they already trail. Neville has said on Twitter as little substance is found to the endless rounds of rumours at Old Trafford: ‚ÄúI know early in the window but it‚Äôs worrying that United are struggling to get business done. ‚ÄúThe others seem set and ready yet United can‚Äôt get moving. ‚ÄúETH [Ten Hag] needs his group together asap to mould them.

While no fresh faces have been welcomed into the arrivals lounge at Old Trafford, there is plenty of speculation to be found regarding potential new recruits. Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong has emerged as a top target for United ‚Äì as a player that Ten Hag knows well from his time at Ajax ‚Äì but no agreement is in place for a Netherlands international that GOAL has learned could be prised from Camp Nou for around ‚Ç¨60 million (¬£51m/$62m). Another creative talent with ties to Ajax that the Red Devils continue to be linked with is Brazil international Antony, with the 22-year-old winger considered to be ready for a move away from the Eredivisie. Christian Eriksen could also be drafted in to help carry a playmaking burden, with the Danish midfielder available as a free agent after reaching the end of a short-term contract at Brentford. Going back to Ajax, and Jurrien Timber is considered to be a potentially shrewd addition for the Red Devils at centre-half ‚Äì while he can also fill in at right-back. Villarreal defender Pau Torres also continues to generate talk of interest from Manchester, as does West Ham holding midfielder Declan Rice, while Inter right-back Denzel Dumfries may be lined up to join fellow Dutchman Ten Hag in the Premier League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-struggling-transfer-movement-costing-ten-hag-red/bltc5a6bb5b76eac3ff,Chris Burton,2d6c6d1a-259e-45d7-a7ae-58f2f7952949
Rangnick unsure of Ronaldo & Cavani return date after forward were ruled out of Man Utd's derby clash with Man City,"Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani's injury-related absences could run longer than this weekend, Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick confirmed after his side's 4-1 derby loss to Manchester City. United made the short trip to Etihad Stadium to take on their noisy neighbours on Sunday and finished the day 22 points off the league leaders as Riyad Mahrez ran rampant and Harry Maguire suffered another misfire. Having needed a victory to stay near the front of the hunt for the top four and a Champions League berth, the Red Devils' loss was one of their toughest of the season, with them sorely missing the potential input of their veteran strikers up front. GOAL confirmed before the game that Ronaldo has picked up a knock and would not be included in Rangnick's matchday squad. Cavani, who has been out of action due to a groin complaint over the last few weeks and is still not back to full fitness, was also expected to be absent. But now their manager has revealed that the two could be set for lengthier lay-offs ahead of crucial fixtures in both the Premier League and Champions League with Tottenham and Atletico Madrid. Cristiano Ronaldo is injured and will miss the Manchester derby. pic.twitter.com/jGons1gGPo Shortly before kickoff, Rangnick had confirmed the absences of the club's two top strikers. ""Edi trained well in the last three days but in the end he didn‚Äôt feel quite well enough to play,"" he told MUTV, ""and Cristiano had some problems with his hip flexor on Friday."" Post-match, the German added that he was unsure on a potential return date, stating; ""I don't know. I was hoping to have them available for this game. We have two important games coming up against Spurs and Atletico and we have to put our full focus on that.

Chelsea takeover: Who is on the preferred bidders shortlist & what happens next?,"Chelsea Football Club¬†is set to change hands in 2022 for the first time since 2003, with Roman Abramovich preparing to bring 19 years as Blues owner to a close after seeing¬†sanctions imposed on him by the UK government. Various takeover contenders¬†were quick to throw their respective hats into the ring once it became apparent that the sale of the Premier League heavyweights was on the cards, with four final offers from different billionaire consortiums to be on the table by April 14.¬† The process of whittling that list of interested parties down to a select group of preferred bidders is now well under way, with¬†GOAL¬†telling you all you need to know about the four bidders. It was revealed on March 25 that consortiums that Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner¬†Todd Boehly¬†had been selected by¬†Raine Group¬†-¬†the US bank handling the sale of Chelsea - to¬†progress to the next stage.¬† Initially, Bohely's consortium was seen as part of a group of investors that includes Swiss billionaire¬†Hansjorg Wyss¬†and British entrepreneur¬†Jonathan Goldstein.¬†Subsequently, Mark Walter, who is another US-billionaire and long time associate of Boehly's joined the bid early this week. Furthermore, it has since been revealed on the day of the final bids that¬†Clearlake Capital's share will be a full 50 percent, but Boehly remains the face and operational leader of the group, despite his minority share.¬† Boehly has been the one attending matches and involved in the meetings with various stakeholders around the club this week.¬† They've appointed prominent Chelsea supporters Daniel Finkelstein, who is a Conservative Member of the House of Lords, and Barbara Charone, who is a well-known PR guru, as advisors.¬† Boehly had a ¬£2.2 billion bid to buy Chelsea in 2019 rejected by Roman Abramovich and has already done his due dilligence on the club.¬† He holds a percentage in US winning franchises the LA Dodgers and the LA Lakers. They are already in talks to revive Abramovich's abandoned project of Stamford Bridge and in talks to use the former project director David Hickey and architect Janet Marie Smith has also been consulted. The Ricketts Family Investment Group¬†are led by both¬†Tom and Laura Ricketts¬†who own the historic baseball team Chicago Cubs.¬† Tom is arguably the best connected to the Blues amongst all the bidders having previously met Abramovich after trying to buy the club in 2018. They have also got connections to Raine having done business with them in the past.¬† However, they have faced criticism based in part due to leaked emails from their father Joe which contained Islamophobic language.¬† They have moved to reassure supporters that those views don't reflect their own in meetings in and around London this week. Indeed, Laura Ricketts is a world leader in LGBTQ+ rights and has ambitious plans to further the remit of the Chelsea Foundation which is the charitable arm of the Blues.¬† They have significant backing from Citadel (a US hedge fund) founder¬†Ken Griffin¬†and¬†Dan Gilbert¬†of Rock Entertainment Group, who own a host of sports teams including the NBA franchise Cleveland Cavalliers. They both rank among the wealthiest people in America.¬† With several experienced sports administrators amongst them, the Ricketts bid also have experience developing in a stadium in an urban area. They modernised the Wrigley Field stadium in Chicago after taking over the Cubs.¬† They've promised to be 'champions on and off the field' in their most recent statement.¬† Little was known about Atalanta co-owner¬†Stephen Pagliuca¬†and his bid to buy Chelsea until this week.¬† The US-billionaire, who is also the co-owner of the Boston Celtics and is the co-chairman of Bain Capital, has finally revealed details of his bid late in the process.¬† ¬†They were boosted by the announcement that highly respected Canadian sports leader¬†Larry Tanenbaum¬†became the co-managing partner of their proposal.¬† Tanenbaum is one of the most influential figures in US sports co-owning multiple Toronto-based professional sports teams in the NHL, NBA, MLS, and CFL. He is also co-chairing Toronto's bid to host World Cup matches in 2026. He is also the founder of Kilmer Group which has experience in international construction and could help develop Stamford Bridge.¬† Alongside the two leads, former Disney CEO Bob Iger and Facebook co-Founder Eduardo Saverin rank among eight other names backing their approach.¬† The John Terry-led True Blues Consortium believe Pagliuca's bid is the best: ""Having engaged and being well received by all the bidders we were recently able to spend some time with Steve and Larry and getting to know their bid we're again confident that they are aligned with Chelsea fans, and of course have experience in this area of owning sports teams."" However, they are willing to work with another party should the Pagliuca-Tanenbaum bid not be chosen.¬† It is thought that Pagliuca will aim to keep his stake in Atalanta despite wanting to run the west Londoners. Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) release a statement with other supporters groups about the ownership, reiterating their demands. Interestingly, three of the four bidders praised for engaging significantly (Ricketts, Boehly & Broughton), requesting more dialogue from Pagliuca. pic.twitter.com/oHOTb26Lpl Ex-Liverpool chairman¬†Sir Martin Broughton's efforts to buy Chelsea was one of the first to be announced.¬† Alongside him is Conservative Member of Parliament and former Olympic chief¬†Lord Sebastian Coe¬†adding political clout. Wall Street investment banker Michael Klein, adding that financial clout.¬† Those two may be the leads of the bid but the majority of the backing is coming from¬†Josh Harris and David Blitzer¬†who are world leading sports administrators with stakes in clubs across Europe and Real Salt Lake City in MLS.¬† However, they own 18 percent in Crystal Palace which could represent a problem with the Premier League running due diligence alongside the bidding process.¬† They are said to have support from Creative Artists Agency (CAA), who are one of the biggest players in football talent management, and Evolution Media Capital, a sports advisory and financing partnership.¬† According to Sky News, there's backing from Vivek Ranadive, the owner of the perennially struggling NBA basketball team Sacramento Kings. There's no known plans to develop the stadium but in early statements to the UK newspapers, they promised significant funds and fan involvement.¬† With Roman Abramovich sanctioned, the Chelsea board - which includes the oligarch's associates like Marina Granovskaia, Bruce Buck, Eugene Tenenbaum - have been tasked with picking a new owner.¬† Raine Group are advising the process with the UK Government said to be staying out of any decision making, with their main aim to ensure that Abramovich doesn't profit from the sale while sanctioned.¬† When it comes to timelines, there is a hope that some indication on a preferred offer as early as next week. There's a harder deadline of 31 May when the club's operating licence expires. However, that doesn't mean the exchange will be imminent with a¬†due diligence process ongoing on behalf of both Chelsea FC and the Premier League.¬† All the four options are thought to be paying in cash and have promised a structured ¬£1bn spend upon winning any bid. The sale is expected to exceed the ¬£2.5bn ($3.3bn) Joseph Tsai paid for the Brooklyn Nets, making it the most expensive sports team transaction in history.¬† The money will go into either a charity or a frozen bank account, which means it could ultimately be claimed by Abramovich when the sanctions end.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-takeover-shortlist-preferred-bidder-stage-what/blt3b6feeb315707b45,Chris Burton,ab9df36b-c8d2-444e-b715-1c1dcf4201dd

For his contributions against Lampard‚Äôs side, Olise recorded two shots, one key pass and two dribbles, while he was fouled on five occasions. In addition, he accounted for five crosses, 22 passes and a passing accuracy of 68.2 percent.

Iwobi could only muster nine touches, one cross, six passes and a 100 percent passing accuracy.

"Nottingham Forest vs Sheffield United: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Nottingham Forest have the edge over Sheffield United in the battle for a Championship play-off final place heading into their semi-final second-leg clash on Tuesday. Forest secured a 2-1 win in Sheffield in the previous fixture and will be looking to capitalise on home advantage when they meet this week, with Huddersfield awaiting the winners in the final. At 6/5 (2.2) with bet365 to claim victory, Nottingham Forest are slight favourites to win the second leg of the tie. Sheffield United can be backed at 12/5 (3.4) and the draw is set at 23/10 (3.3). Nottingham Forest stars Dale Taylor and Sam Surridge are both priced at 11/2 (6.5) to score the first goal of the game, while team-mate Keinan Davis is 6/1 (7.0). Billy Sharp of Sheffield United is 7/1 (8.0) to break the deadlock, but he may be out of action. Team-mate William Osula is also available at 7/1 (8.0). Sheffield United were on a four-game unbeaten run in the Championship before they were beaten in the first leg. The visitors have some significant injury troubles to contend with heading into the crucial clash. David McGoldrick, Rhian Brewster, Jack O'Connell, Charlie Goode, Jayden Bogle, Billy Sharp and Oliver McBurnie are all expected to miss the clash. Forest, meanwhile, have now lost just one of their last seven - winning five games in that spell. Max Lowe and Lewis Grabban are both unavailable for the home team. Sheffield United have scored in each of their last six matches, while Forest have found the net in five of their last six, so backing both teams to score at 5/6 (1.83) may be a smart bet.

Djed Spence - The Manchester United-linked star compared to Alexander-Arnold and eyeing Liverpool upset,"Trent Alexander-Arnold may be out, but there will still be a swashbuckling right-back on display at the City Ground this weekend. Nottingham Forest fans wouldn‚Äôt swap Djed Spence for anyone right now, and no wonder.  The 21-year-old, on loan from Middlesbrough, has been attracting the attention of a host of top clubs with his performances in the Championship and, on Sunday, he will get the chance to test himself on the big stage, as Forest take on Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Spence has already made his mark against Premier League opposition this season.  Both Arsenal and Leicester found the Londoner too hot to handle ‚Äì Gabriel Martinelli named him as his toughest opponent of the season ‚Äì and he warmed up for Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side by scoring Forest‚Äôs first goal, a 25-yard screamer, in their 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night. His fan club is growing by the week. Bayern Munich are among those to have expressed an interest, while Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United have all received glowing reports.  Middlesbrough expect to sell this summer with Spence, whose contract expires in 2024, already valued at more than ¬£15 million ($20m). Some, indeed, believe that to be a conservative estimate.  ‚ÄúHe could get sold for ¬£25m ($33m),‚Äù said Jonathan Woodgate, Spence‚Äôs former boss at Boro, after that eye-catching display against Leicester last month. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs that good.‚Äù Ian Wright would certainly agree. The Arsenal legend was so impressed by Spence‚Äôs performance against the Gunners in January that he sought him out afterwards to offer some advice and encouragement. ""I said 'Listen, my friend, you're on loan from Middlesbrough and I don't know what's happened there, because if you can't get into the Middlesbrough side, I don't know what's wrong, so I need to know the full story,'"" Wright revealed. ""But let me say, that was one of the best right-back performances I have seen for a very long time.‚Äù He added: ""If we are talking about right-backs performing at an unbelievable level, we're talking about Reece James and Trent, but I have not seen a combative, technical, swashbuckling performance like that for a very long time.¬† ""I said to him, in all seriousness, 'That level we saw there? You should be in the Premier League.' Simple as that."" Born in London to Jamaican parents, Spence was first spotted playing for Junior Elite, the Beckenham-based grassroots club which helped launch the careers of Wilfried Zaha, Victor Moses, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Emile Smith Rowe, among others.¬† Smith Rowe, indeed, is a former team-mate but while he would move to Arsenal, Spence would join Fulham, leaving for Middlesbrough shortly before his 18th birthday in 2018. It was Tony Pulis, the former Stoke and West Brom boss, who gave him his professional debut, but it was under first Woodgate, and later Neil Warnock, that he emerged as a regular at the Riverside Stadium. Woodgate loved him, but Warnock‚Äôs relationship with him was a little more complicated.  Spence, he said, had ‚Äúall the tools‚Äù, but he questioned his mentality and dedication. He let him join Forest on loan, he said, because ‚Äúhe needed to sort himself out"". ‚ÄúHe could be playing at a top club in England or in non-league in five years,‚Äù Warnock added. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know which one.‚Äù We have a better idea now, that‚Äôs for sure. Spence has flourished at Forest, where his role as a wing-back accentuates his physical and technical gifts.¬† ‚ÄúI think Steve Cooper is the manager for him, to be honest,‚Äù says Warnock. ‚ÄúHe has let him go forward more often, which suits his game.‚Äù Cooper, a former U18s coach at Liverpool, is certainly a fan. ""I am very fond of him,"" he told The Athletic recently. ‚ÄúHe is a sensible lad and you can tell that he cares a lot about the next game, about Forest ‚Äì he loves Forest. You can see it in the way he plays. ‚ÄúHe is laid-back. That is probably the right description of him. But when you get engaged in a conversation with him, he is a thoughtful character. ""We love having him and our job is to keep trying to get the best out of him.‚Äù On Friday, Spence earned his first call-up to the England U21 squad, reward for his consistent, and eye-catching Forest performances. There, he will meet up with the likes of Harvey Elliott and Curtis Jones, and on Sunday he will be able to introduce himself personally. Liverpool, of course, arrive as favourites, and with an unprecedented ‚Äòquadruple‚Äô in their sights, but Forest will relish the chance to get stuck into their famous visitors.

How Argentina went from 'mistrust' to blind faith in manager Scaloni after Copa America,"Argentina national team players have developed complete faith in head coach Lionel Scaloni after overcoming their initial mistrust, midfielder Rodrigo De Paul says. Scaloni was appointed Argentina boss in 2018, taking on his first senior head coach role. The 44-year-old guided the Albiceleste to the Copa America title in 2021, beating Brazil 1-0 in the final, and they subsequently booked their spot in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. De Paul highlighted the Copa America success as the turning point in the relationship between Argentina and the players, as there was some scepticism ahead of the tournament due to their World Cup qualifying draws against Colombia and Chile. ""At first there was mistrust. With us, with the coaching staff, it was quite difficult. Before the Copa America we had two qualifying matches and we tied them,"" he told Telefe. ""Before the Copa America started we would go to dinner and turn off the TV, we got to that point because it was quite difficult, it felt like there were people out there who wanted the national team to fail. ""Now Scaloni could convince us of anything. Obviously, one is convinced when things [like the Copa America] happen. ""He is very detailed and, because of how he prepares matches and tactical work, everything ends up happening. If it's 10 in the morning and he says 'good night', then it's night for us."" Argentina picked up another impressive victory when they beat Estonia 5-0 in a friendly last week. The South American nation have not tasted defeat under Scaloni since they lost to Brazil in the 2019 Copa America semi-finals. Since then, they have gone 33 games without a loss. Argentina have lost just four times since Scaloni took charge, winning 31 of the 47 matches they have played under the former Lazio and Atalanta player.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-argentina-went-from-mistrust-to-blind-faith-in-manager/blt75f163b6e788f763,Peter McVitie,652fc1b8-91eb-45e6-bcca-ccf6ad4dff13
Courtois gets ‚Äòbrick wall‚Äô tattoo to honour Real Madrid‚Äôs Champions League win over Liverpool,"Thibaut Courtois has unveiled a new tattoo of a brick wall on his arm, to honour his goalkeeping heroics for Real Madrid in their Champions League Final triumph over Liverpool. The Belgian turned in a stunning performance in goal as Los Blancos edged the Reds in Paris to end their four-year wait to be crowned kings of Europe once more. Having sometimes come under fire for his performances since his arrival from Chelsea, it marked one of the finest games of the shot-stopper's career - and now he has further celebrated his performance with a spot of ink. Taking to Instagram, Courtois showcased his new piece, revealing a funky, stylised design of a brick wall, overlaid with his initials and shirt number. The piece represents his clean sheet during the match at Stade de France, as he saw off a flurry of dramatic Liverpool chances in calm and composed fashion. His efforts earned him the Man of the Match accolade - making him the first goalkeeper to win the prize in the Champions League Final since Edwin van der Sar for Manchester United in 2008.

But it will be fair to say that it is his most recent campaign that has helped cement his reputation at Santiago Bernabeu, after Madrid previously faltered in Europe under his watch and their top-flight hold was broken by rivals Atletico Madrid. Now, he is arguably the undisputed number one shot-stopper in Europe again - and will be central to the Blancos' hopes of a successful defence across multiple fronts this coming season.

"Sevilla vs Barcelona: Predictions, tips & betting odds","Barcelona visit the Estadio Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday evening to face Sevilla in what should be a fascinating La Liga encounter.  The side from Seville have made their worst start to a league season in 41 years taking just one point from their opening three matches and face a Barca team who have hit their stride with two successive high-scoring wins. Julen Lopetegui's men ended last season in poor fashion and their record is 2022 is extremely disappointing.  Sevilla have won just five of their last 21 league matches, while against Barca they have failed to win any of their last 13 clashes in La Liga.  The hosts are priced at 7/2 (4.50) with bet365, while Barca can be backed at 4/5 (1.80) and the draw is offered at 13/5 (3.60).  Following a blank on his Barca debut, Robert Lewandowski has hit back-to-back braces and the Polish forward is offered at 3/1 (4.00) to break the deadlock, ahead of Ansu Fati and Memphis Depay who both can be backed at 13/2 (7.50).  The shortest priced player for Sevilla is Youssef En-Nesyri at 6/1 (7.00) although the Moroccan international forward is yet to score or start a game this season.  Spain striker Rafa Mir has been chosen to lead the line in the three matches so far and is priced at 17/2 (9.50).  This remains one of the biggest fixtures in Spanish football and could be the best way for Sevilla to snap out of their poor run.  The Andalusians always raise their game for the visit of Barca, and the stadium will be packed on Saturday night.  Nevertheless, this has been a tumultuous week off the pitch for Sevilla with a chaotic end to the transfer window not creating the best backdrop for the match.  Barcelona meanwhile are firing on all cylinders with Robert Lewandowski showing not only he is an exceptional goal scorer but also a superb footballer capable of effortlessly fitting into Barca's system of play.  The visitors are priced at 8/11 (1.73) to score over 1.5 goals and with both Osasuna and Almeria scoring twice against Sevilla, Barcelona will fancy their chances of scoring at least twice on Saturday. You can watch La Liga live on the go with your iPhone, iPad or Android device through your bet365 account. All you need is a funded account or to have placed a bet in the last 24 hours to qualify.

Arsenal star Miedema: I almost retired at 18 after World Cup heartbreak,"Vivianne Miedema has revealed that she came close to hanging up her boots as a teenager, with the Arsenal star stating the heartbreak of the Netherlands' 2015 World Cup exit almost convinced her to retire. The 25-year-old, then 18, was a part of the side that was knocked out by eventual runners-up Japan in the last 16. Now a European champion with the Oranje and a World Cup finalist herself, the Women's Super League star has opened up on how close she came to bowing out of the game at a young age. ""It was the toughest moment of my career,"" she said to MOTDx. ""I was really close to retiring. When I came home, I said I couldn't do it any more. I couldn't deal with the pressure. ""I didn't like football and I told my mum 'this is me done'. I was going to play for fun back in Holland."" As one of the bright lights of the WSL and the women's game at large, the Dutchwoman admits that her drive to play is borne out of a love for friendship - and that it is ""amazing"" she can be considered as a role model to young players. ""I started playing football because I wanted to be part of a team with my friends, I'm still the same now,"" she added. ""It is amazing to be seen as a role model and for young girls to say 'I want to be like Miedema' or 'I want to be like Fran Kirby'.

Kimpembe remains of interest to Chelsea as transfer questions are asked at PSG,"Presnel Kimpembe continues to see questions asked of his future at Paris Saint-Germain, with GOAL learning that the France international defender remains of interest to Chelsea. The 26-year-old centre-half is a product of PSG‚Äôs academy system and has taken in over 220 appearances for the reigning Ligue 1 champions. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has spoken of his desire to retain a Parisian core in a star-studded squad, but those words are not being echoed in current transfer business. As speculation rages around Kimpembe, PSG are reported to be one of the parties interested in Inter defender Milan Skriniar. They are also looking at Italy international Gianluca Scamacca, who has been impressing at Sassuolo, and Portuguese midfielder Renato Sanches ‚Äì with the former Golden Boy award winner restoring his reputation at Lille. A deal for Vitinha is also in the process of being pushed through, with the Portugal international set to arrive from Porto. A man with 28 senior international caps to his name has spoken of a desire to remain in his current surroundings, but is leaving exit doors ajar. Kimpembe has said when quizzed on his plans, with his current contract running through to 2024: ‚ÄúEveryone knows the love I have for PSG, I think it's mutual. ‚ÄúI am coming to a key moment in my career, my next contract will be very important. ‚ÄúI'm waiting to meet the new sports management to discuss the club's future project. I think we will have to discuss things fairly quickly.‚Äù With a proven performer having formed part of France‚Äôs victorious squad at the 2018 World Cup, it comes as no surprise to find that Kimpembe continues to attract admiring glances from across Europe. Manchester United and Juventus have seen moves mooted before, while Chelsea retain interest despite seeing advances rebuffed in the past. The Premier League outfit are very much in the market for defensive reinforcements after seeing Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen depart Stamford Bridge as free agents. Atletico Madrid are said to be another suitor, with Kimpembe‚Äôs representatives understood to have held talks with the Liga heavyweights.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kimpembe-interest-chelsea-transfer-questions-psg/blt75ae16739f230e34,Marc Mechenoua,911d3626-fc55-4082-a47a-c462be1f914e
Chelsea match Arsenal mark as Blues book FA Cup final clash with Liverpool,"Chelsea have made near-two-decade history after making the FA Cup final for the third time in consecutive seasons following a low-wattage 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Wembley Stadium. Second-half goals for former Eagles loanee Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount did the job for Thomas Tuchel's Blues, to set up a Carabao Cup final rematch with Liverpool next month at the national stadium once more. The London outfit will not only be determined to make up for their prior loss to the Reds but will allso hope to eradicate last season's hurt after falling short at the final hurdle. In defeating Palace, the Blues have now made it to the showpiece game of football's oldest competition three seasons on the bounce, having also done so in 2019-20 and 2020-21, becoming the first side since Arsenal to manage the feat, who achieved it between 2000-01 and 2002-03. Tuchel will need no reminder of last term's ultimate result, when his side were downed in an upset by Leicester City, though the pain of their loss likely helped drive them to the Champions League crown against Manchester City mere days later. Nor too will they have likely forgot the sting of defeat in 2020, when a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang double helped Arsenal claim a London derby victory at Wembley. 3 - @ChelseaFC are the first team to reach the men's FA Cup final in three consecutive seasons since Arsenal between 2000-01 and 2002-03.

It is only the second time in history that the same two sides will compete in the finals of both domestic cup competitions. 1992-93 - Chelsea and Liverpool will be just the second pair of teams to contest both the FA Cup and League Cup finals in the same season, after Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday in 1992-93.

Is Arsenal transfer the best move for Turner in USMNT goalkeeper battle?,"Shortly after the U.S. men's national team's win over El Salvador on Thursday, Gregg Berhalter confirmed American soccer's worst-kept secret. Matt Turner, fresh off keeping another clean sheet, is bound for Arsenal, the Premier League, and that proverbial next step. ""It's an amazing story,"" Berhalter said. ""His work ethic, his belief in himself and his never-give-up attitude, it's a great story and Matt is a great guy, a great team-mate. We're lucky to have him. ""Tonight was an example where he did everything he had to do. He was calm in all situations, wasn't tested much, but he was there when we needed him and he looked like a guy that's going to Arsenal for sure."" Berhalter's right: by any logic, Turner never should have made it this far. Just six short years ago, he wasn't deemed good enough to be selected as one of the 75 picks in the 2016 MLS SuperDraft. A product of Fairfield University, Turner's professional career only began as the result of a successful trial, one which saw him eke his way onto an MLS roster. But now, Turner finds himself achieving the unthinkable. He's in the running to be the U.S. men's national team's top goalkeeper at this year's World Cup. And, after emerging as the best goalkeeper in MLS, he's set to sign with Arsenal. Matt Turner signing an Arsenal shirt last night after keeping a clean sheet for the US. Deal now agreed between Arsenal and New England, which will see him join in the summer rather than now. pic.twitter.com/6vRDBEO6QW But there is one big question: is this the right move at the right time for a player that is still pushing to be the USMNT's World Cup starter? As Turner looks ahead towards his move to London this summer, he does so with one eye also fixed on the World Cup this winter. Turner, as things stand, finds himself in the midst of a goalkeeper battle with another goalkeeper that calls the Premier League his home. Although USMNT boss Gregg Berhalter has never said it, Zack Steffen has largely been the USMNT's No. 1 goalkeeper when healthy. He's had that role for some time, and it wasn't until Turner shined this past summer at the Gold Cup that there was any doubt over Steffen's status as first-choice. Talent-wise, Steffen has long been at a top, top level, which is one of the reasons that Manchester City signed him in the first place. He's an athletic player, comfortable with his feet and has fantastic reflexes and instincts.At City, he's learned under Ederson, one of the best goalkeepers in the world today, while getting occasional time in cup games. There are worse places to be than playing under Pep Guardiola, a manager that must have a goalkeeper capable of effectively playing as a sweeper. Berhalter, by and large, is the same. He likes goalkeepers that can play out of the back and, having managed Steffen with the Columbus Crew, trusts him to do just that. Steffen's talent and training environment have always been enough to overlook his relative lack of gametime because he's earned that trust. But now, Turner finds himself pushing Steffen for that spot. Over the last two years, Turner has emerged as the best goalkeeper in MLS, an elite shotstopper that rarely puts a foot wrong. While he's not as good with the ball at his feet as Steffen, he is arguably the better pure goalkeeper, with his record of four goals in 14 USMNT caps showing just how good he is. The argument that Turner has had over Steffen is form, with the soon-to-be former New England Revolution goalkeeper a constant for one of the best teams in the league. He helped lead the Revs to the Supporters' Shield last season and has been voted team MVP as well as an MLS All-Star. While Steffen has waited behind Ederson, Turner has taken his chance with the Revs, playing week in and week out and improving every step of the way. There's no experience like first-team experience, and those experiences have allowed Turner to rise from undrafted to USMNT regular. +3 for the Stars and Stripes. pic.twitter.com/Z0hkVm7lOw The question is if those experiences continue at Arsenal, as Turner could very well be sacrificing his edge in this competition to complete this dream move. As things stand, Arsenal have two regular first-team goalkeepers in Aaron Ramsdale and Bernd Leno, the latter of whom will almost certainly move on with Turner now coming in. However, at best, Turner will now find himself in another competition with Ramsdale, one which will be tough to win for a variety of reasons. The first is Ramsdale's form. The ¬£24 million ($32.6m) summer signing from Sheffield United has been a revelation since making the move to Arsenal, locking down their No. 1 spot ahead of Leno. Since assuming that role, Ramsdale has made several spectacular saves, earning a spot with England in the process. Unseating Ramsdale will be difficult for Turner, who is also four years older than his future teammate. And, with the World Cup looming, time will be against him when it comes to earning Mikel Arteta's trust. Without that starting role, Turner would need to find another way to distance himself from Steffen. That could be with his performances in the rest of World Cup qualifying, with Steffen missing games once again this window due to injury. And that's the risk Turner is taking, although it is obviously a calculated one. It's also a risk that comes with a massive pay raise and the fulfillment of a boyhood dream, which will always be a deciding factor when a club like Arsenal comes knocking. What the Gunners give Turner most of all is a chance. It gives him a chance to play at the highest level for an internationally-recognized club. It gives him a chance to prove to Berhalter and the rest of American soccer that he can be the No. 1 in Qatar this winter. And it gives him a chance to add another improbable chapter to a Cinderella story that somehow keeps becoming more unlikely by the day.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-transfer-turner-usmnt-goalkeeper-battle/blta6affecfde17fc4a,Ryan Tolmich,8fc1ab50-b101-426a-830c-e4a78d2af443
Mbappe to sign PSG contract extension and snub Real Madrid transfer,"Kylian Mbappe has decided to renew his contract with Paris Saint-Germain, GOAL can confirm, with the 23-year-old set to sign a three-year renewal. The forward's current deal expires at the end of the season and Real Madrid made an offer to sign him this summer. However, he has decided to continue at PSG for the time being and will pen a new contract. The striker's contract extension is expected to be announced in the wake of PSG's final Ligue 1 game of the season against Metz on Saturday evening. Mbappe's mother, Fayza Al-Amari, revealed this week that there would be no further negotiations as the France international had deals in place with both PSG and Real Madrid. Al-Amari said that there were no major differences between the contracts and that it would be up to the player to decide which club he would prefer to play for next season. Mbappe has had another excellent season for PSG. He is the Ligue 1 top scorer with 25 goals and tops the division's assist chart with 17. In all competitions, he has scored 36 goals in 45 matches. Despite his fine individual performances, the campaign has been underwhelming for the French giants. They wrapped up the Ligue 1 title, but it is their only piece of silverware this season as they were knocked out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage by Real Madrid and missed out on the Coupe de France.

History-making Son sends Premier League goal record warning to rivals as he prepares to renew Kane partnership at Spurs,"Son Heung-min has warned Premier League rivals that there will be no letting up in his devastating partnership with Tottenham team-mate Harry Kane as the pair seek to enhance a notable entry in the English top-flight record books. No other pairing has been as prolific in the modern era, with a piece of history once held by Chelsea duo Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard being re-written in the 2021-22 campaign. Son and Kane have now combined for a remarkable haul of 41 goals between them, putting them five efforts clear at the top of that list, but ‚Äúgreed‚Äù on the part of both men means that they will be looking to raise that bar even higher in the 2022-23 season. Spurs are set to open the new Premier League campaign at home to Southampton on August 6, with Son and Kane hoping to hit the ground running. A highly-rated South Korea international that claimed a share of the Golden Boot last season believes there is more to come from a deadly strike pairing, telling GQ Korea: ‚ÄúI saw Kane's interview where he said that he spends more time with me than his wife. That's really the fact though. I also spend more time on the field with Kane than I do with my parents at home. ‚ÄúWe are really close. We understand each other really well, and we also know how the other is off the pitch. Kane and I both know what the other likes. It's really special. ‚ÄúWe have already made 41 goals together. What Kane and I really have in common is that we both have a lot of greed and have the strong will to always improve. Even beyond football skills, our mindsets are similar. ‚ÄúI want to continue the record that I have set with a team-mate like this, although our record will be broken one day.

Man Utd have 22 shots but fail to score vs Watford as Foster becomes oldest goalkeeper to keep clean sheet at Old Trafford,"Former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster got the better of his old team on Saturday by keeping out the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and earning Watford a clean sheet at Old Trafford. Foster, 38, became the oldest visiting keeper to shut out United in the Premier League as the Red Devils endured a frustrating afternoon.  Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. racked up 22 shots over the 90 minutes but were ultimately forced to settle for a 0-0 draw against the relegation strugglers.  Foster's heroics The Watford man, who made 23 appearances for United during a five-year stay between 2005 and 2010, proved a thorn in their side on Saturday.  He made three crucial saves to keep them at bay, while Cristiano Ronaldo hit the post after just four minutes but failed to get his name on the scoresheet.  38 - Ben Foster (38y 329d) becomes the oldest visiting goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the Premier League. Indeed, the previous oldest visiting keeper to achieve this feat was David Seaman (38y 231d) for Arsenal in May 2002. Shutout. pic.twitter.com/fm5wGzfVZP The striker has endured a tough time in front of goal as of late.  Just one of his 15 goals since returning to United has come since the start of 2022, and he now has netted once in his last eight Premier League outings. Saturday's draw brought to an end a run of two consecutive Premier League victories for the Reds, although they remain unbeaten in the league since January 3.  Those dropped points, though, could prove costly in the race for Champions League qualification.  Fifth-placed Arsenal are two points behind the Red Devils but have played three games fewer, although they do not play this weekend due to Liverpool's involvement in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-have-22-shots-but-fail-to-score-vs-watford-as-foster/blta1e76e5ec6b1ff50,Daniel Edwards,13d8177a-98ee-4a76-8c43-2ae84cd09114

'They paid ‚Ç¨80m for Ozil!' - Arsenal TWICE refused to spend big on Higuain... and he's not happy about it,"Gonzalo Higuain is still unable to explain why a proposed transfer to Arsenal never happened, with the Argentine striker eager to point out that the Gunners splashed out ‚Ç¨80 million (¬£69m/$84m) on Mesut Ozil within days of deeming him to be too expensive. Arsene Wenger was famed for his frugal approach to recruitment throughout an iconic reign in north London, but he made the odd exception and was prepared to smash records when the right players became available. Prolific frontman Higuain was among those to register on his radar on a regular basis, but two opportunities to acquire the free-scoring South American were ultimately passed up. Wenger said of Higuain in the summer of 2013: ‚ÄúWe were working on two or three targets and he was one of them. It didn't come off in the end, that doesn't take anything away from his quality. ‚ÄúNapoli took advantage of that at the right moment, it's more about timing as well.‚Äù Higuain, who went on to hit 91 goals for Napoli across three seasons, has told TyC Sports of being passed over by the Gunners as they snapped up a German playmaker: ‚ÄúI remember that I was on the verge of going to Arsenal when I went to Napoli, but they said I was too expensive. ‚ÄúAnd a few days later, they paid ‚Ç¨80m for Ozil!‚Äù After opting against signing Higuain in 2013, despite him having hit over 100 goals at Real Madrid, Arsenal continued to monitor his progress in Italy. Another opportunity to lure him to England presented itself in 2016, with the Argentine having starred in Naples, but once again the Gunners were unable to put a deal in place and a proven performer ended up at Juventus. Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis said at the time: ‚ÄúI think we received some requests from Arsenal. Personally, I also received a request from Atletico Madrid. ‚ÄúBut they didn't put enough money on the table. We were not ready to sell him ‚Äì for me Higuain was not for sale.‚Äù Higuain did eventually arrive in the Premier League when joining Chelsea on loan in 2019. He won the Europa League while with the Blues, but had endured a dip in form by then and hit only five goals through 19 appearances and eventually left Europe to join David Beckham‚Äôs MLS expansion franchise at Inter Miami in 2020.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/80m-for-ozil-arsenal-snub-stuns-higuain-why-transfer-never/bltbdff1431eb1bdd08,Chris Burton,69dbf618-e94e-42d2-9d99-9ff82ba2bfde
Martin Tyler apologises following 'hooligan related' Hillsborough remark as BBC expresses 'regret',"The BBC has issued an apology for not challenging Martin Tyler when he appeared to refer to the Hillsborough disaster as a ""hooligan-related incident"".  The Sky Sports commentator made the controversial comments on the Radio 4 Today news programme on Friday morning, with Tyler later apologising for any ""misunderstanding"". In 1989, 97 Liverpool supporters were unlawfully killed while attending an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield due to police negligence. ""You've got to remember that football was in a bit of a crisis at that time. We weren't that long after Hillsborough and other hooligan-related issues as well. So it was very much a difficult time for the game generally,"" he said.  ""We regret that we did not robustly challenge Martin Tyler on a comment which appeared to link Hillsborough and hooliganism,"" a statement read.  ""Martin has since apologised for the comment and clarified that these were separate examples, and he did not intend to conflate the two."" GOAL's Liverpool correspondent Neil Jones gives his view on Tyler's comments When will people learn? When will people understand that their words have consequences, and that when discussing something which caused so much distress and pain, they should choose them far more carefully?  Martin Tyler is not the first person to do something like this, and sadly he won't be the last either, but for someone in his position, this really was a mistake that is hard to understand. He may not have meant it to come out as it sounded - which was pretty badly - but such carelessness is unforgivable, when talking about an issue such as this.  Hillsborough families have fought for more than three decades for the truth of that day, and its aftermath, to be heard.  The hurt and upset that has been caused in the meantime is incomprehensible, and to hear one of football's most famous commentators peddling one of the great lies of the story, on national radio, is unacceptable. If anyone should know better, it's him. ""This morning while discussing various crises facing football 30 years ago, I referred to some examples including the Hillsborough disaster and also controversy over hooliganism at matches,"" Tyler wrote. ""These are two separate issues. There is no connection at all between the Hillsborough disaster and hooliganism - I know that, and I was not implying that there was. I apologise sincerely and wholeheartedly for any misunderstanding.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bbc-martin-tyler-hillsborough-comments/blt6bfcb3357dddc03d,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,2c2b5026-af1e-4782-bb3c-0ee216dc5056
Messi's dancefloor 'murder': How Covid-19 mystery soured PSG star's Argentine Christmas,"Years of experience for opposing teams have taught us that it is near-impossible to stop Lionel Messi from running riot within the confines of the football pitch. Now, though, at least for a week or so, coronavirus has succeeded where so many hapless defenders has failed. The Paris Saint-Germain ace picked up the ‚Äús*itty virus‚Äù, as he more than aptly dubbed it in his New Year's message, while back in Argentina for the festive period, causing him to delay his return back to France and miss their opening games of 2022. It is common to ponder once that positive come back just where the infection may have sprung from, but in Messi's case, there are almost too many candidates to properly calculate ‚Äì as the star did not exactly spend the holidays isolated from human contact. He is far from alone. December in Argentina marks not just the holiday period but the start of summer, and in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Cordoba and every major city throughout the month, bars and restaurants were jammed with revellers, while families and friends in private homes gathered together for numerous barbecues and other festivities. Unsurprisingly, that party spirit, coupled with the arrival of Omicron, has led to a huge upturn in case numbers. From 1,881 at the start of last month, confirmed positives ballooned to a record 81,210 on Tuesday, while the positive testing rate is up above 50 per cent ‚Äì with some experts forecasting that the true rate of daily infection could be anywhere from 400,000 to 800,000. The impressive local vaccination rate means that fortunately those astronomical numbers have, as of yet, had limited effect on hospitalisations and deaths, which remain almost stable. But it is nevertheless a headache for thousands forced to miss work and other engagements after receiving the bad news, of which Messi is just one of many. One man who insists he is not responsible for giving Messi the illness is Fer Palacio, a local DJ who was pictured alongside the 34-year-old in all his fluorescent glory at an awards party organised by popular streamer Coscu. The internet personality himself gave warning that his lavish bash could be responsible for a spike in cases. ‚ÄúI was just told that two people who were in the event tested Covid positive,‚Äù Coscu wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúThe truth is that we were all hugging and kissing each other, so we are all close contacts.‚Äù Attention quickly turned to Palacio, with the DJ receiving abusive social media messages from irate Messi fans presumably outraged that their hero could be one of the millions who have suffered from the virus in the pandemic. ‚ÄúThey have gone as far as to call me 'murderer' in their messages, a lot of bad vibes,‚Äù Palacio fired, while maintaining his epidemiological innocence: ‚ÄúI went yesterday to get tested because I have to go to Uruguay and I do not have Covid.‚Äù In another surreal twist, the DJ was followed by Los Palmeras in brandishing their negative test results. The seminal Santa Fe cumbia band, who alongside Messi were guests of honour and the muscial entertainment at the show, certainly come under the umbrella of the at-risk population ‚Äì 2022 marks their 50th year together performing, while lead singer Ruben Deica is still going strong at the age of 69. Deica and his fellow band members serenaded the dancing Messi and wife Antonella Roccuzzo throughout the evening, and also posed for photos once their set was over. They too, though, managed to escape the clutches of the virus, with their latest Instagram post proudly showing off a negative test signed by the Santa Fe provincial government. Infection accusations aside, PSG would be forgiven for feeling just slightly exasperated with their summer signing. Messi's first six months at Parc des Princes, a few typically brilliant moments aside, fell short of sky-high expectations, hindered by teething problems with attacking partners Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, his late start due to Argentina's Copa America exploits and then repeated international call-ups throughout the first half of the season. He has featured in just 12 of PSG's 19 Ligue 1 games to date and netted a solitary league goal, an underwhelming record that admittedly has had little effect on their fortunes as Mauricio Pochettino's side sit 13 points clear of their nearest challengers. Messi will link up again with his employers in the coming days after reportedly returning a negative test on Tuesday, but it will now merely be a flying visit. At the end of January, Argentina will play two more World Cup qualifiers back in South America, and while qualification for Qatar is already safe, it is tough to see their captain turning down the opportunity to link up once more with the likes of Rodrigo de Paul, Emiliano Martinez and Nicolas Otamendi to hone the nation's strategy looking forward to the finals. PSG's fear now is that their No.30 could head into February's crunch Champions League tie with Real Madrid having played as few as three competitive games for the club in the last two months; or even worse, that he picks up a knock on international duty that would rule him out entirely for the last-16 clash. Having already bemoaned Messi's unavailability due to Argentina commitments in November, club sporting director Leonardo's spirits are, then, unlikely to be lifted with these latest developments. But if any player is capable of shaking off the bug and coming back better than ever, even with limited playing and training time, it is the little Rosario-born wizard, who will surely be raring to go ‚Äì not to mention refreshed after this unexpectedly prolonged break ‚Äì once he is cleared to return to action.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-dancefloor-murder-covid-psg-champions-league-headache/blt1d112b7b4811658f,Daniel Edwards,8146365b-f956-4120-a32a-6b150bfa8e74
Arsenal boss Arteta: Amazon documentary was 'challenging' experience for club,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta admitted that filming a documentary for Amazon took its toll on everyone involved with the Gunners. Part of the ""All or Nothing"" series, Arsenal's entire 2021-22 was captured on camera, with the first episodes soon to come out for public consumption.  Arteta, though, is yet to see the finished product and revealed that he was often uncomfortable with the intrusion into the club's day-to-day life. ""Honestly, it was challenging but as well I think it was an incredible experience personally, for the club and everybody can see the reality without any boundaries about how it works on a daily basis at the club,"" the manager told reporters. ""On a personal level obviously it was really demanding because you are on camera for 24/7. ""You tend to forget about it. So when they talk about Big Brother houses and people can do certain things, it is true because I have experience that you forget about the cameras.  ""Probably in the documentary you will see, that I don't think that now unfortunately. Now probably if we are going to have a camera there, I would not do it. But they are done."" ""Were we allowed to censor anything? [Director of Media] Mark [Gonnella] was. I haven't seen anything. I think I'm the only person at a senior level that hasn't seen it. ""[If there are issues] it will be my blame because I did it - or someone else did it!"" ""Arsenal: All or Nothing"" is due to air its first three episodes on August 4, with more becoming available in the following weeks on Amazon Prime.  The series will include a total of eight episodes, following the Gunners throughout what was ultimately a disappointing campaign as Arteta's men just missed out on Champions League football.

Man Utd won't give up on De Jong as Ten Hag targets five summer transfers,"Manchester United are preparing for a drawn-out pursuit of Frenkie de Jong this summer and haven't given up on taking him to Old Trafford. The Barcelona midfielder is a leading target for new manager Erik ten Hag, who is aiming to make five signings in his first transfer window at the club. De Jong is strongly-admired within the club ‚Äì and has been watched extensively during his time at Ajax and Barca. Ten Hag sees De Jong as part of a midfield overhaul following the departure of Paul Pogba. But De Jong, who worked with his¬†fellow Dutchman at Ajax, will need to be convinced before he commits to a move to Old Trafford, with sources claiming ""stars will have to align"" to get the deal done. Barcelona are willing to accept ‚Ç¨60m for Man Utd-linked Frenkie De Jong üí∞ pic.twitter.com/D9GszNbpvb As reported by GOAL, Barca are prepared to listen to offers around the ‚Ç¨60 million (¬£51m/$63m) mark. But the main stumbling block appears to be the player‚Äôs willingness to leave after three years at Camp Nou. Ten Hag knows he needs at least one new central midfielder this summer, with Nemanja Matic also set to depart. Ten Hag and Football Director John Murtough discussed targets during a transfer summit in Amsterdam last month. Along with De Jong, Leeds‚Äô Kalvin Phillips is another player admired, while Declan Rice is of long-term interest. United are, however, unwilling to meet West Ham‚Äôs ¬£150m ($188m) valuation - and sources close to the England international do not anticipate an approach from Old Trafford at that price. Meanwhile, United are conscious of being used as leverage in N‚ÄôGolo Kante‚Äôs contract negotiations at Chelsea. They are long-term admirers of the France international and have been linked with a move in recent weeks. Kante fits the profile of the style of player Ten Hag wants ‚Äì but the 31-year-old‚Äôs age and injury record would be concerns. He is entering the final year of his contract at Chelsea and is due for negotiations over a new deal. Claimed interest from United could therefore be used as a bargaining tool. In what is a vital summer, Ten Hag does not want to be distracted in his planned overhaul and believes all areas of the squad are in need of addressing.

Ayunga: Kenya forward agrees two-year deal with St Mirren - reports,"Kenya forward Jonah Ayunga has reportedly agreed to sign for Scottish Premiership side St Mirren. Currently at English League One side Morecambe ‚Äì where he has spent a season ‚Äì Ayunga will move when the transfer window opens after agreeing a two-year deal. ""We‚Äôve got four players signed, which we‚Äôll announce over the coming weeks,"" Stephen Robinson, St Mirren boss, told Renfrewshire Live Sport, as quoted by the Scottish Daily Express. ""All four will strengthen the squad and enhance what we‚Äôve already got. ""I believe we need a couple more, maybe three, so there‚Äôs still more business to be done. Especially when the market opens up in England."" Ayunga is expected to be Robinson‚Äôs fourth signing of the summer. The manager signed the 24-year-old- from Bristol Rovers last year while he was in charge of Morecambe. St Mirren decided to approach the former Dorchester Town forward after he was put on the transfer list by Morecambe manager Derek Adams. Ayunga ‚Äì who plays wide on the right - has scored six goals in League One, although he missed a number of games due to an injury that sidelined him for two months. The Kenya star came through at Dorchester City before he was signed by Brighton. He also had several loan moves to Burgess Hill Town, Sligo Rovers, Galway United, Poole Town,¬†and Havant and Waterlooville FC before he went back to the senior ranks with Bristol Rovers in 2020. Robinson has overseen two consecutive victories with St Mirren and has signed midfielder Keanu Baccus from Western Sydney Wanderers and Mark O‚ÄôHara from Motherwell. A deal for Trevor Carson from Dundee United is said to have been agreed. Should he complete the St Mirren move, Ayunga would have signed for his 11th team in his career.

Lampard charged by FA for comments after Everton loss to Liverpool,"Frank Lampard has been charged by the Football Association (FA) following his comments after Everton's defeat to Liverpool last month. The Everton manager criticised the referee after the 2-0 loss in the Merseyside derby, saying his side were denied a penalty that would have been given had it been a Liverpool player who went down in the box. Lampard's comments have landed him in trouble with English football's governing body, which has accused him of implying bias and attacking the integrity of referees. A statement from the FA read: ""Frank Lampard has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3 in relation to post-match media comments that me made following Everton FC's PRemier League match against Liverpool FC on Sunday 24 April 2022.  pic.twitter.com/Wi1eahSHX9 ""It is alleged that the manager's comments constitute improper conduct as they imply bias and/or attack the integrity of the match referee - or referees generally - and/or bring the game into disrepute contrary to FA Rule E3.1.

Everton are third-bottom of the table and two points from safety with just five games left to play.

'Mbappe burst out laughing!' - Tottenham transfer snub revealed by Spider-Man star Tom Holland,"Kylian Mbappe has a number of options to consider as his contract at Paris Saint-Germain runs down, but the World Cup winner has already snubbed a plea from Spider-Man star Tom Holland for him to join Tottenham. As things stand, the 22-year-old France international is due to hit free agency in the summer of 2022, with no fresh terms agreed at Parc des Princes. Leading clubs from across Europe are hoping to enter into discussions from January, with La Liga giants Real Madrid expected to lead the charge, but there appears to be little chance of a global icon heading to north London. London-born actor Holland, who stars in the upcoming Marvel blockbuster 'Spider-Man: No Way Home', has revealed that he was snubbed when making a play for Mbappe on behalf of the team he supports at the recent Ballon d‚ÄôOr ceremony in Paris. He has told LADbible: ‚ÄúWe went to the Ballon d‚ÄôOr [ceremony] the other day and met Messi, it was crazy. ‚ÄúWe met Mbappe, I actually asked Mbappe ‚Äòhey, nice to meet you‚Äô, and he was really friendly. And I said ‚Äòmate, you have to come to Tottenham‚Äô, and he just burst out laughing.‚Äù Mbappe was caught on camera telling Holland it would be ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù for him to link up with Spurs, but he does have some big decisions to make on his future. There is every chance that he will be on the move next year, with PSG thus far having been unable to thrash out fresh terms with one of the most sought-after talents on the planet. They have seen Mbappe register 124 goals for them through 150 appearances, but are in serious danger of seeing one of their star players slip their net. Real have made no secret of their desire to acquire a long-standing target, after seeing a big-money approach knocked back in the summer of 2021, and remain confident that they can add another ‚ÄòGalactico‚Äô to their ranks. Spurs, meanwhile, will have to turn their attention elsewhere, amid ongoing questions of how long Harry Kane will be sticking around at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with Antonio Conte currently being linked with in-demand Fiorentina striker Dusan Vlahovic.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-snubs-tottenham-transfer-plea-spider-man-star-tom/blt52275b0414b04ce9,Chris Burton,0de7d294-06bc-4f44-ba7e-7f277a8a1df3

Championship Wrap: Solanke continues scoring run in Bournemouth win,"Dominic Solanke continued his scoring form in the Championship with a goal in Bournemouth's 3-0 victory over Huddersfield Town on Saturday. Solanke assisted Jaidon Anthony for the opening goal in the 19th minute and he wrapped up their win with a goal immediately after the restart, off Philip Billing's assist. The 24-year-old is enjoying his best scoring run in a league season with 23 goals in 36 matches and he has now scored at least a goal in his last three appearances for Bournemouth. He is second behind Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic in the Championship scoring chart who has scored 35 goals so far. Solanke played for 88 minutes while Zimbabwe's Jordan Zemura played the entire duration for Bournemouth who remain second in the league table with 69 points after 36 games, eight points behind leaders Fulham. At bet365 Stadium, Nigeria striker Josh Maja played for over 90 minutes in Stoke City's 2-0 triumph over Millwall. Jacob Brown's opener and George Saville's own goal secured maximum points for the Potters to rise to 15th in the Championship table with 49 points after 38 matches.

'Barcelona is my home!' - Iniesta 'would love' to return to Camp Nou,"Andres Iniesta has opened the door to a potential return to Barcelona, admitting that he still sees the club as his ""home"". Iniesta enjoyed a glittering career at Camp Nou spanning almost two decades as he became a multiple La Liga and Champions League winner. The midfielder played a key role in one of Barca's greatest-ever sides alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Xavi, but left the club in 2018 before heading to Vissel Kobe in Japan. Iniesta is set to turn 38 in May, but has no plans to hang up his boots just yet and would welcome the chance to head back to Catalunya if the opportunity were to arise. ‚ÄúI would love to return to Barcelona,"" he told Gerard Romeo on Twitch. ""I would like to help the institution. There are many variables involved and it is difficult to know what will happen in the future. ‚ÄúBarca is my home and I couldn‚Äôt be anywhere better than there. Today I like to think a lot about playing. That‚Äôs what fascinates me the most today."" Pressed on whether he plans to move into coaching when he retires, Iniesta added: ""Time is running against me as they say, but I do not know where I see myself when I retire. ‚ÄúMany times it crosses my mind that I would like to get the title of coach or prepare to be a sporting director.

"Milner signs one-year Liverpool extension after rejecting offers from Aston Villa, Newcastle and MLS","James Milner has signed a one-year contract extension at Liverpool after rejecting offers from Aston Villa, Newcastle and a number of MLS clubs. Milner initially arrived at Liverpool on a free transfer from Manchester City in 2015, and has since made 289 appearances for the club in all competitions. 39 of those came in 2021-22 as the versatile midfielder helped the Reds win FA Cup and League Cup honours, but he was set to become a free agent on June 30. Liverpool have now confirmed that Milner has renewed his contract with the club for one more season. We are delighted to announce that @JamesMilner has signed a new contract extension with the Reds üôåüî¥ pic.twitter.com/uaSHd0W4nJ GOAL can confirm that the 36-year-old has accepted a reduced wage packet in order to prolong his Anfield career, during which he has also picked up his third Premier League title and a Champions League winners' medal. Villa and Newcastle had expressed an interest in signing Milner on a free transfer but he has rejected both of his former clubs. The England international has also passed up the chance to take on a new challenge in the United States, with Liverpool head coach Jurgen Klopp getting his wish after pushing for the club to retain his services. Joe Gomez's future at Liverpool has also been a hot topic of discussion in recent months, with the centre-half no longer guaranteed a regular spot in Klopp's starting XI. The 25-year-old provided cover at the back for the Reds last season though, and GOAL has learned he is also in line for a new deal. Gomez's current contract is due to expire in 2024, but Liverpool are likely to extend that agreement in order to ward off any potential suitors in the summer transfer window.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/milner-liverpool-extension-rejects-offers-villa-newcastle/blt0985c7b612b08739,Neil Jones,e56d97ee-dca0-466f-aa81-e27812799d3e
PSG fans booing Messi 'unbelievable' - Pochettino,"Mauricio Pochettino says it is ""unbelievable"" that some Paris Saint-Germain fans continued to boo Lionel Messi after his star turn against Lens on Saturday, which helped the club clinch their 10th Ligue 1 title. Messi has endured a frustrating debut campaign at PSG, having joined the club on a free transfer following his surprise departure from Barcelona last summer. The 34-year-old's output in the final third has dropped considerably and he was unable to inspire the team beyond the round of 16 in the Champions League, with supporters singling him out for blame alongside Neymar. Messi and Neymar were both subjected to boos after PSG's loss to Real Madrid, and the former was targeted again following his latest outing against Lens. PSG earned the point they needed to regain the Ligue 1 title with a 1-1 draw against Franck Haise's side, with Messi scoring the goal with a superb long-range shot, but he was still jeered by a section of home fans during the post-match celebrations. Head coach Pochettino was left baffled by the reception for the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, and told ESPN Argentina: ""The whistles against Messi? It's unbelievable. These are hard things to accept. A difficult situation to imagine and which cannot be understood in my opinion.  ""All the more so with the greatness of Messi, what he gives and will continue to give to football."" Messi scored 38 goals across all competitions in his final season at Barcelona, but has only managed nine so far in 2021-22. Only four of those have been recorded in Ligue 1, with PSG relying more on Kylian Mbappe as their main source of goals as the Frenchman has netted 33 in 42 appearances. Messi has however also provided 13 assists, and after adding Ligue 1 to his trophy collection he is now just four pieces of silverware behind former Barca team-mate Dani Alves' all-time record of 43.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-fans-booing-messi-unbelievable-pochettino/bltd15fedeeb21fe971,James Westwood,0e702fc1-b1c9-47a7-848a-20982fc67586
'Gio is back! Very cool' -  USMNT star Reyna set to return for Borussia Dortmund says manager Rose,"Borussia Dortmund boss Marco Rose has confirmed Gio Reyna is back in his plans, with the United States international midfielder fully recovered from a lengthy spell on the sidelines. The 19-year-old playmaker has been out of action since picking up an injury while on World Cup qualifying duty with his country in September 2021. It has been a long road back for the USMNT star, but he is returning to contention at Dortmund ahead of their Bundesliga clash with Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday. Asked for an update on Reyna‚Äôs fitness, Rose told reporters: ‚ÄúGio is back! Very cool! ‚ÄúHe really wants to be there, had another two good weeks of training. To see him back and to have his quality again is nice and important for us.‚Äù Reyna suffered a hamstring injury against El Salvador and has been out of action ever since. A return to training was made in November, but no risks have been taken with him as Dortmund ease him back into the fold. He will be hoping to see some game time against Leverkusen after sitting out 25 games in all competitions at club level and a further 11 fixtures for USA. While Reyna is back in contention, Dortmund have a number of other senior stars out of action. Emre Can, Erling Haaland and Mats Hummels have all been nursing knocks, with only the latter standing a chance of facing Leverkusen. Rose added: ‚ÄúIt's not expected that any of the three will join us for tomorrow's final training.

""Everyone knows how good he (Ozil) is, so I'd have to say him,"" Smith Rowe told GOAL while appearing on Simply The Best. England international Smith Rowe answered a range of questions, including the best player he has ever come up against, the best match he has ever played in, and the best goal he has ever netted.

Man Utd star Ronaldo leaves Old Trafford before full-time after being handed first start under Ten Hag,"Cristiano Ronaldo was included in Manchester United's starting XI to face Rayo Vallecano amid the ongoing rumours linking him with a summer transfer, but he did not stick around to hear the final whistle. The 37-year-old made Erik ten Hag's lineup despite not featuring in any of the Red Devils' previous five pre-season fixtures. Ronaldo indicated he was set to feature against Rayo on social media as he told his followers ""the king plays"", leading to speculation he would come off the bench, but Ten Hag decided to use him right from the off at Old Trafford. Ten Hag initially confirmed that Ronaldo would be in his squad for the Rayo friendly clash after United's 1-0 loss to Atletico Madrid in Spain on Saturday. The Dutchman admitted that the veteran forward is still a long way behind the rest of his senior team-mates in terms of fitness, however, having only just seen him return from an extended break. ""He is not on the level of the rest of the squad because he missed a lot of weeks,"" ten Hag told Viaplay. ""But he needs games and he needs training, a lot."" Ronaldo played the first 45 minutes of United's 1-1 draw with Rayo before being substituted for Amad Diallo at the interval. The striker was then seen leaving Old Trafford before the final whistle, and it has not yet been confirmed by the club whether or not his departure was sanctioned by Ten Hag. Ronaldo shared the spotlight with ¬£46.5 million ($57m) summer signing Lisandro Martinez, with the former Ajax defender handed a centre-back berth alongside Raphael Varane. Christian Eriksen made Ten Hag's line-up after a cameo showing against Atletico, while Argentine youngster Alejandro Garnacho and Donny van de Beek were also included. üìã Presenting today's team news...#MUFC GOAL confirmed that Ronaldo had handed in a transfer request earlier this summer, on the back of a dismal 2021-22 campaign for United that saw them drop out of the Champions League.

The likes of Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Atletico and Barcelona have all distanced themselves from Ronaldo, while a potential homecoming at Sporting CP has also been ruled out at this stage. United have publicly insisted that the five-time Ballon d'Or winner will not be sold and, as it stands, he will be available for their 2022-23 season opener against Brighton next weekend.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-starts-for-man-utd-ten-hag-rayo-vallecano-friendly/blt789878baa6a3e086,James Westwood,7e636bbd-bed8-4242-a81d-49b11c01f87b
"Villarreal vs Juventus: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Villarreal welcome Juventus to the Estadio de la Ceramica on Tuesday evening, as Unai Emery's side aim to claim a victory in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 clash. The Yellow Submarine come into the clash in strong domestic form having won seven of their last 10 La Liga matches, while in Europe this season they have played well despite losing both home and away to Manchester United. Juve, meanwhile, are unbeaten in 90 minutes since November and finished top of their Champions League group, ahead of holders Chelsea following five wins from their six matches. The Europa League champions are favourites to claim a win on Tuesday night with bet365 offering them at 29/20 (2.45). The Italians for their part lost their last away match in the knockout stages last season against Porto and can be backed at 2/1 (3.00) with the draw available at 11/5 (3.20). Villarreal are missing their top scorer from last season Gerard Moreno, so Dutch international Arnaut Danjuma is likely to lead the line for the hosts. The former Bournemouth forward has already scored four times in the Champions League this term and is priced at 9/2 (5.50) just ahead of Juve's new signing Dusan Vlahovic who is offered at 5/1 (6.00). Alvaro Morata, meanwhile, has plenty of experience of scoring important goals in this competition and the Spanish striker is available at 11/2 (6.50) to break the deadlock. The key for Villarreal to progress will be taking their chances, with Emery's men guilty of being extremely wasteful in the competition so far. Against Manchester United they spurned countless chances to score, while domestically they have also lacked at times a cutting edge, underperforming their expected goals in La Liga. Juventus, meanwhile, have kept four clean sheets in their six Champions League matches so far, and while the Turin outfit may be missing some defensive players, they will feel they can frustrate Villarreal and take a good result back to northern Italy. There should be some interest in opposing a high scoring game and the price of 11/10 (2.10) for under 2.5 goals and both teams to score 'no' looks appealing.

2022 World Cup Qualifiers: The role of history in Ghana vs Nigeria - Akpeyi,"Nigeria and Kaizer Chiefs custodian Daniel Akpeyi insists Ghana's better record will play no part as the rivals battle for a World Cup ticket. The Black Stars have defeated the Super Eagles 25 times in the 56 meetings while their rivals have claimed wins on 12 occasions. 19 games have ended in draws. On Friday, March 25, Ghana will host Nigeria at the Baba Yara Stadium aiming at getting an advantage.  ""For me, history does not really work for football. What works for football is the preparation for today,"" Akpeyi said as quoted by IOL. ""Currently, we are doing well and we have been to the last three World Cups. This is not going to be any different. It is not going to be a walk in the park but we are going to give our heart out there."" ""We have a crop of good players who are able to help Nigeria qualify for Qatar. Ghana is also a strong team, there has been a rivalry between the countries on many things. Football is a big part of this and at the end of the day, it is the team that prepares very well and gets ready to take their chances and defend well. This is the team that will qualify."" The last time Nigeria defeated Ghana was in the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) where they won by a solitary goal. Since then, the teams have met five times in all competitions with the Black Stars winning twice while the other two matches have ended goalless, in regulation time. The latest meeting was in the African Nations Championship (Chan), held in South Africa. Though, this was not the proper national teams.

Brighton's Lallana 'embarrassed' by lack of knowledge of new Liverpool star Luis Diaz,"Brighton midfielder Adam Lallana admits that he was ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù at not having heard of Luis Diaz before the attacker's move from Porto to Liverpool. Diaz has hit the ground running at Anfield, impressing with his performances and providing the Reds' fearsome frontline with healthy competition for a starting spot. And Lallana, a former Liverpool player himself, has been stunned by the Colombian's instant impact after arriving at Anfield. ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe how well Diaz has settled, having been a player that has gone to Liverpool and knowing how difficult it was to settle,‚Äù the former England international told BBC Radio 5 Live Sport. ‚ÄúI am not sure what Diaz‚Äôs English is like. But coming from a different country in January, and to play the way he has played, is absolutely phenomenal.‚Äù Having been in the ground for Liverpool's Carabao Cup final win over Chelsea, Lallana added: ‚ÄúI was at Wembley, to see how he performed, I think he was Liverpool‚Äôs best player and most dynamic. ‚ÄúI actually feel a little embarrassed that I hadn‚Äôt heard about him before.

Simeone complains about Atletico Madrid's transfer strategy after title defence slump,"Diego Simeone has admitted to frustration with the make-up of his Atletico Madrid squad this season after the Rojiblancos spluttered in their title defence in La Liga. The Wanda Metropolitano outfit were forced to watch from a distance as rivals Real Madrid seized the crown back after a soft domestic campaign. Atletico were forced to contend with key injuries throughout the campaign, and now Simeone has admitted that he had difficulties with the construction of his overall team. ‚ÄúWe have to adjust quite a few things,"" Simeone stated. ""We suffered the loss of [Kieran] Trippier, which we didn‚Äôt resolve as I would have liked. Marcos doesn‚Äôt feel as comfortable there and couldn‚Äôt show his potential. ""Vrsaljko played and didn‚Äôt play, Wass couldn‚Äôt get into it. In the end it‚Äôs all or nothing and it‚Äôs more difficult to give people opportunities when you‚Äôre in a tough situation. We suffered a lot with our centre-backs. ""They sound like excuses but they‚Äôre realities. I didn‚Äôt know how to resolve it. With Reinildo we maintained more stability and in those 10 matches we conceded 5 goals. The team was stronger defending and it generated more regularity."" Simeone will be starting to lay the groundwork for his squad ahead of the 2022-23 campaign now, and several key chances will be made among the ranks of the Rojiblancos.

'I also blame Ten Hag!' - Evra claims Man Utd flops that 'don't respect the badge' have 'fooled' new manager,"Former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra claims new manager Erik ten Hag has been ""fooled"" by some of his players at Old Trafford who ""don't respect the badge"". Ten Hag has overseen humiliating defeats to Brighton and Brentford in the team's first two Premier League games of the new season. The Dutchman also faces a daunting fixture up next with Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool set to visit Old Trafford on Monday night. Evra has not been too surprised by Manchester United's poor start and has told Betfair he feels the players are psychologically broken. ""It's deja vu and I'm not surprised. I see the same players, there's no confidence and I think we have got carried away with the pre-season,"" he said. ""When the league starts things are totally different, sometimes I even prefer to have a bad pre-season, then it means you have to work hard, your legs are heavy.  ""When you're too sharp in pre-season and you look good, that means you're not working hard enough. ""I also blame Ten Hag - he's been fooled by all those players, the same way other managers have been fooled by them. ""In pre-season they looked so good, and he would have been excited to make them even better, but no. Psychologically they are broken."" Evra also criticised the United players for the lack of fight shown in their two Premier League defeats and admitted he's angry with the performances he's seen so far. ""If they don't fight anymore it's because those players don't want to be there and they don't respect the badge. Let's be clear. Brentford were 4-0 up after 35 minutes,"" he added. ""When I saw that I wasn't surprised, and that's the worst part. What did we expect after seeing the same midfield, the same team, what does anyone expect? ""I don't know if Ten Hag wanted different players. I don't know if he wanted to get rid of some players but they couldn't because their salary was too high. ""That's why I'm angry with the players because it's down to them."" Manchester United will move above Liverpool in the table with a win over the Reds.

"Chelsea vs Arsenal: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Arsenal travel to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday for a Premier League derby with Chelsea as Mikel Arteta's side aim to keep alive their top-four hopes. The Gunners spurned a glorious chance to cut the gap on the Champions League-chasing sides at the weekend by losing to Southampton, and Arsenal know they cannot afford many more slip-ups if they want to bring Champions League football back to the Emirates Stadium next season. The Blues, meanwhile, remain third, but could do with a win to all but seal their place in the top four. Thomas Tuchel's men have won six of their last seven Premier League clashes and bet365 offer the hosts at 5/6 (1.83) on Wednesday evening. Arsenal, for their part, have lost four of their last five matches and can be backed at 10/3 (4.33) to get back to winning ways, with the draw offered at 13/5 (3.60). Kai Havertz is offered at 5/1 (6.00) to break the deadlock, the same price as the Blues' out-of-favour Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku. Mason Mount has been in excellent scoring form for the west Londoners, netting in each of their last three competitive fixtures and the England international is offered at 13/2 (7.50) to open the scoring. For the visitors, Alexandre Lacazette is the shortest priced player to score first at 15/2 (8.50) while Gabriel Martinelli can be backed at 9/1 (10.00). Since their 3-1 defeat at the hands of Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final first leg, the Blues have responded superbly, with a 6-0 Premier League triumph over Southampton, a 3-2 win at the Bernabeu and a 2-0 FA Cup semi-final victory over Crystal Palace. Champions League football for next season has not yet mathematically been secured and Chelsea will be highly motivated for the visit of their north London rivals. Arsenal, by contrast, have hit a dreadful run of form just at the wrong time and the Gunners have shown a lack of killer instinct in the final third. With Chelsea playing well and keen to continue their impressive run of performances it could be a tough evening in west London for Arteta's side. The price of 5/6 (1.83) for Chelsea to win should be big enough to appeal, while backing the hosts to keep a clean sheet at 11/8 (2.38) could also be of interest.

'Man City are the club for Pochettino' - Ex-PSG boss told he could follow Guardiola at the Etihad Stadium,"Mauricio Pochettino has been backed to succeed Pep Guardiola as Manchester City manager by ex-striker Trevor Sinclair. Pochettino is out of a job after he was sacked by Paris Saint-Germain this summer following a disappointing season in which they were eliminated from the Champions League at the last-16 stage. The Argentine had previously been seen as a candidate to take over at Manchester United, but the Red Devils opted to hire Erik ten Hag to assume control this summer. Instead, Pochettino could end up continuing his coaching career with the blue half of Manchester, as Sinclair believes he would be a good option to replace Guardiola. ""You look at him and he knows how to deal with egos. He seems to have a fantastic rapport with players,"" Sinclair said on TalkSport. ""It doesn't matter how big the players are, we have seen him managing [Lionel] Messi, [Kylian] Mbappe and Neymar. So on that side of things, I think he is safe hands.  ""He is a charming man and I think he comes across well in the media. ""I actually feel that Manchester City might be the club for him. I think he might have a bit of a sabbatical now, because I'm sure he is not struggling for finances. ""But I think Manchester City could be the one for him. If Guardiola walks away at a certain stage, that might be a hot seat ready to take for Pochettino."" Guardiola's current contract at City expires at the end of the 2022-23 campaign. The coach will have spent seven years with the club by the time his deal runs out and he suggested last August that he will not commit to an extension. ""Next step will be a national team, if there is a possibility. A national team is the next step,‚Äù he said. ""After seven years on this team, I think I‚Äôm going to have a stop.

Mamelodi Sundowns coach Mokwena finds Klopp inspiration after Petro de Luanda defeat,"Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach Rhulani Mokwena has found inspiration in Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp after their defeat to Petro de Luanda on Saturday. In a pulsating match in the Luanda, both teams spurned numerous other chances to score, with Masandawana also hitting the woodwork through Themba Zwane and having a late goal from Neo Maema ruled offside. With the second leg to come on Saturday evening at the FNB Stadium in Soweto, all is not lost for Sundowns in their quest to qualify for the semi-finals. And commenting after the game in Luanda, Downs co-coach Mokwena revealed that he will turn to the words of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp for inspiration, explaining that it was a match Sundowns could possibly afford to lose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm reminded of something Jurgen Klopp actually told me when I visited Melwood,"" he was quoted by iDiskiTimes. ""I never thought I‚Äôd use it because I‚Äôm a coach that wants to win every single match.

Masandawana are trying to win the Caf Champions League for the second time, having claimed the trophy in 2016 under former coach Pitso Mosimane.

Mbappe will still be in the prime of his career at 26 years old when his PSG extension runs out, so he will likely be an in-demand player in 2025. Real Madrid will have almost certainly made big-money signings in the interim, though, and it remains to be seen whether they will hold a grudge against the French star.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-dream-never-over-mbappe-leaves-door-open-for/blt2c0f7a32975ebb0f,Dan Bernstein,e8f0ebf2-494d-4145-aff5-fdd7a7c0185b
Mane praises Liverpool's care for Muslim players during Ramadan,"Sadio Mane is delighted with the attention Liverpool have paid to their Muslim players throughout the Ramadan period, stating that the club has gone above and beyond to accommodate their needs.  During Ramadan, which this year runs from April 1 to May 1, practicing Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset for the entirety of the month.  And to ensure that Liverpool players did not feel any ill-effects from their fasting, the Reds were happy to change their training and dietary systems in order to keep Mane and his team-mates in top condition.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy because playing and training and doing Ramadan isn‚Äôt easy at all,‚Äù Mane explained to beIN Sports.  ‚ÄúBut before Ramadan we tried to talk to the captain and to tell the boss maybe can we change the schedule? We train in the morning. It‚Äôs easier for us. If you train in the morning then you have time to rest and go home. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be tough if not because if you train around two or three it‚Äôs going to be tough. They said yes and I think that made it easier. We are trying to do our best. ‚ÄúGame day is something else but with Ramadan it‚Äôs tough. Liverpool tried to make everything easier for us. We spoke with our nutritionist, especially before the game she did everything easier for us.‚Äù Mane was speaking on the eve of Liverpool's Champions League semi-final first leg with Villarreal, which kicks off on Wednesday.  Having already won the Carabao Cup this term, the Champions League is one of three further trophies the Reds are chasing in order to complete an historic treble.  In May Jurgen Klopp's men will take on Chelsea in the FA Cup final, while they trail Manchester City at the Premier League summit by just a single point with five games yet to play.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-praises-liverpool-care-for-muslim-players-during/blt1da5ed484f742711,Daniel Edwards,a43f06f6-2b17-477a-9682-b0d53a51527e
De Bruyne will need ‚Äòright club‚Äô to keep playing beyond the end of Man City contract,"Kevin De Bruyne is open to the idea of prolonging his playing days beyond the end of his current Manchester City contract, but he is reluctant to speculate on where he could be at that point as he will need ‚Äúthe right club, the right challenge‚Äù in order to retain professional ambition. That is not a problem at present, with the 30-year-old Belgium international looking to chase down more major honours in 2021-22 and add to what is already an enviable collection of medals. He will be back for more next season, as he works on a contract through to 2025, but is wary of predicting when a distinguished career could come to a close and if he could seek another challenge away from the Etihad Stadium at some stage. Two-time PFA Player of the Year De Bruyne told Metro when quizzed on his future plans and whether he is currently at his peak: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about my prime years. ‚ÄúThere is a misconception that you are past your prime at 31! I feel good and I‚Äôm playing good, so hopefully I can carry on for as long as possible. ‚ÄúI have another three years on my contract here and that‚Äôs a long time. As long as I‚Äôm fit and feel happy I‚Äôll play but it‚Äôs hard to decide now how long that will be. ‚ÄúI can see myself still playing at 35, 36 but it has to be the right club, the right challenge.‚Äù When the heat is on, Kevin De Bruyne stays ice-cold üßä pic.twitter.com/z2ch82q7sR De Bruyne signed his most recent contract with City in May 2021, with a two-year extension to his previous terms agreed at that stage. He has remained a talismanic presence for the Blues since then and is fast closing in on 300 appearances for the club. That mark will be hit before the current campaign is out, with Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side continuing to chase down silverware at home and abroad.

Man City must rediscover their menace ahead of season-defining April,"Atletico Madrid and Liverpool at home, Atletico Madrid away, and Liverpool on neutral ground. It is a run of games that would give every manager nightmares - even Pep Guardiola.  But that - along with a trip to Turf Moor to face Burnley - is what faces Manchester City in April when they return from the international break; fixtures that will go a long way to determining how successful their season will be.  And it is an even more frightening sequence for Guardiola when you consider that his side has lost some of its  own menace at just the wrong moment in the campaign.  Self-doubt has crept in as the hunt for silverware gets serious, and Guardiola is desperate for his players to remember how good they are, and have been for the majority of the season. ‚ÄúWe are a decent team if we don‚Äôt forget to play,‚Äù he said after Sunday's 4-1 FA Cup win over Southampton.  A home defeat to Tottenham and a goalless draw away at Crystal Palace has seen City lose their momentum in the Premier League, just as Liverpool‚Äôs has been gathering remorselessly.  The treble and the greatest season in the club‚Äôs history remains a distinct possibility, and the potential gains that could come out of that intimidating upcoming run of fixtures is something that City would normally relish. A single point advantage at the top of the Premier League could become four with a victory over Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium. A place in the Champions League semi-finals is eminently achievable against an Atletico side that struggled to get past Manchester United in the previous round. And an FA Cup semi-final against Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side at Wembley Stadium will be another thriller, with a win potentially enough to officially end the Reds' quadruple dreams.  The negatives, though, are that City's season could unravel quickly if the current pattern of unconvincing performances continues.  At Palace on Monday, they played well without scoring. Against Southampton, they scored without playing well until the game was largely over.  Phil Foden‚Äôs fabulous thunderbolt for the third goal killed the tie, but moments earlier, Zack Steffen had made a huge save from Che Adams to deny the Saints a second equaliser that would have set up a thrilling finale. ùóîùó∞ùóµùó∂ùó≤ùòÉùó≤ùó∫ùó≤ùóªùòÅ ùó®ùóªùóπùóºùó∞ùó∏ùó≤ùó±: Top üóë@PhilFoden scores a beauty!@ManCity #EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/qHeIDcHoZk ‚ÄúAt Crystal Palace, we missed chances in the six-yard box,‚Äù Guardiola said. ‚ÄúMy players don‚Äôt always understand why these things happen, but it‚Äôs just football. Then they come here and see the opposite side.  ‚ÄúJust relax and improve - we have been together for six seasons and have been many times in the FA Cup semi-final.‚Äù The edginess was clear in the performance against Southampton. Raheem Sterling scored the opening goal, but snatched at other good opportunities, Jack Grealish lost his confidence in the final third, Steffen was slow off his line and Aymeric Laporte stabbed at Che Adams‚Äô cross to put the ball into his own net for the Saints' equaliser.  But the pretty passes and thrilling football were back when the game was over, as they cut open their hosts for a superb fourth goal when Joao Cancelo‚Äôs outrageous pass with the outside of his foot picked out Ilkay Gundogan, who in turn teed up Riyad Mahrez to provide the finish. Magical Mahrez ü™ÑThe top scorer remaining in the competition delivers again!@Mahrez22 @ManCity #EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/kEyPru2CPP Starting games with that belief will be crucial going forward, and ensuring it happens will be a test of Guardiola's man-mangement skills. So often the spring international break can be a momentum-breaker, but a two-week distraction could be just what the Catalan needs to settle his players.  As they head off to different part of the world, the City boss will also take a break, but the punishing schedule will not be too far from his thoughts.   ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt see each other for a while,"" he said. ""We‚Äôll see some new faces and after we come back, we know what we have - quarter-final of Champions League, last games of the Premier League and semi-final of the FA Cup.  ‚ÄúArriving in the last stages of the season, we are there, fighting for the titles, and that is so nice.  ‚ÄúI would have signed, at the beginning of the season, for today to be in this position.

'Fake news!' - Augsburg respond to false quote that USMNT star Pepi was peed on during club initiation,"Augsburg have labelled a quote claiming that United States national team star Ricardo Pepi was peed on by Markus Weinzierl as part of a club initiation ceremony ""fake news"". Pepi became Augsburg's new club-record signing when he arrived in Bavaria from FC Dallas for ‚Ç¨18 million (¬£15m/$20m) on January 3, with the 19-year-old committing to a four-and-a-half-year contract. Augsburg beat a number of top European clubs to Pepi's signature, including Liverpool and Bayern Munich, but his start to life in Germany has been marred slightly by online trolls. Pepi gave an interview to Sport Bild earlier this week outlining his ambitions as an Augsburg player, setting his sights on Champions League qualification while also singling out Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski as his main role model. A fake quote from that interview subsequently began doing the rounds on social media, with it claimed that Augsburg boss Weinzierl welcomed the teenager to the club by urinating on him in the showers at the club training ground. The Bundesliga outfit have now come out to rubbish the report, writing on Twitter: ""Actually obvious that this 'quote' is fake! We can laugh about a lot and often don't take ourselves too seriously.  ""But since some of you out there seem to think so, let's make it clear that this is fake."" Pepi was handed his Augsburg debut in their 3-1 loss at Hoffenheim on January 8 as he came on for the final 30 minutes when the visitors were trying to get back into the game. The American forward impressed enough to make Weinzierl's starting XI in their next Bundesliga outing, playing 84 minutes of a 1-1 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt. Pepi looked lively in his first home game for the club and might have scored twice on another day as he squandered two clear openings, but will likely have the chance to break his duck again when Augsburg take on Bayer Leverkusen this weekend.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fake-news-augsburg-respond-to-false-quote-that-usmnt-star/bltda209e30927701ef,James Westwood,d1334a3b-eaec-45a4-8b8d-4ed6fe620335
Champions League final moved to Stade de France in Paris as Russia is stripped of hosting duties by UEFA,"UEFA has announced the 2022 Champions League final will be moved to Stade de France in Paris following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg stripped of hosting duties. Political tension in Eastern Europe has forced decisive action, with an extraordinary meeting held on Thursday chaired by UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin. The final, scheduled to take place on May 28, is now set to be held in the French capital. A statement from UEFA reads: ‚ÄúThe UEFA Executive Committee today held an extraordinary meeting following the grave escalation of the security situation in Europe. ‚ÄúThe UEFA Executive Committee decided to relocate the final of the 2021/22 UEFA Men‚Äôs Champions League from Saint Petersburg to Stade de France in Saint-Denis.

Darren Fletcher at Man Utd: What is his role & what does he do as technical director?,"Darren Fletcher has explained a slight change to his role at Manchester United since the arrival of Ralf Rangnick.¬† The former Red Devils midfielder was given a role as technical director last year but, following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the Scotsman has been seen on the bench next to Rangnick and Chris Armas. Given Fletcher‚Äôs senior job title it has confused some as to why he regularly takes training sessions and is seen on the pitch during warm-ups and Rangnick himself admitted last week he didn‚Äôt know what his role is. But the 38-year-old has moved to clarify his position.¬† Speaking at a meeting of the Fans‚Äô Forum, Fletcher explained what his role is and how it has changed since Rangnick arrived.¬† ‚ÄúWith Ralf and his staff coming in, and Michael (Carrick) and Kieran (McKenna) choosing to move on, we had a quick transition process, so part of my role has been to assist with that, both on the training pitch and during games,‚Äù he explained.¬† ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs been the most visible part for me this season, but that‚Äôs really an addition to my overall technical director role. ‚ÄúProbably the key part of the role is taking a holistic view of the path for players from our academy to our first team. That pipeline of academy talent is a massive part of who we are as a club.‚Äù Interim Manchester United manager Rangnick was asked about Fletcher‚Äôs role last week.¬† ""Well, I can only talk about what I've experienced in the last 11 to 12 weeks. He has always been part of almost every training session and each game,‚Äù he said.¬† ""Whenever I have had a question about what he thinks, because he obviously knows the players, he has known them for a long time. I could always, and will always, ask him for his opinion. So it is good to have him in the team. ""What is his role with regard to the club? I don't really know, to be honest. I can only tell you what is happening in the training sessions, around the training sessions and around the games. In those areas, it is good to have him on board."" Fletcher was appointed as technical director last March alongside John Murtough who became the club‚Äôs first football director. The pair are heavily involved with club recruitment and both were involved in the interview process which brought Rangnick to the club.¬† Fletcher is particularly involved in getting youth players through to the first team and has a close relationship with head of academy Nick Cox. Speaking further about his role he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working closely with Nick Cox, as head of academy, to look at the long-term strategy for bringing players through.¬† ‚ÄúWe have to manage the balance between allowing them to develop and creating the right steps for that, without piling the pressure onto them. ‚ÄúAlong with Nick, I‚Äôm looking at how we best use the loan system to give academy players invaluable experience at other clubs.¬† ‚ÄúWe currently have 13 young players and academy products on loan and playing regularly in other divisions or leagues. ‚ÄúHopefully we‚Äôll see players like Brandon Williams, Teden Mengi, Jimmy Garner, Ethan Laird, Tahith Chong, and Amad Diallo reap the benefits of that. All of them are doing really well on loan and we‚Äôre excited to bring them back in pre-season to see how they fare with our first-team players. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a brilliant experience since I took on the role, and the combination of long-term planning and contributing to our strategic goals, with the opportunity to still be close to the team and management, makes it a unique role.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/darren-fletcher-man-utd-what-is-his-role-what-does-he-do-as/blt744297e2e7bd6dca,Charlotte Duncker,4cfc5074-a177-466e-b7b0-82591fb1c870
Spurs exit Europe after forfeiting final UEFA Europa Conference League group stage game following Covid outbreak,"Tottenham are out of Europe after being forced to forfeit their final UEFA Europa Conference League group stage game against Rennes, with the fixture initially called off due to a Covid-19 outbreak in the Spurs camp. Antonio Conte‚Äôs side had been due to host Ligue 1 opposition on December 9, but cancelled the game after a number of players and coaches contracted coronavirus. Rennes expressed their disappointment at the time at seeing the game postponed at such short notice, and European football‚Äôs governing body has now awarded them a 3-0 victory as no rearranged date can be set. A statement from UEFA read: ‚ÄúFollowing several positive cases of Covid-19 that were identified from players and staff of Tottenham Hotspur, the 2021/22 UEFA Europa Conference League group stage match between Spurs and Stade Rennais could not be played. ‚ÄúBased on the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations and given the urgent circumstances of the matter, the ad-hoc chairman of the Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body referred the case to the Appeals Body. The chairman took the following decision: ‚ÄúTo declare the 2021/22 UEFA Europa Conference League group stage match between Tottenham Hotspur and Stade Rennais, as forfeited by Spurs who is therefore deemed to have lost the match 0-3.‚Äù The result means Spurs will finish third in Group G, ending their continental commitments for 2021-22 with no spot earned in the Europa Conference League knockout round play-offs. Vitesse will move forward to that stage, where they will face Austrian club Rapid Vienna. Tottenham, who only collected seven points in the inaugural groupo stage, can now focus their full attention on domestic matters.

How PSG convinced Mbappe to sign new contract and snub Real Madrid transfer,"How did Paris Saint-Germain convince Kylian Mbappe to sign a new contract and snub a transfer to Real Madrid? GOAL has all the details. Mbappe's previous contract was due to expire on June 30 and it was widely reported that Madrid already had an agreement in place to sign the striker on a free transfer. A final deal never came to fruition, however, with Mbappe ultimately deciding to pen fresh terms with PSG that will keep him at Parc des Princes for another three years. GOAL can confirm that PSG have made Mbappe their highest-paid player after tying him to a new deal, with the 23-year-old now on a more lucrative salary than the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar. Mbappe is also set to receive a signing bonus of over ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£85m/$106m) and club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has promised him there will be wholesale changes at both boardroom and squad level. Sporting director Leonardo is among those set to exit the club, with Luis Campos in line to replace the Brazilian after successful spells in the same role at Monaco and Lille. Mbappe has been assured of an improved sporting project at PSG this time around, which will no longer include an obsession with acquiring star names - as was the case last summer when Messi, Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Archraf Hakimi all arrived at Parc des Princes. Mbappe's final decision was also influenced by French President Emmanuel Macron, who had spoken to the forward over the telephone several times over the last few months. Macron argued that Mbappe would be better off staying put because he is seen as an icon in Paris and could be front and centre when the Olympic Games are staged in the city in 2024. He also reminded the PSG star of his status as a role model for the next generation as he urged him to weigh up the benefits of continuing his career in his homeland. Mbappe's love for the club was also a key factor as he has a burning ambition to become their greatest-ever player and break Edinson Cavani's all-time scoring record, which he is now only 30 behind on 170 goals.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-psg-convinced-mbappe-to-sign-new-contract-and-snub-real/blt3d4b17b9db4d3280,Marc Mechenoua,d7a9c8a3-906d-4679-9c30-04c2846a72cb
Nigerian side Remo Stars deny match-fixing allegations after viral penalty shootout defeat,"Nigeria team Remo Stars have denied accusations of match-fixing following their bizarre penalty shootout defeat in the Ogun State FA Cup final against Ijebu United on Thursday. The penalty shootout between the two teams went viral as the penalty shootout was decided in controversial circumstances. Remo players seemed to purposely miss the target with their spot kicks while their goalkeeper stood perfectly still to allow on effort past him as as Ijebu triumphed 3-0 to win the competition. Despite the claims that Remo threw the game because it had been fixed the club's secretary, Michael Onikute, has told GOAL that the players were in fact protesting against the refereeing decisions during the final. ‚ÄúWell, first on the allegations of match-fixing, this is totally false,‚Äù Onikute said. ‚ÄúWhat I can deduce from the social media posts is that some individuals are trying to get much attraction by posting the [penalties] video with the word match-fixing ‚Äì because they know it would alert the football world. ‚ÄúYou will also see that they never presented a concrete explanation about the game rather than match-fixing. ‚ÄúThat shows the level of unprofessionalism of such journalists involved in the propaganda. ‚ÄúIf indeed the match was fixed, we would not have streamed the game live on our social media channels. ‚ÄúThat being said, the game in question was not even credible enough to be on any sports betting platform and all team members are banned from taking part in any form of betting activities.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúWe as a team were utmost disappointed with the level of organization, coordination and officiating of the games in the state cup. ‚ÄúJust before the end of the normal time, the match officials ended the match without the additional time and before the end of the 90th minute so the game could end in penalties. ‚ÄúWe opted not to play the penalties, but the Ogun State FA insisted we played, or risk being banned. ‚ÄúWe have been facing this challenge every year we play in the State FA Cup, and we felt we should make a statement against this,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIn fact, we have not reached the final in the last five years because of this same reason. Our decision may be weird, but I am sure the organizers now know our stand and they will do better next time."" The cup final went viral on social media on Thursday.

"San Siro: Inter and AC Milan stadium capacity, location, facts & video tour","The San Siro has been the home to some of football‚Äôs biggest talents and hosted many memorable matches. It is a must-see stadium for football fans across the globe, especially so with a re-build on the horizon. So what do you need to know when visiting? GOAL brings you the guide and all the details of the iconic San Siro stadium. Address: Via dei Piccolomini 5, 20151 Milano San Siro is located in the west of Milan, approximately 5 kilometres from Milan‚Äôs city centre. San Siro is easily accessible by train via the purple M5 metro line, which connects San Siro to the city centre. San Siro Ippodromo and San Siro Stadio are the closest stations, both of which are a short walk from the ground. If you are driving from Turin (A4), Genova (A7), or Bologna (Autostrada del Sole), make your way to the western ring road (Tangenziale Ovest) and take exit 3 to Via Novara. Once on the motorway, signs can direct you to the stadium. If arriving from the direction of Venezia, take the exit towards Viale Certos. Following the exit, signs will direct you to the stadium. Alternatively, tram 16 can take you to the stadium. Take the tram in the centre of Milan (west of Piazza Duomo) to the last stop on the line, San Siro Stadio. The trip takes about 30 minutes. The San Siro Stadium officially opened on September 19, 1926, with a friendly match between Milan and Inter. Construction of the stadium, meanwhile, began in December 1925. San Siro was originally owned by AC Milan, but was sold to the city of Milan in 1935. San Siro has a capacity of 80,018. When the stadium first opened, its four stands would hold up to 35,000, before gradual expansion began in 1939. In 1955, as a result of a grand expansion plan, the stadium‚Äôs capacity increased to 85,700. However, in 2008, due to UEFA‚Äôs safety requirements, the stadium‚Äôs capacity had to be reduced down to 80,018 and has remained the same ever since. AC Milan had been the sole occupant of San Siro until 1945, when they were joined by Inter, who had previously played at the nearby Arena Civica. Since then, both AC Milan and Inter have remained tenants of the stadium. However, in order to avoid scheduling conflicts, the two never host home matches on the same day. In addition to football matches, San Siro hosts a variety of major events such as concerts, shows, and other sporting performances. In June 1980, Bob Marley & The Wailers were the first to perform at the San Siro and, since then, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Ed Sheeran have all performed there. Concerts in the San Siro can hold up to 150,000 spectators. It has also been confirmed that the opening ceremony for the 2026 Winter Olympics will take place in the San Siro, which, by then, may have been rebuilt and look entirely different. The San Siro offers guided stadium tours which include access to the dressing rooms, hospitality areas, the press room, as well as the Milan and Inter museum. The stadium tours are open seven days a week from 10am to 6pm local time, but may vary on game or event days. Tickets can be purchased via Vivaticket, and will cost ¬£16 (‚Ç¨20) for a tour of both the stadium and museum. Alternatively you can purchase a museum-only ticket, which costs ¬£10 (‚Ç¨13).

But they were worthy of the three points with their most complete performance under Ten Hag to move them above Jurgen Klopp's side and lift some of the clouds hanging over the club.  On a night when fans protested against owners, the Glazers, both inside and outside the ground, the Theatre of Dreams also reached volumes rarely seen in recent years.  Jadon Sancho fired United into a first-half lead with some trickery in the box and then an impudent finish. And they doubled their advantage in the second half when substitute Anthony Martial set Marcus Rashford free to sweep a shot past Alisson.  It was ultimately enough to claim a victory they absolutely needed.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/manchester-united-winners-losers-ratings-ten-hag-revolution/blt6db369b171b3dd1d,James Robson,b6c42a18-dba0-4d90-becb-89274745b913
'Kind of weird' - Bayern Munich boss Nagelsmann questions Barcelona's transfers after Lewandowski move,"Barcelona's summer business in the transfer market has been ""kind of weird"", according to Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann, following Robert Lewandowski's departure to Camp Nou. The Poland international closed the book on an eight-year stay with the Bundesliga champions earlier this month to seal a move to the Catalan club. It represents yet another move by Xavi's side, following a deal for Leeds United winger Raphinha and several free-agent additions. Their activity comes despite the club reportedly being in a dire financial situation. Nagelsmann however remains somewhat baffled by the Blaugrana's consistent discussion over financial troubles, only to execute a string of major money deals that seem to go against their budget. ""They got a lot of new players, not only Robert,"" the German observed as his side prepare for a pre-season friendly against MLS outfit D.C. United. ""I don't know how to be honest, it's the only club in the world that can buy players without money. It's kind of weird and crazy.""  With president Joan Laporta frequently at pains to suggest the club's hands were tied when it came to the transfer market, it has not stopped them securing a host of major names this summer. Some, like Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen, arrived for free, with the club tempting players in free agency to join them. But in the case of Lewandowski, along with winger Raphinha signed from Leeds United, the club has spent more than many expected they would be able to manage.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kind-of-weird-bayern-nagelsmann-barcelona-transfers/blta26b30b4256161d7,Andrew Steel,f48d5a83-2e39-41ff-9ac3-704571278594
Manchester United's new look midfield: is Bruno Fernandes a positive force or a problem to fix?,"Erik ten Hag has got the No6 he craved - yet the general sense is that Manchester United‚Äôs midfield still lacks ‚Äúsomething.‚Äù That is remarkable, considering the new manager‚Äôs summer business has seen him change two thirds of a three-man engine room with the signings of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen.  Ideally, he wanted to make another addition - Frenkie de Jong being his priority target - though it is highly unlikely United would have moved for Casemiro had the Dutchman been signed first.  So what exactly is missing from a midfield with Eriksen‚Äôs vision and range of passing, Casemiro‚Äôs ball-winning and shielding, and Bruno Fernandes‚Äô goals?",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/manchester-united-s-new-look-midfield-is-bruno-fernandes-a/blt0019e4210f6dbbb7,James Robson,c02c9899-1379-4cd4-9e19-092d434d8d8f
Barcelona want to sign Ajax left-back Tagliafico before close of January transfer window to provide Alba competition,"GOAL can confirm that Barcelona want to sign Ajax left-back Nicolas Tagliafico before the January transfer window closes, having identified the 29-year-old as the ideal man to provide competition for Jordi Alba. Barca have been busier than expected in the winter market so far, snapping up Ferran Torres from Manchester City in a ‚Ç¨55 million (¬£46m/$62m) deal while also exploring potential deals for Juventus star Alvaro Morata and ex-Chelsea midfielder Oscar. The Liga giants are still actively looking for reinforcements as Xavi bids to guide the club back into the Champions League, with Tagliafico the latest player to emerge on their radar amid Alba's struggles for consistency at left-back. Alba expressed his frustration over the amount of criticism he gets after Barca's 1-0 win at Alaves on Sunday, and his spot in Xavi's starting XI could come under threat if a deal for Tagliafico can be pushed over the line. GOAL has learned that Barca are eager to sign Tagliafico on loan until the end of the season and have already made contact with Ajax to discuss his availability. The Dutch outfit are pushing for a ‚Ç¨6 million purchase option to be included in any final agreement, while the Blaugrana have suggested sending La Masia graduate Alejandro Balde to Johan Cruyff ArenA as part of the deal. Barca still need to offload a number of players on either permanent or loan transfers before the January window closes as they aim to reduce their wage bill even further, with Sergino Dest and Martin Braithwaite among those being touted for exits. Tagliafico has spent the last four years of his career on Ajax's books, but GOAL can confirm that he wants to join Barca this month. He has rejected a number of other offers in favour of finalising a move to Camp Nou, but the two clubs now only have a week left to thrash out terms. Tagliafico could see more regular minutes at Barca after a frustrating start to the 2021-22 campaign that has seen him fall out of favour with Ajax boss Erik ten Hag. The Argentina international has started just six of the club's 29 games in all competitions with Daley Blind preferred at left-back, and he only has 18 months left to run on his current contract with no sign of an extension being offered.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-sign-ajax-left-back-tagliafico-close-january/blt2481603c51051ed1,GOAL,df3c019d-7ee5-47b5-901d-a61ec31669bf
Real Madrid confirm Hazard will undergo surgery on right leg injury,"Real Madrid attacker Eden Hazard will have an operation on his right leg, the club confirmed on Friday. The Belgium international has not featured for the Spanish side since he made a five-minute substitute appearance against Alaves on February 19. Hazard has been an unused substitute in each game since then and sat out the recent Clasico defeat to Barcelona. The 31-year-old will not be returning to action for the Santiago Bernabeu side any time soon, as Madrid confirmed he requires surgery. A statement on the club's website read: ""In the coming days, our player Eden Hazard will undergo surgery to remove the osteosynthesis plate in his right fibula."" Hazard has started just eight of the 21 matches in which he has featured for Carlo Ancelotti's team this season. The ex-Chelsea star's time in the Spanish capital has been plagued by injuries, limiting him to just 65 appearances since he joined the club in July 2019. GOAL reported this week that Madrid are looking to offload Hazard this summer as he is one of the club's highest-paid players. The club hope to strengthen in attack by bringing in Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland but will have to make space in the squad and wage budget.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-hazard-surgery-right-leg-injury/blte093587de11de94c,By Peter McVitie,744bd12e-c00b-4734-a7e4-1f71097223ac

'Nothing comes easy!' - Leeds boss Marsch on 'psychological battle' after incredible last-gasp goal keeps Premier League hopes alive,"Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch admits that ""nothing comes easy"" for his side after Pascal Struijk's injury-time finish snatched a dramatic point to lift them out of the relegation zone in the Premier League against Brighton. The Whites were forced to fight back for a share of the spoils against Graham Potter's Seagulls at Elland Road, nabbing a crucial result that - coupled with Burnley's defeat to Tottenham earlier in the day - moves them out of the bottom three. While the Clarets have a game in hand, the result nevertheless stokes hope of an unlikely great escape in West Yorkshire - but Marsch acknowledges his side seem to have a habit of inflicting tougher tests upon themselves. ""Our goal was to get three points today but we knew that any points and Burnley not getting any would shift the pressure a bit the other way,"" Marsch told Sky Sports News. ""We were unlucky not to come away with more. ""This is a psychological battle we are in. We need to show up next week and show us at our best. What you see is we are put in difficult situations and the resolve of our team. We need to be able to show that at the beginning of matches too. It is a fight.

We seem to dig holes and then have to find a way to dig out. We are ready. We are going to invest everything we have in this last match and see if we can do this. We need to stay strong with each other and not get frustrated."" With just one game left, destiny still remains out of the hands of the Whites - but with a point lifting them clear of the bottom three, the pressure is now all on Burnley. The Clarets have two matches remaining, against Aston Villa and Newcastle, while Leeds will face Brentford. In simple terms, a failure to take at least a point from either game relegates Mike Jackson's side, while two wins sends the Elland Road outfit down - and given the huge goal difference, just a draw could well be enough for the Turf Moor team too.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nothing-comes-easy-leeds-boss-marsch-on-psychological-battle/blt97d1f890359a9db4,Andrew Steel,45c391ff-fbf5-4f7b-85b3-bde10db6bfef
Watch: Man Utd flop Bebe scores stunning 30-yard free-kick for Rayo Vallecano in Copa del Rey semis,"Manchester United flop Bebe scored a stunning 30-yard free-kick for Rayo Vallecano in their Copa del Rey semi-final second leg with Real Betis. Bebe has played for 10 different clubs over the course of his career, including United, where he ultimately failed to break into the first-team squad between 2010 and 2014. The Portuguese forward has been on Rayo's books since 2018, and had appeared in 26 games for the club this season without scoring, only to break that streak in spectacular fashion at Benito Villamar√≠n Stadium. Rayo lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey tie 2-1 at home, but levelled the scoreline on aggregate in the 80th minute of the second as Bebe drove an unstoppable free-kick into the top-right hand corner from long range. Borja Iglesias broke the visitors' hearts with a stoppage-time equaliser to send Betis through to the final, but Bebe's strike will no doubt still live long in the memory of supporters and stand as a goal of the season contender.

Ronaldo slammed by Ten Hag for 'unacceptable' behaviour after leaving Manchester United friendly before full-time,"Erik ten Hag has slammed Cristiano Ronaldo for his ""unacceptable"" behaviour after seeing the striker leave Manchester United's final pre-season outing against Rayo Vallecano before the final whistle. Ronaldo returned to the Red Devils' starting XI for the clash at Old Trafford after an extended summer break, playing the first 45 minutes before being substituted for Amad Diallo. The 37-year-old was pictured leaving the stadium before full-time, and it was subsequently reported that he was joined by Diogo Dalot and a number of other players. Man Utd officials reportedly made it clear that they had no issue with Ronaldo and co heading home early, but Ten Hag has insisted that they did not have his permission. When quizzed on Ronaldo's conduct, the Dutchman told Viaplay Sport: ""Certainly not, that is unacceptable. For everyone.  I told them that it's unacceptable. That we are a team, a squad, and that you should stay until the end."" GOAL confirmed at the start of July that Ronaldo had informed the board of his desire to leave the club in order to continue playing Champions League football. The likes of Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich have all since been linked with the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, but his future remains very much up in the air heading into the Red Devils' Premier League opener against Brighton on Sunday. Cristiano Ronaldo is back in a Manchester United kit üëÄ pic.twitter.com/hobCnZNAHv United and Ten Hag have publicly insisted Ronaldo is not for sale, however speculation over a potential transfer remains ongoing and a return to Sporting CP is now being mooted. Ten Hag has been given advice on how to handle Ronaldo by former Man Utd assistant coach Chris Armas, who served under interim boss Ralf Rangnick in the second half of the 2021-22 season. The veteran forward scored 12 goals in 19 Premier League games while Armas was a member of the backroom staff, and the American believes one-on-one communication is the best way to bring the best out of him. ""It's a hands-on approach, speaking with him, bringing him into the office, asking him questions, so he's part of the solutions and part of the success,"" Armas told Sky Sports. ""It was my job to work out how to get all that fire, experience and talent and challenge him as much as I could. I think the most important thing is to engage with Cristiano. ""He's got so much to give, his commitment to winning and scoring, each guy has their different type of leadership. He can be a leader in his way, and my goal like everyone in the squad was to say how can I get the most out of Cristiano. ""When you talk about, at the highest level, seeing a professional and what winning means to Ronaldo, what scoring goals mean to him - he's on the team, a big part of the team and he's a guy who produced.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-slammed-by-ten-hag-unacceptable-behaviour-man-utd/blt527ab08fed9ab4b7,James Westwood,37c4492f-2597-4451-97db-0f6ccf6ee2ed
No Afcon postponement despite deadly stadium stampede - Caf,"The Confederation of African Football have rejected suggestions that the Africa Cup of Nations should be cancelled or postponed in light of Monday‚Äôs deadly stadium stampede at the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe which cost eight lives in the capital of Yaounde, and have insisted that the tournament can be a force for healing in Cameroon. A further 38 people were taken to hospital with injuries ‚Äî seven in a critical state ‚Äî during the Round of 16 meeting between the hosts and Comoros when a barrier collapsed and supporters were trampled by fans behind them attempting to enter the stadium. In light of the tragedy, Caf President Dr Patrice Motsepe has given some clarity on the circumstances surrounding the disaster, and outlined his belief that football can still have a positive impact in the Central African country. ‚ÄúThe issue was whether we should postpone [Tuesday‚Äôs] matches, and it‚Äôs an important question,‚Äù he told journalists. ‚ÄúFrom my side, I cannot just consult, but also listen to the guidance of various stakeholders. ‚ÄúThe conclusion was that we should observe a moment of silence, and with regards to [Tuesday‚Äôs] matches, it was an issue to discuss and consider. ‚ÄúHowever, it‚Äôs incredible how, even among those who are injured, two said to me that they can‚Äôt wait to get out of hospital and go to the stadium.  ""I‚Äôve seen the passion, the absolute passion of the people of Cameroon and their love for football; it brings people together, and the passion for football in this country is entrenched and deep-rooted.‚Äù Motsepe explained how his own experiences of watching sport in a fractured South Africa ‚Äî and South Africa‚Äôs 1995 rugby World Cup final victory ‚Äî fuelled his conviction that continuing with the tournament would be the best for all parties. ‚ÄúI come from a country separated on race, where blacks could not play football with whites, and we always knew the power of sport, of football,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI was in the stadium with my wife when [Nelson] Mandela was wearing the rugby captain‚Äôs jersey, and it had been the root of deep, deep division. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all dealing with the pain we feel, but we have to deal with our obligations, and we have to be aware of the role football plays in bringing together people from all backgrounds across the continent.‚Äù While Motsepe revealed that Caf would hold a meeting with the Cameroonian Organising Committee on Wednesday to get more clarity on the circumstances surrounding the stadium disaster, he believed that a closed gate‚Äîreported as being the East Entrance of the arena‚Äîled to the loss of life. ‚ÄúThere was a gate that was closed that was meant to be open, and if it had been open, people would have walked through,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúFor inexplicable reasons, it was closed. ‚ÄúIf it had been open, as it was supposed to, we wouldn‚Äôt have had the problem we have now‚Äîthis loss of life. ‚ÄúAs part of this hearing, we want to know who closed it and who is responsible, because we mustn‚Äôt compromise in our insistence to have appropriate measures which are the best in the world. ‚ÄúThere may be unforeseen circumstances when a gate that is supposed to be open is closed, but we and our partners, we have a huge commitment to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place so that this doesn‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù Motsepe also confirmed that Sunday‚Äôs fixture which was scheduled for Olembe ‚Äî between the winners of Egypt-Ivory Coast and the winners of Morocco-Malawi ‚Äî would now be moved to Olembe. They also revealed that the 30 January meeting between the winners of Senegal-Cape Verde and the winners of Mali-Equatorial Guinea would be moved to Limbe from Douala.

France national anthem: La Marseillaise lyrics in full and meaning explained,"France have been one of the most exciting teams to watch in recent times, with the sheer talent of their team earning a World Cup triumph in 2018. With Kylian Mbappe, N'Golo Kante, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele in their squad, expectations for Les Bleus are high. GOAL has what you need to know about their national anthem 'La Marseillaise' and more. 'La Marseillaise' is the French national anthem. It was composed in a single night in¬†1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg following the declaration of war against Austria by France. The mayor of Strasbourg decided the French troops needed an appropriate marching song, and Rouget de Lisle responded with 'La Marseillaise'. The song was originally titled 'Chant de guerre de l'armee du Rhin' (War Song of the Army of the Rhine'), but the anthem eventually became known as 'La Marseillaise' due to its popularity with volunteer troops from the French city of Marseille. The lyrics of 'La Marseillaise' evoke themes of defiance and strength, urging the French citizens to ""Marchons! Marchons!"", meaning¬†""let's march"". 'La Marseillaise' was sung by army troops from Marseilles as they travelled to Paris, and is a spirited anthem meant to be sung with passion and enthusiasm, inspiring¬†solidarity within the French people. Originally written as a war chant, the anthem has since served as a rallying cry and an opportunity for camaraderie and harmony. Both France supporters and England supporters sang a rousing rendition of 'La Marseillaise' at Wembley Stadium in November 2015 as a show of unity following the Paris attacks. It made for an emotional showing, with both sets of fans rarely coming together to sing a country's national anthem. ‚ÄúThere is a sense in which it is a very violent song, but people have taken it to mean the defense of freedom ‚Äì that is obviously what is in people‚Äôs minds today,‚Äù said David Andress, Professor of Modern History at University of Portsmouth, about the anthem. ‚ÄúMusic and song are very important cultural forces in generating cohesion. Whether it be national anthems, or religious music, or hymns, or folk songs, there is a very emotional, primal response to singing in union.‚Äù The original lyrics¬†to 'La Marseillaise'¬†had six verses, but only the first and sixth verses of the anthem are usually sung at public events. The text of these two verses are shown below, along with an accompanying English translation. Allons enfants de la Patrie,Le jour de gloire est arrive¬†!Contre nous de la tyrannieL'etendard sanglant est leve, (bis)Entendez-vous dans les campagnesMugir ces feroces soldats¬†?Ils viennent jusque dans vos brasEgorger vos fils, vos compagnes¬†!Aux armes, citoyens,Formez vos bataillons,Marchons, marchons¬†!Qu'un sang impurAbreuve nos sillons¬†!Que veut cette horde d'esclaves,De traitres, de rois conjures¬†?Pour qui ces ignobles entraves,Ces fers des longtemps prepares¬†?

Fall of the Roman empire: Abramovich's trophy-laden Chelsea tenure began and ended in controversy,"Roman Abramovich cemented legendary status at Chelsea after completing a clean sweep of trophies at the Club World Cup final in Abu Dhabi.¬† After walking onto the pitch at Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, he hugged manager Thomas Tuchel and chatted with Cesar Azpilicueta before lifting the trophy high above his head.¬† It was his 21st major honour in 19 years, during which time he secured Chelsea a seat at European football's top table, while also transforming the Blues into a global sports brand.¬† However, the accusations of close ties to the Kremlin never went away. He was always dogged by claims that he had used 'dirty money' to both buy and fund Chelsea. He never managed to outrun his past and eventually it got caught up with him, with Vladimir Putin's invasion of Russia prompting Abramovich to sell the club, meaning his reign began and ended amid controversy. When the news first broke on March 2, there was an emotional reaction from Chelsea's fanbase, who wanted to praise the main financier of two decades of sparkling success.¬† However, most of the info used by journalists to write about Abramovich during his time in west London came via off-the-record briefings or even hearsay in some cases.¬† Indeed, the Russian gave only one interview as Chelsea owner, and even that was with business publication Forbes.¬† ""In hindsight, especially given the public profile it would bring me, maybe I would have thought differently about owning a club,"" Abramovich said. ""But, at the time, I just saw this incredible game that I wanted to be a part of that in one way or another."" In reality, little is known about his motivation for owning the club. OFFICIAL: Roman Abramovich confirms he will sell Chelsea. pic.twitter.com/tKIWlENfGA His ¬£140 million ($187m) takeover, which also involved paying off an additional ¬£75m ($100m) in debt, saw him immediately go from a relatively unknown figure in the West ‚Äì outside of the steel industry ‚Äì to a world-famous oligarch.¬† In those early days, Abramovich was viewed by players at the club as an unassuming character who acted just like a supporter.¬† ""You would see Roman around at all the games and he gave a lot to Chelsea,"" former back-up goalkeeper Jurgen Macho told GOAL.¬† Midfielder Geremi added: ""You would meet him in the dressing room after matches or at the training ground.¬† ""He wasn‚Äôt really speaking much because I wasn‚Äôt sure how much English he could speak. ""He was a quiet and nice guy. He would talk to us through an interpreter. He seems like just a normal guy."" Of course, he was anything but. Abramovich changed football forever, paving the way for an internationally-minded group of billionaires to create a new world order within the game.¬† After all, if Abramovich's Chelsea were the first club to upset the old hierarchy. He arrived long before the Abu Dhabi-backed takeover of Manchester City or the Qatari-funded acquisition of Paris Saint-Germain. But all of those owners have since been accused of sportswashing and buying titles, the same accusations that were levelled at Abramovich when he turned the Premier League on its head. The way in which he went about snapping up top players during the summer of 2003 also arguably changed the entire nature of the transfer market, and how it was both covered by journalists, followed by players, exploited by agents and consumed by supporters. ""I was in my summer house then all of a sudden my dad asked me if I had seen the news: 'A Russian guy has brought the club,'"" former Chelsea winger Jesper Gronkjaer ‚Äì who scored the goal that played a key role in Abramovich's takeover ‚Äì told GOAL. ""As a player at the time, I had never experienced a change of owner before, so I didn‚Äôt expect anything big to happen. ""We soon found out this was for real and a lot of money would be put into the club. It was still the same place we had always trained in, so it didn‚Äôt feel too different.¬† ""But then we had to deal with the rumours around the manager because there were so many names brought into the picture who should take over. ""It also was about new players coming in for every position. I don‚Äôt think you would find a Chelsea player in that pre-season who wasn‚Äôt worried about their position at the club.¬† ""We were in a training camp in Italy, in a small town in the mountains. There was a cafe in the town where players could go. But it was full of agents and media.¬† ""You saw players sitting in corners talking to their agents asking what they should do because no one knew what would happen. ""Then, we went to Malaysia on tour, and I just remember players walking in and out, being bought and sold."" Abramovich's money didn't just attract world-class talent to Stamford Bridge; the ¬£1.5bn ($2bn) he invested also saw fans from all over the world flock to the stadium.¬† Chelsea FC became a truly global brand, with a state-of-the-art training ground, a wonderful academy and strong club culture. They perhaps still lack a ground worthy of such a sporting institution but that didn't stop a host of interested parties lining up to acquire the club from Abramovich, with a consortium fronted by Todd Boehly now set to complete their takeover in the coming days. What happens next remains to be seen, although GOAL has already shed some light on how the new owners plan to run the club. What's clear, though, is that no matter what one thinks of Abramovich, his tenure will be remembered for generations to come. He changed both Chelsea and football forever.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fall-roman-empire-abramovich-chelsea-tenure-began-ended/blt72dbdba8b4b3911f,Nizaar Kinsella,de58a2d2-2a19-4fd1-b4a5-32ac9a1eeef3
Arsenal's summer transfer plans revealed by Edu as Gunners target 'one or two' big-money signings,"Arsenal‚Äôs technical director, Edu, has revealed that the club are drawing up plans for the summer transfer window that will allow them to move for ‚Äúone or two players‚Äù that would help to raise collective standards. The Gunners have spent big in recent years, with 2021 seeing them snap up Martin Odegaard, Aaron Ramsdale, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Albert Sambi Lokonga. Mikel Arteta is now in the process of guiding that squad towards a potential top-four finish, and Champions League qualification would make it easier for the north London heavyweights to chase down the top targets that are currently being identified. Edu is of the opinion that Arsenal are now working with a competitive squad, as highlighted by victories over Chelsea and Manchester United in their last two games, with the plan being to make only minor alterations to Arteta‚Äôs ranks this summer. ‚ÄúThere was no point in hiring one or two players [in January], the squad was not prepared to absorb two players, we needed to rebalance the squad. Maybe next season we can go to one or two players,‚Äù former Gunners midfielder Edu told ESPN. ‚ÄúToday we find a much more balanced squad. Our planning has already been done, it has already reached the owners. It's a matter of step by step, how we are going to finish the season and to put in place the planning that I'm very excited about.‚Äù ‚àô Beats Chelsea ‚àô Beats Man Utd A good week for Arsenal‚Äôs top 4 race üèÜ pic.twitter.com/PLEt9A70ql A 3-1 victory over United in their latest outing has lifted Arsenal into fourth spot, two points clear of arch-rivals Tottenham with five games left to take in. Edu is hoping that European football will be back on the agenda for the Gunners next season, with it important for them to add depth to their squad if that proves to be the case. The Brazilian added: ‚ÄúThe Champions League and the Europa League both require a much larger squad because the amount of games is much bigger. ‚ÄúIf we can afford it financially and we don‚Äôt have to do the turnaround in the squad that we‚Äôve had to, what I want is 22 outfield players and three goalkeepers. ‚ÄúA lot of things have to be put in place and that takes time, so I am expecting a busy summer.‚Äù Who should Arsenal look to sign in the summer?

Man Utd dig up Aeroflot branding outside Old Trafford after separating from Russian airline,"Manchester United have had to dig up a part of the car park at Old Trafford to remove Aeroflot branding.  The club terminated their contract with the Russian airline last week after Russia invaded Ukraine and have had to remove the logo from the tarmac of one of the car parks at the ground.  Diggers were at the ground this week to remove the branding before new tarmac was laid to ensure all reference to the company couldn‚Äôt be seen.  The large Aeroflot branding was on the ground of the W1 car park at Old Trafford in front of the ticket office and after the club ended their nine-year partnership with the company last week they set about removing the logo.  Due to the surface being porous it was deemed too difficult to just paint over it and the decision was made to dig up a chunk of the car park and re-lay the tarmac instead.  The club confirmed they were terminating their partnership with the airline, which had been their ‚Äòofficial carrier‚Äô since 2013, last week.  In a statement, United said: ""In light of events in Ukraine, we have withdrawn Aeroflot's sponsorship right. We share the concerns of our fans around the world and extend our sympathies to those affected."" United renewed the deal in 2015, signing a five-year extension believed to be in the region of $40m (¬£29.9m).",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-dig-up-aeroflot-branding-outside-old-trafford-after/blt45a65fbe30aa9d33,Charlotte Duncker,640bbed5-b5d5-44ea-9fca-c94a285c2fcc
Vlahovic completes ‚Ç¨75m Juventus transfer after snubbing interest from Arsenal,"Dusan Vlahovic has completed his ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£62m/$84m) move from Fiorentina to Juventus, with the Serbian striker opting to snub interest from the Premier League in favour of Serie A. The 22-year-old had been heavily linked with a move to England once it became clear that he would not be extending his contract in Florence. Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester City were reported to have shown interest, however Juventus have won the race for a much sought-after signature. The agreement reached with Fiorentina sees Vlahovic head to Juve for a fee of ‚Ç¨70 million in cash, with which ‚Ç¨5 million in bonuses. That brings the number to the ‚Ç¨75million wanted by Fiorentina, with the striker's agent collecting around ‚Ç¨10 million for the deal. Vlahovic will be handed the No. 7 shirt at Juve and has signed a contract through 2026. The Serbian frontman has seen his stock soar over the course of the last 18 months, to the point that he quickly became one of the hottest properties in European football. Vlahovic registered 21 goals across all competitions for Fiorentina last season, and is already up to 20 in the current campaign. He is keeping pace with some illustrious names, such as Karim Benzema and Mohamed Salah, in the battle to chase down Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski in a thrilling Golden Shoe race. Juve will be hoping that he remains in that hunt when linking up with them, with the Bianconeri longing for inspiration in the final third of the field. They have been missing someone with the physical qualities of Vlahovic since allowing Cristiano Ronaldo to return to Manchester United in the summer of 2021.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/vlahovic-transfer-juventus-snubbing-interest-arsenal/blt9431bf3337f68118,Chris Burton,59f555eb-da42-4cd9-b7d5-1f41528c0630
'We're not playing FIFA 22 anymore!' - Neville says Pozuelo signing shows smarter Inter Miami strategy,"Phil Neville says the signing of Alejandro Pozuelo shows that Inter Miami have adopted a smarter transfer strategy, with the head coach insisting ""we're not playing FIFA 22 anymore"". Pozuelo was officially confirmed as an Inter Miami player on Thursday, with Toronto FC trading the Spaniard to the DRV PNK Stadium for ¬£150,000 ($200,000) in general allocation money. The Miami outfit have been accused of focusing too much on big names in the past, having brought in the likes of Blaise Matuidi and Gonzalo Higuain, but Neville believes that Pozuelo's arrival shows they are now heading in the right direction. The Inter Miami manager expressed his delight over the signing during his latest press conference, telling reporters: ""It's not just not playing FIFA 22 anymore. We're actually going through processes with people. A lot of hours, a lot of scouting, we're watching a lot of football, we're talking to a lot of people and we're bringing the right people and characters to the team. ""Certain players stand out when you're an opposition manager and he was one. I think about [Hany] Mukhtar, about Carles Gil, think about those levels of players that are game changers in this league. ""Pozuelo is that player. When you see the reaction of our players when they found out 24 hours ago, and you speak to some of the experienced players that played against him and they say, 'Well, that's the best player I've played against, the best player in the league, MVP of the league'.

""When this became a possibility for us, he fit our positional profiles, what we were looking for, It's one of those opportunities, Phil and I talk and the staff talks and we look at and see if it's the right choice for us and Alejandro was a player that fit for us. ""We were happy to get it over the finish line. Some of these deals are really difficult to do but at the end of the day, we're happy to get him."" Pozuelo will bring three years of experience in MLS with him to Inter Miami, who are currently sitting ninth in the Eastern Conference - four points ahead of his former club Toronto. Neville will hope that the 30-year-old can lift them towards the top of the table, having seen him record 26 goals and 31 assists in 88 appearances during his time at BMO Field.

Afcon 2021: Nigeria's Yobo questions 'harsh' Iwobi red card against Tunisia,"Coach Joseph Yobo claimed Alex Iwobi should not have been sent off for his challenge on Youssef Msakni during Nigeria‚Äôs 1-0 defeat to Tunisia in Sunday‚Äôs Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 fixture. With the Super Eagles trailing against the North Africans, the 25-year-old was thrown into the fray for Kelechi Iheanacho in the 59th minute. However, he was sent off seven minutes later for a needless challenge on the Carthage Eagles‚Äô captain. Iwobi was initially issued a caution, however, referee Maguette Ndiaye reversed his decision after checking VAR. Following the three-time African kings being reduced to 10 men, they struggled to impress and returned home with heads bowed low. That decision did not go well with Yobo, who stated that it ruined Nigeria‚Äôs chances of launching a comeback. ‚ÄúI went to the assistant referee and I asked him, and he said it was a collision. Fair enough, there was no intent to hurt anybody because it was in the middle of the park,‚Äù Yobo told GOAL in the mixed zone. ‚ÄúWe can look at it from different angles, but it was harsh in my own opinion ‚Äì a yellow card would have been fair. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen the replay, but the red card changed everything for us. Iwobi is a top player, and he could have added a lot of value to the team. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen the replay but with what I saw from the bench, the decision was a little bit harsh.‚Äù Having failed in their expedition to win a fourth African title, Nigeria will now shift their focus on the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifying play-off against Ghana. The former Super Eagles captain is hoping his players recover from their disappointment to face the Black Stars en route to qualifying for the global football showpiece in Qatar. ‚ÄúIt is for the boys and for everybody to recover from it and shift attention to Ghana, but everyone is really disappointed,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe gave so much of a good account of ourselves in the group stage and made Nigerians and everyone believe in our football again. So, to lose out in this way really hurts. ‚ÄúI just wished we had 11 players till the end of the game, it would have been a different outcome.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-nigeria-yobo-questions-harsh-iwobi-red-card/blt3596d887ee7d5a7a,Shina Oludare,da99dc82-b791-48af-a67c-e34e02d70f1a
Ten Hag backed to get best out of Maguire by former Man Utd defender Stam,"Former Manchester United star Jaap Stam believes that Harry Maguire can turn around his fortunes at Old Trafford under the guidance of incoming manager Erik ten Hag.  Maguire, 29, has come under fire for his performances during a disappointing season for the Red Devils in 2021-22.  But he remains United's captain, and Stam claims that the Ajax coach's arrival could mark a turning point for the centre-back. ""I still think that Harry is a good player. He is a good defender,"" the former United and Netherlands defender told PA. ""You need to understand that every player - and I've had it myself - goes through rough spells that he's having and hard times, the confidence is a bit low, he's not feeling well and making mistakes. So when you cost ¬£100m and you are making a mistake, yeah, the pressure on you is a lot more than when you're costing a few quid. ""He's played this season good games as well. Having this season now and maybe a new coach coming in, having a fresh start, learning a lot from this season as well and what he's done and what he needs to do. ""Does he need to make a change or not? Maybe having different players next to him or in front of him can help him out as well in terms of feeling more confident, so maybe next season you'll see a total different player."" Maguire became the world's most expensive defender in 2019 when he joined United from Leicester City in a deal believed to be worth ¬£80¬†million. He made a strong start at the club and just months after signing was installed as the club captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a position he has held ever since.  In 2021-22, however, Maguire has found himself under pressure as he has taken much of the blame for the Reds' subpar displays.  The club has conceded 52 goals in their 36 Premier League outings so far, up from 44 the previous term; though the biggest fall-off has been in attack, despite the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, where their goal tally has fallen from 73 to just 57 this season.  United currently occupy sixth place in the league standings, a position that would see them play in the Conference League in 2022-23.

Borussia Dortmund confirm Reyna's season is over as USMNT star injures muscle & tendon,"Borussia Dortmund have confirmed that Giovanni Reyna has suffered a muscle and tendon injury that will prevent him from playing again this season. Reyna has missed over 100 days of the 2021-22 campaign due to injury, featuring in just 13 games across all competitions as a result. The 19-year-old started in BVB's latest Bundesliga outing against Stuttgart on Friday, having only just returned from a serious hamstring issue, but only lasted six minutes before limping off. Reyna was moved to tears and had to be consoled by his team-mates as he made his way towards the tunnel, with Dortmund going on to win the match 2-0 in his absence.

Osimhen scores landmark Serie A goals in Napoli's comeback win,"Napoli striker Victor Osimhen has become the first Nigerian player to hit double figures in two different Serie A seasons with his brace on Saturday. Osimhen helped Luciano Spalletti's side come from behind with two second-half goals that steered them to a 2-1 victory over Udinese. The brace took the 23-year-old's league tally to 11 goals after 20 league appearances so far in this campaign. After Gerard Deulofeu's opening goal for Udinese in the first-half, Osimhen inspired his team's fight-back with a header off Mario Rui's cross in the 52nd minute. The Nigeria star turned up again to put the Partenopeans ahead with his second goal, three minutes after the hour-mark. It was his third brace in the Italian top-flight this term and he has now achieved a feat former Nigeria stars like Obafemi Martins, Nwankwo Kanu, Ayo Makinwa and Obinna Nsofor never did in Serie A. Since he moved to the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona from Lille in August 2020, he has scored 21 goals in 44 Serie A games. Osimhen played the entire duration for Napoli alongside Cameroon midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly. The victory boosted the Partenopeans' Serie A title chances as they leapfrogged AC Milan by goal difference, though the Rossoneri have a game in hand. Napoli have 63 points after 30 matches and their next league outing is against Atalanta after the international break. After scoring four goals in his last two matches, Osimhen's form comes as good news for Nigeria ahead of their 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifying match against Ghana on March 25 and 29.

USWNT legend Lloyd says she was more nervous doing the 2022 World Cup draw than when playing in a World Cup final,"United States women's team legend Carli Lloyd was more intimidated by performing the draw for the 2022 men's World Cup than playing in the women's tournament's final. The former midfielder was involved in the process as the teams competing at this year's tournament learned who they would come up against in the group stage in Qatar this year. Lloyd played in three World Cup finals as a player and went on to win two of them, but determining the fate of this year's teams proved nerve-wracking for her.

Dessers scores twice as Feyenoord come from behind to slow PSV's Eredivisie ambitions,"Cyriel Dessers scored twice as Feyenoord came from behind to dent PSV Eindhoven's title hopes following a 2-2 draw in Rotterdam on Sunday. PSV had taken an early 2-0 lead when Cody Gakpo scored a brace with goals in the 16th and 29th minutes and looked on course to take advantage of leaders Ajax Amsterdam's 2-2 draw with AZ Alkmaar earlier, but the Nigerian international had other ideas. Hosts Feyenoord upped the game after the break and Dessers fired the first a warning in the 65th minute when he went past multiple challenges before forcing a great save from PSV goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo. PSV held onto their lead until the 86th minute when Dessers popped up with a header, connecting well with an excellent cross to reduce the arrears. With four minutes added on, German midfielder Mario Gotze handled the ball in the box, handing Feyenoord a lifeline via the spot. Dessers stepped up and made no mistakes, sending Mvogo the wrong way to slot into the left-hand side for a 2-2 full-time score that dents PSV's title chances as they stay second on the table with 75 points, four behind Ajax with two games remaining. Meanwhile, Sebastien Haller missed from close range as Ajax also came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw away to AZ Alkmaar. The Ivorian striker played 90 minutes as the Dutch champions sought victory to extend their lead over second-placed PSV and managed four shots while winning two aerial duels. Brian Brobbey had given the visitors the lead in the 42nd minute before the hosts responded after the break, Vangelis Pavlidis levelling from a close-range header in the 62nd minute before Hakon Evjen took advantage of some poor defending from Ajax to extend the lead 15 minutes from time. With Ajax chasing an equaliser, Haller received the ball in the box but squandered the opportunity when he fired straight at the goalkeeper. However, Erik ten Hag‚Äôs men rescued a point when Edson Alvarez headed in Steven Berghuis‚Äô perfectly taken corner with four minutes remaining. Before the second goal, Ten Hag had brought on Moroccan Noussair Mazraoui in place of Devyne Rensch with Ghana attacker Mohammed Kudus also a late substitute for Daley Blind, who had been at fault for AZ Alkmaar‚Äôs second goal. Both Mazraoui and Kudus looked lively as Ajax laid siege on their opponent‚Äôs goal in the final 10 minutes but the home side withstood the pressure to claim the draw. Ajax are now just one win away from retaining their title and can do that on Wednesday when they host Heerenveen.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dessers-scored-twice-as-feyenoord-come-from-behind-to-slow/blt1ed2440706e79915,Joel Omotto,10e49796-7634-4e92-af4f-76d06297ed3f
Salisu: Ghana World Cup legend Asamoah Gyan backs Southampton star's call-up,"Legendary Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan would welcome Southampton defender Mohammed Salisu into the Black Stars set-up ahead of the World Cup should the centre-back avail himself for national duty. The 22-year-old, who has refused to play for Ghana, has become a major subject of discussion, particularly following the Black Stars‚Äô qualification for the global showpiece.  Although he has turned down invitations to the national team so far, there have been reports that the World Cup qualification is likely to soften his stand. However, a section of Ghana fans have questioned the player‚Äôs level of commitment to the country and if he deserves a place in the squad to Qatar. ‚ÄúWhy not, he is not only the best defender in the Premiership, but the Premiership is also the best league in the world,‚Äù Gyan said on Peace FM when asked whether the Southampton man should be considered for the World Cup. ‚ÄúIf he is rated among the top three defenders, definitely he is eligible to play for the national team if only he is in the plans of the coach and he [Salisu] has it in mind to play [for the country]. ‚ÄúDefinitely, he should be ready for the national team, but it will depend on him and the technical team.‚Äù Ahead of their World Cup qualifying play-off clash with Nigeria last month, Ghana caretaker boss Otto Addo held another meeting with Salisu with the intention to convince the defender to change his mind. The centre-back, however, rejected the call one more time. ‚ÄúI watch him as a fan because he is doing well at Southampton,‚Äù Gyan added. ‚ÄúI think he is one of the top three defenders in the Premier League and he being a Ghanaian, I think he is selling the country.  ‚ÄúHe is performing well but I don‚Äôt know if he wants to play for the national team.‚Äù Salisu has been hailed as one of the best defenders in the Premier League this season, as he currently stands as the player with the most interceptions so far.

FIFA sends first-aid kits and pledges $1m to aid humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,"FIFA have sent a shipment of humanitarian supplies and pledged $1 million in funds to support Ukraine amid the nation's invasion by Russia. As the crisis in Eastern Europe grows closer to the one-month mark, football's governing body has revealed that it has been providing aid. That includes a hefty monetary sum to the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF), which has been allocated to help those in need. In a statement, FIFA President Gianni Infantino pledged the organisation's further support to Ukraine amid the ongoing crisis, stating that they would aim to do what they could alongside their domestic compatriots.

'Almost broke his leg' - Lage and Neves slam referee as Schar escapes red in Wolves draw against Newcastle,"WHAT HAPPENED? Wolves conceded a stoppage-time equaliser to an Allan Saint-Maximin wonder strike as Lage's side remain winless in the Premier League this season. Wolves felt aggrieved they were not awarded a penalty and also felt hard done by when they had a second goal chalked off from Raul Jimenez on a disappointing afternoon.  WHAT THEY SAID: On Schar's challenge on Pedro Neto, Lage said: ""Ninety percent of the people after watching the image would say it's a red card. But the referee and the VAR take another decision. It should be a red card in my opinion."" Speaking to Sky Sports, Neves said: ""At the end it is details. Maybe a detail when Neto almost broke his leg and the ref didn't run to the screen, that is one detail. Another detail is we score a second goal and the ref run to the screen. A lot of meetings before the season starts every-time, but then when you see our player almost breaking their leg from that tackle, and the ref doesn't go to the screen, we ask why we do so many meetings.""

'You couldn't sleep a wink' - Shakhtar coach Bianco tells of fearful escape from Ukraine amid concern for former colleagues,"Former Serie A player and current Shakhtar Donetsk coach Paolo Bianco opened up on his escape from Ukraine, revealing how he left Kyiv by train as bombings were in progress. Bianco was in Ukraine as a member of Roberto De Zerbi technical staff and, in the wake of Russia's invasion of the country, the former Atalanta and Sassuolo player had to escape the country. The coach credits the club as well as former Shakhtar star and current director of football Darijo Srna¬†for their assistance as he says they were unable to receive help from the Italian government during the invasion. Biano says that he and the coaching staff had turned to Italy as the invasion began, but the Italian government could do little other than tell the coaches to leave Ukraine in advance.  And so Srna and the club contacted the Ukrainian FA, who helped Bianco and co. escape to Hungary.  Before that, though, they were stranded in a hotel with Bianco explaining the fear that came with being trapped in a country at war. ""During the days we were preparing for what could be the eventual entrance into the city of the Russians,"" Bianco told GOAL. ""OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) representatives and some journalists told us to be ready to show our Italian passport and the Italian flag ... hands on, look down, do not challenge them ... so we waited for such a moment. And obviously you couldn't sleep a wink at night. The days were spent organizing an eventual escape."" He continued: ""When we were able to leave the hotel I had a sense of freedom that I had never experienced in my life. Being closed for days in a basement with people you don't know, without knowing anything after a while leads you to no longer have not even fear, anguish. ""We left Kiev by train but the journey lasted nine and a half hours and, in some cases, the train proceeded in the dark because on some lines there were bombings in progress."" Bianco revealed that several members of the Shakhtar staff remain in Ukraine and that there is concern over their safety. ""Some of the guys from the staff and some players are still in Ukraine,"" he said. ""So every morning we contact them hoping for their response and we are very worried about them."" The coach says he is unsure if he will ever be able to return to the club given the events of the last few days, but he does hope to someday return to a peaceful Ukraine to reunite with those that he has become close to during his time there. ""I don't know if I still see myself in that club because I don't even know if football is going on,"" he said, ""but I certainly see myself with those same people. ""I want to go back to Ukraine to hug everyone again. This experience will unite us forever.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/you-couldn-t-sleep-a-wink-shakhtar-coach-bianco-tells-of-fearful-/bltb366b2b97ecda375,Renato Maisani,cc480ade-57de-420d-8a2a-27035c8bd565
Real Madrid make permanent ¬£5.5m Kubo sale to Real Sociedad but retain sell-on rights,"By Antonio Vazquez - Real Madrid will sell Japan youngster Takefusa Kubo to La Liga rivals Real Sociedad, the clubs confirmed on Monday. Kubo moves to San Sebastian in a deal worth ‚Ç¨6.5 million (¬£5.5m/$6.5m), while Madrid retain a portion of the winger's playing rights.  Kubo, 21, is highly rated in Spain but found first-team opportunities hard to come by among Madrid's star-studded squad.  He will now look to feature on a more regular basis for Sociedad, who will be active both in the Primera Division and Europa League over the course of 2022-23.

""The Japanese footballer will undergo a medical tomorrow at the Gipuzkoa Polyclinic and once completed, will sign his contract with Real and be officially presented as a new Txuri Urdin player.""  GOAL understands that Real have purchased 50 per cent of Kubo's playing rights in exchange for a fee of ¬£5.5m.  Madrid remain in control of the other half, which can be sold at a later date should the club so wish.  Kubo first arrived at Madrid from FC Tokyo at the age of 18, having previously spent three seasons in the academy arch-rivals Barcelona before being forced to leave due to a breach of FIFA underage transfer restrictions. He did not play a single game at senior level for the Merengue but has accrued first-team experience away from the club in a series of loan moves, the most recent of which at Mallorca where he played 31 games in all competitions across 2021-22, scoring on three occasions.

Everton left-back Mykolenko calls out 'sh*thead' Russian footballers for staying silent amid Ukraine invasion,"Everton left-back Vitaliy Mykolenko has called out ""sh*thead"" Russian footballers, criticising those that have stayed silent amid their country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Mykolenko, who represents Ukraine at international level, moved to Everton from Dynamo Kiev in January and made headlines after embracing his compatriot Oleksandr Zinchenko before the Toffees' defeat to Manchester City on February 26. The football community in England has united to pledge their support towards Ukraine as Russian military forces continue to invade the country, but Mykolenko feels Russian stars have been inexcusably quiet. The 22-year-old has taken to social media to launch a foul-mouthed rant against the Russian football team, who have been suspended from competing by FIFA and UEFA due to the crisis in Ukraine. In a post that tagged Russian player Artem Dzyuba, Mykolenko wrote: ""Whilst you remain silent, b*itch, along with your sh*thead football teammates, peaceful civilians are being killed in Ukraine. ‚ÄúYou will be locked in your dungeon for the rest of your life and most importantly the lives of your kids.

Usmanov is not officially part of the day-to-day running of the Toffees, but his private Russian holding company USM sponsors the club's training ground. Megafon, another of Usmanov's firms, is the main shirt sponsor of the Everton women's team, and Labour MP Chris Bryant has urged the club to distance itself from him.

The 10 most expensive British transfers of all time,"Any side competing on a Premier League stage is richly rewarded for said standing, with money in the bank allowing elaborate spending to take place on big-money transfers. English top-flight outfits have invested heavily down the years, as billionaire owners and lucrative broadcasting deals become commonplace, with the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United often leading the way. Who, though, have formed part of the most expensive deals in British football history? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ When a Premier League era was ushered in during the summer of 1992, Alan Shearer had just become the most expensive player in Britain when completing a ¬£3.75 million ($5m) move from Southampton to Blackburn. That record-breaking bar was raised on a regular basis in the years that followed, from Roy Keane to Chris Sutton and Andy Cole, before Shearer made history again when returning to his roots at Newcastle for ¬£15m ($18m) in 1996. Manchester United would go on to spend big when landing Ruud van Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastian Veron and Rio Ferdinand, while Andriy Shevchenko and Robinho were the first to break through the ¬£30m ($36m) barrier when joining Chelsea and Manchester City respectively. Fees rose at a remarkable rate from there, with Fernando Torres joining Chelsea for ¬£50m ($60m) in January 2011, but none of those deals figure in a current top 10 that is filled by transfers from a six-year window stretching back to 2016. Paul Pogba rejoined Manchester United that summer from Juventus for ¬£89m ($107m), but that agreement has since been passed by Romelu Lukaku as he retraced steps to Chelsea and Jack Grealish‚Äôs stunning ¬£100m ($120m) switch to Manchester City ‚Äì while the most expensive defender (Harry Maguire) and goalkeeper (Kepa Arrizabalaga) in world football also ply their trade in the Premier League.

Kalvin Phillips has become the latest addition to that list after making a ¬£45m ($54m) switch from Leeds to Manchester City. The reigning Premier League champions fill four of the berths inside a notable top 10, with considerable faith and funds invested in Raheem Sterling, John Stones and Kyle Walker. Arsenal and Chelsea have splashed out on international defenders, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka at Manchester United is the only man without a Three Lions cap to his name to figure on the chart ‚Äì and he could switch allegiance to Congo amid fierce competition for right-back berths in Gareth Southgate‚Äôs plans.

"First Coutinho, now Wijnaldum - Why leaving Liverpool has become a dangerous move","This is not how Gini Wijnaldum pictured it in his head. Five months into his Paris Saint-Germain career, the Netherlands international finds himself with a fight on his hands.¬† For his place, for acceptance and recognition and, perhaps, for his future too. If recent reports are to be believed, then PSG may already be willing to let the 31-year-old leave.  Wijnaldum, apparently, has not settled in the French capital, has not been particularly welcomed by his team-mates and would be open to a move, in particular a return to the Premier League. What a strange state of affairs. This had looked like the ideal move for all parties when it was confirmed back in June, but now Wijnaldum finds himself being linked with a loan switch to Arsenal or West Ham or Newcastle.¬† How quickly the world turns, eh? The perils of leaving Liverpool, you might say.  Like Philippe Coutinho before him, Wijnaldum has discovered that the grass isn‚Äôt always greener. Life after Anfield, it seems, can be tough, even for the best and the most dedicated. Wijnaldum left the Reds a hero, a Champions League winner and a Premier League champion. He was the ultimate team player, versatile and durable, prepared to play in attack and defence as well as midfield.  He scored big goals and played in big games. In five years on Merseyside, in fact, he played in more games than anybody else. There were 237 of them in total, a staggering figure for a modern-day midfielder. Life has been different in Paris, where Wijnaldum has so far started only 11 times and made 10 substitute appearances.  ‚ÄúVery difficult,‚Äù he admitted back in October, revealing that ‚Äúthe situation is not what I wanted.‚Äù PSG may be romping away with Ligue 1, and have a Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid to look forward to in the New Year, but life is far from perfect at Parc des Princes.  Mauricio Pochettino is under pressure ‚Äì himself linked strongly with a return to England ‚Äì and his team, for all its dazzling individual quality, looks imbalanced and lacks cohesion.¬† They win games because of their talent, but the feeling is that they will come unstuck against better opponents, particularly in the knockout stages of the Champions League. That‚Äôs the true cost of having a forward line of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi, you might say.¬† Wijnaldum, you would have thought, would have helped in that regard, given his ability to sacrifice himself for the good of the team.  But while there have been flashes of late ‚Äì two goals against RB Leipzig, for example, and a last-minute equaliser at Lens ‚Äì the general consensus is that his performances have been below the standard expected. He has been criticised, in particular, for playing too safe with his passing, and for not taking enough responsibility in building the game up.  Observers also say he has looked sluggish, both on and off the ball, and there have been moments where his team-mates ‚Äì Messi and Mbappe, in particular ‚Äì have openly expressed frustration. Rather unfairly, it has been suggested that the dressing room, generally, is yet to accept him.  Wijnaldum was a big character at Liverpool, one of the club‚Äôs four captains under Klopp before his departure, but he has found PSG a little more cliquey and a little less welcoming. And certainly, he is yet to feel the love from the supporters. Maybe there is a lesson there, given the interview Wijnaldum gave following his Anfield exit.  In it, he complained that he didn‚Äôt always feel ‚Äúloved and appreciated‚Äù by Liverpool fans, particularly those venting their spleen on social media.¬† ‚ÄúIf we lost, I was the one who got the blame,‚Äù he claimed, though the reception he got from 10,000 Reds fans after his final game for the club, against Crystal Palace in May, suggests his critics were in the minority. Certainly, Klopp and his team-mates knew his value. There were plenty of tears on his last day. He wanted to stay at Liverpool, but felt the club didn‚Äôt value him as much as they ought to have.  Negotiations over a new deal broke down and were not resumed, and he saw out his contract in difficult circumstances, captaining an injury-hit side in behind-closed-doors games as the 2019-20 champions struggled to sneak a top-four finish in the following campaign. PSG looked, on paper at least, an ideal move. Certainly better than Barcelona, where he was originally expected to end up.  Wijnaldum, selfless and consistent, looked the ideal player to help balance Pochettino‚Äôs side, providing nous and reliability, as well as top-level experience. He still can, of course. PSG will win Ligue 1 and are capable of winning the Champions League too, for sure. Wijnaldum may still have a role to play, even if it won‚Äôt be as integral as the one he had on Merseyside. His experience, and that of Coutinho, should serve as a warning, however, to those considering a future beyond Liverpool.¬† Do so at your own risk. After Anfield, these days the only way is down.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/coutinho-wijnaldum-leaving-liverpool-a-dangerous-move/bltccbf2253c698aa7a,Neil Jones,e88de63e-e4cd-4af9-b509-a48f7c0dbd23
Sterling back in the groove for Guardiola and Man City as Atletico Madrid and Liverpool loom,"‚ÄúRaheem Sterling, he‚Äôs top of the league!‚Äù It is a signature chant that was attached to the Manchester City forward after he first moved to the Etihad Stadium, when Liverpool fans were questioning the motives behind his acrimonious transfer in the summer of 2015. Seven years, and three Premier League winners‚Äô medals down the line, that song has stuck and got a lively rendition from the away fans following City‚Äôs 2-0 victory over relegation-threatened Burnley on Saturday. Partly, the reason was that Liverpool were briefly back on top of the Premier League table for the first time in six months following their lunchtime victory over Watford. Officially, City were in second spot for close to two-and-a-half hours, but in reality it was less than 30 minutes after City put in the storming response that Pep Guardiola will have demanded. Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne combined brilliantly for a fifth-minute opener and, from then on, any hope of Liverpool carrying their title advantage into next week‚Äôs clash between the two clubs was effectively vanquished. Jurgen Klopp could not even be asked questions about the possibility, and joked about it in his post-match press conference that began after City had taken the lead. There had never been any real danger of City taking the trip to Turf Moor lightly, even if Burnley are mired in a relegation battle, with Guardiola's side facing the daunting prospect of facing both Atletico Madrid and Liverpool twice in their next four matches. Players like Sterling and De Bruyne have been here before and know exactly what is required, which is why the City boss can rely on them. For Sterling, it is a slightly different scenario, with the England international fighting for his starting place more than ever. Recently, he has often come off second best against record signing Jack Grealish and leading goalscorer Riyad Mahrez, with Gabriel Jesus and, occasionally, Phil Foden battling for the same spots. He was on the bench for the Manchester derby and goalless draw with Crystal Palace before the international break, but back in the side at Turf Moor, he took his chance to show his form ahead of those massive games. For England in midweek, he showed his quality with a goal and assist as captain in the 3-0 victory over Ivory Coast, and then underlined it as the star man at Burnley. The touch for De Bruyne‚Äôs opening strike was sumptuous, the pass for Ilkay Gundogan‚Äôs second was perfect. He could have had a hat-trick of assists when his brilliant shimmy and cross picked out Jesus, who narrowly volleyed over. He also scuffed a volleyed lob which would have rounded off another unstoppable move of effortless precision. It has put Sterling in the frame to start City‚Äôs Champions League quarter-final first leg against Atletico, even with Mahrez likely to come back in, with Guardiola believing he is back in his groove. ‚ÄúAll the time when Raheem comes back from the national team he comes back with a boost,‚Äù the City boss said. ‚ÄúIt was incredible that he was captain and you see how decisive he was in all the actions and his assists and he creates one-twos on the right side. I have a feeling he's arriving in a really good moment.‚Äù Guardiola rotated his squad with tougher games to come, leaving out John Stones, who was not 100 per cent fit, and resting Bernardo Silva. And the City boss has insisted he will need each member of his squad if they are to finish the season with silverware. ‚ÄúEveryone made their own contribution and we got the points,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEight games left, 24 points - we spoke about that. We have to feel the pressure that every game we play if we lose we are not going to win, we will be out. ‚ÄúHopefully Liverpool will lose against us but apart from that I don't think they will drop points. We have to feel this pressure and handle it. We did it in the past. We won 14 games in a row, now we have to win eight games, otherwise we will not be champions.""

U.S. Soccer Federation reaches 'historic' equal pay agreement with both men & women's national teams,"The United States men's and women's national teams have reached historic collective bargaining agreements (CBA) with the United States Soccer Federation (USSF). The agreements equalise pay from all competition appearances for both teams as well as equality in the sharing of commercial revenue. The agreements between the USSF, the women's players union (USWNTPA) and men's union (USNSTPA) will run until 2028. USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone hailed the agreement as a game-changer for the whole world. ""This is a truly historic moment. These agreements have changed the game forever here in the United States and have the potential to change the game around the world,"" said Cone.  ""U.S. Soccer and the USWNT and USMNT players have reset their relationship with these new agreements and are leading us forward to an incredibly exciting new phase of mutual growth and collaboration as we continue our mission to become the preeminent sport in the United States."" USWNTPA president Becky Sauerbrunn said: ""The accomplishments in this CBA are a testament to the incredible efforts of WNT players on and off the field.  ""The gains we have been able to achieve are both because of the strong foundation laid by the generations of WNT players that came before the current team and through our union‚Äôs recent collaboration with our counterparts at the USNSTPA and leadership at U.S. Soccer. We hope that this agreement and its historic achievements in not only providing for equal pay but also in improving the training and playing environment for national team players will similarly serve as the foundation for continued growth of women‚Äôs soccer both in the United States and abroad."" Among other things, the CBAs will ""provide for equal rates of pay"" for the senior national team. ""For friendly games, players on the USWNT and USMNT will be paid identical roster appearance fees and performance payments, based on the outcome of the match and the rank of the opponent, with identical tiering structures,"" the announcement declared. The players' unions will also ""pool and share a portion of prize money paid for the teams‚Äô participation in the 2022 men‚Äôs World Cup and the 2023 women‚Äôs World Cup.  ""In this arrangement, the players on the 2022 MWC roster and on the 2023 WWC roster will be paid an equal percentage of the collective prize money paid by FIFA for the teams‚Äô participation and performance in their respective World Cups. The same will occur with the 2026 MWC and the 2027 MWC."" Furthermore, the CBAs improve terms for ""player health and safety, data privacy and the need to balance responsibilities to both club and country"", with the USSF providing child care during training camps and matches and introducing retirement plans. The USWNT players have given up fixed contracts in order to guarantee equal pay with the men's team. Surrendering the contracts may be a big sacrifice as those who are not part of the squad will no longer be paid, but it allows the players to earn more money. In the qualifying matches for the 2023 World Cup, USWNT players will earn $10,000 per game, plus $14,000 per victory. Midge Purce, who was a member of the USWNTPA bargaining team, told The Equalizer: ‚ÄúI think we progressed.  ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve outgrown some of the conditions that may look like we have lost something. But no, rather, our league is actually strong enough where now we don‚Äôt need as many guaranteed contracts. We can be on more of a pay-to-play model. No, I don‚Äôt [think we gave up a lot]. I think we did a fantastic job negotiating this CBA and we‚Äôre all very proud of it.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/u-s-soccer-federation-historic-equal-pay-agreement-men-women/blt4267a0200fca588b,Peter McVitie,0aa94166-ca61-4f37-9e91-48f74e54273d

"Dortmund need Reyna back, says Kehl, as USMNT star takes part in training after injury","Borussia Dortmund director Sebastian Kehl revealed that Giovanni Reyna is taking a bigger part in team training, while affirming that the club cannot wait to welcome the USMNT star back following injury.  Reyna has been unavailable since September, when he picked up a hamstring injury on international duty.  The teenager's absence has been felt keenly by BVB, who went out of the Champions League at the group stage and have fallen behind Bayern Munich in the race for the Bundesliga. ‚ÄúGio had a good early phase this season, he played outstanding games in the diamond,"" Kehl explained in an interview published on Dortmund's official website. ""He moves cleverly between the lines, but also pulls from the outside in, radiates a goal danger and carries a shrewdness in himself.¬†We want him back again.¬† ""It was a difficult phase for him, but he's stable again.¬†He takes part in parts of the training, that will increase over the next few days.¬† ""The boys need that, they want to play football and have fun.""¬† The son of former Premier League and USMNT star Claudio Reyna, Gio began his youth career in New York City FC's academy before moving to Dortmund in 2019.  He made his first-team debut the following year at the age of just 17 and has been an established part of the BVB set-up ever since, racking up 69 appearances and 10 goals in all competitions to date.  Reyna had begun the 2021-22season in fine form, netting twice in Dortmund's opening three Bundesliga games before injury left him on the sidelines.  The initial prognosis was positive, but in November Marco Rose admitted that the muscle problem was more complicated than first believed.  ¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs slowly getting better,"" the coach signalled. ‚ÄúThe injury turned out to be a bit more serious than we expected. ‚ÄúIt is not possible for me to predict when he will be back in team training.

"Wembley: England's stadium capacity, location, facts & video tour","The largest ground in the UK and the second largest in Europe, Wembley stadium was built for the big occasion. Wembley has hosted countless memorable occasions, including the Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona in 2011 and the European Championship men's and women's finals in 2021 and 2022. So if you are planning a visit to the home of the England men's and women's national teams, GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Address: Wembley, London HA9 0WS Google maps: Further directions to the stadium can be found here Wembley Stadium is located in the north-western region of London. The stadium is best accessed via train: Wembley Park train station is a five-minute walk from the stadium and can be reached on the Jubilee and Metropolitan Underground lines. Wembley Central train station, which is accessible via the Bakerloo line and the London Overground metro, is also a 10 to 15-minute walk from the stadium. Another nearby access point is Wembley Stadium train station, which can be reached via the overground Chiltern Railways. Local buses 18, 83, 92, and 224 all stop within walking distance of Wembley Stadium. The stadium can be reached by car via the A406, which can be accessed from the M1. Once on the A406, road signs will direct you to the stadium. To get to the stadium by car from central London, take the A404 Harrow road, which is accessible from the A40. When you reach Wembley Rail Station on Harrow Road, turn right onto Wembley Hill Road, and follow the road signs to ground. On May 19, 2007, Chelsea and Manchester United competed in the FA Cup final to mark Wembley Stadium's opening ceremony, in a match which saw the London club lift the trophy in a 1-0 win. It wasn't the first game to be played at the new venue, however, with England U-21's fixture against Italy, that ended in a 3-3 draw, having that honour. The old Wembley Stadium, originally built in 1923, was torn down in 2003, and construction on the brand new Wembley started on the same site. The new Wembley Stadium was completed and prepared to open in 2007 after a number of delays and postponements, caused by unforeseen costs and construction complications. Foster & Partners and Populous were the architecture firms who designed the new stadium, which is estimated to have cost a total of ¬£757 million ($916m), or a staggering ¬£1.27 billion ($1.53bn) in today's money. The most recognisable feature of Wembley stadium is its grand 133-metre tall arch, which spans over 315 metres, making it the longest single span roof structure in the world. Wembley Stadium also has a sliding roof located 52 metres above the pitch. The roof does not fully shut but it still manages to cover every seat in the stadium, which makes Wembley the largest fully covered stadium in the world. Wembley Stadium has a capacity of 90,000, which can be increased for particular events. Wembley Stadium is not used on a regular basis by any club football side, but it is the home of England's men's and women's national football teams. However, between 2017 and 2019, it did host all of Tottenham's home matches while they were constructing their new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Wembley also stages several domestic cup finals including the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup, the Women's FA Cup, in addition to the National League and EFL play-off finals. The Community Shield is also traditionally played at Wembley, although in 2022 Leicester City's King Power Stadium hosted Liverpool's win over Manchester City, due to the women's Euro 2022 final being played at Wembley the day after. As Wembley isn‚Äôt in constant use for football purposes, it does accommodate a wide range of events, including concerts, boxing, rugby and American football. The artists who have performed at Wembley Stadium include Coldplay, Madonna, Eminem, Ed Sheeran and One Direction. In 2017, Adele's concert attracted the stadium's highest-ever attendance of 98,000. Since 1929, the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final had been held at the old Wembley Stadium, and in 2007, following Wembley's reconstruction, the cup final made its way back there. The stadium has also played host to several Rugby Union events and, from 2009 to 2017, Saracens frequently played Aviva Premiership and Heineken Cup matches there. The WBA and IBF super-middleweight championship rematch between Carl Froch and George Groves took place at Wembley Stadium on May 31, 2014, marking the venue's first boxing event. Since then, the stadium has hosted a number of notable boxing events, including the heavyweight bout between Anthony Joshua and Wladimir Klitschko. In April 2022, Tyson Fury remained undefeated as he was victorious over Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium, an event attended by 94,000 people, a record for boxing at the venue. Wembley Stadium has a long history with American football, dating back to 1984. Wembley has hosted several regular season NFL games since its renovation, a role it now shares with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. A seating plan for Wembley is available on the official Wembley stadium website. Wembley Stadium provides assisted behind-the-scenes stadium tours that include the dressing rooms, press room, players' tunnel and royal box. Tours are available every day of the week between 10:00am and 4:00pm (UK time), though times may vary on event days. Tickets cost ¬£22 for adults and ¬£15 for children; bookings and more details can be found on the official Wembley stadium website.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wembley-england-stadium-capacity-location-facts-video-tour/blt43e09a395c17853e,Nick Khairi,687814b2-f40b-42b6-96a5-7aa2439d6a8e
From invisible to heroic: How Italy become a dark horse for the Women's Euros,"'Calcio discovers women'.  When Italy women's national team last competed in a major tournament, that was Gazzetta dello Sport's headline, World Cup fever sweeping a football-obsessed nation that has yet to make the mark it is capable of on the women‚Äôs game. As the Azzurre reached the quarter-finals in France, beating China in the last 16 after topping a group that also featured Brazil, something was happening back home. The players wouldn‚Äôt realise that until after their exit in the last eight, to the European champions and eventual finalists, Netherlands. Upon flying home, they would be overwhelmed. Midfielder Aurora Galli remembers returning to her hometown to see the whole community in the piazza, there to celebrate her and what she had helped the country achieve. It was monumental. That summer proved a catalyst for Italy in its quest to unlock the potential of this great nation, a four-time World Cup winner on the men‚Äôs side which goes into this summer‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Euros as a serious dark horse. The players have an even greater opportunity to capture the public‚Äôs attention this time around, such has been the change that 2019 has helped to bring along. After it became mandatory for clubs competing in the men‚Äôs Serie A to have girls‚Äô academy in 2015, the landscape of the women‚Äôs game in Italy has been transformed. Juventus introduced a senior team two years later and were followed by many more giants ‚Äì Roma, Inter and Milan among them.  The teams have got stronger, as has the league, and, ahead of this summer, Italy took one of its biggest steps forward yet. Juventus was the country‚Äôs only representative in the 2021-22 Women‚Äôs Champions League group stages, drawn in a ‚Äògroup of death‚Äô with two-time champions Wolfsburg and last season‚Äôs finalists, Chelsea. Yet, they would come through it and go toe-to-toe with eventual champions Lyon in the next round, only losing 4-3 on aggregate. When Juve head coach Joe Montemurro speaks to GOAL about the challenge of taking on this job last summer, he remembers a ‚Äúlack of belief on the European stage‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe probably have exceeded expectations in year one,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúNow, obviously, people aren't going to probably take us in the manner that some clubs did, but it's great to have that on your back because you want to be at the top level. ‚ÄúYou want to be competing in real high-level competitions and playing against the best.  ""If we can get this more often, if we can get more top games at the Allianz, if we can always be in the Champions League group stage and be pitted against the best, it's going to be great for me because I get more games at top level and I learn, the players learn, and the club grows. ‚ÄúThey can plan things. They can say, 'Okay, well, Champions League brings in X amount of dollars, we can invest here and do this here. We need to fix up this area, we need to fix up that area.' ""But the only way you can grow is through playing the best and being at the top level. It's the only way you can grow.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just good for Juventus ‚Äì it‚Äôs good for Italy, who have seven players in their Women‚Äôs Euros squad from Montemurro‚Äôs side.  Indeed, that Champions League run shows that these players are among, and can compete with, Europe‚Äôs best. That‚Äôs huge for the present. It comes alongside the growth of the league in general, which is not limited to Juventus‚Äô success or that of the big clubs, but also taking into account the impressive progress of a team like Sassuolo, competing with those top teams on a much smaller budget. It also comes with the news that women‚Äôs football in Italy will turn professional for the coming season, which hopefully will only accelerate this already promising evolution. But big moments like the 2019 World Cup and Juventus‚Äô Champions League run are not only big for right now. They‚Äôre big for society. They‚Äôre big for the future. Attitudes in Italy are already changing.  When GOAL is picked up by a taxi from the Juventus training centre after speaking to Montemurro, it quickly emerges that the driver is a Bianconero, but he is not just a fan of the men‚Äôs team ‚Äì he loves the women‚Äôs team too. One of the reasons Italy has been lagging behind other nations is due to lower numbers of girls playing the sport.  That changing mindset in society can reduce of the barriers causing that. Young girls going to watch Juventus play big games, or watching Italy have a potentially great Euros, also helps. ‚ÄúWe have many, many other sports, like volleyball, basketball, and there are few teams,‚Äù Stefano Braghin, head of Juventus‚Äô women‚Äôs team, tells GOAL, talking about recruiting for the academy.  ‚ÄúThe girls usually start another sport and then as a second choice, they arrive at football. That doesn't help a lot in terms of the quality of your recruitment.‚Äù If that can change, though, there is something special to tap into. ‚ÄúFootball in Italy is very much part of the DNA,‚Äù Montemurro explains. ‚ÄúIt's really interesting because in all the players here I've got who are Italian, you just see a base understanding of tactical knowledge that a lot of the other countries probably don't have, because they grew up with it.‚Äù Now, Italy is starting to show that understanding and talent at the top level in the women‚Äôs game. Their performances in 2019 announced them to the world ‚Äì and to the wider public at home. This year, they‚Äôve only enhanced that reputation, not just in Juventus‚Äô success but the results of the national team ‚Äì beating the 2017 runners-up, Denmark and a fancied Norway earlier this year, while also drawing with Sweden, many people‚Äôs favourites, and Spain, another team talked about highly. The present and the future are both incredibly promising. It‚Äôs amazing to think what a terrific run at the Euros ‚Äì a run they‚Äôre perfectly capable of with the talent in this team ‚Äì would do on top of all that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/italy-women-euros-dark-horse/blt93faf04dda7c3b42,Ame√© Ruszkai,4f0a4624-3827-4a3c-a111-57eb81c567be
Juventus sign Chiesa in permanent ‚Ç¨40m transfer as purchase option triggered,"Juventus have activated their ‚Ç¨40 million (¬£34m/$42m) purchase option on Federico Chiesa, with the winger completing his permanent transfer from Fiorentina. Chiesa initially joined Juve on loan in October 2020 as they agreed to pay Fiorentina a loan fee of ‚Ç¨10m for two seasons with the right of redemption in 2023. The final deal also included an obligation to buy if certain conditions were met, including achieving Champions League qualification for 2022-23, and the Bianconeri have now confirmed the 24-year-old has been bought outright. Juve have confirmed in an official press release that they will pay Chiesa's full transfer fee in instalments over the next three years, and could end up paying a total of ‚Ç¨50m (¬£42m/$53m) including add-ons if he hits certain individual targets. The talented attacker took to social media to express his delight after making his move to the Allianz Stadium permanent, writing on Instagram: ""To be continued..."" Chiesa has scored 18 goals in his first 61 appearances in all competitions for Juve, while also recording 14 assists. The Italy international has helped the club win two trophies so far, including last season's Coppa Italia title, but his 2021-22 campaign was cut short by injury. Chiesa suffered cruciate knee ligament damage in January and is not expected to return to action until much later in the year, with Juve yet to give a firm update on his recovery.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-sign-chiesa-eur40m-transfer-purchase-option/blt19a74d554d73fa78,James Westwood,a07a1ffe-0a7a-4200-acc1-53814ca72c7d
Ronaldo warned he'll have to change under new Man Utd boss Rangnick as Kleberson tells him to help more,"Cristiano Ronaldo has been warned that he is going to have to ""change the way he plays"" in order to remain a talismanic presence for Manchester United under interim boss Ralf Rangnick, with the Portuguese still coming to terms with the fact that he was named on the bench for a trip to Chelsea. Caretaker coach Michael Carrick has been quick to rubbish any talk of unrest in the Red Devils camp after seeing his No.7 head straight down the tunnel at the end of a 1-1 draw in west London, with an all-time great merely rotated out of his plans as a different approach was favoured. There is every chance that Ronaldo will be returned to United‚Äôs starting XI for another heavyweight Premier League clash with Arsenal on Thursday, but Kleberson ‚Äì a former Old Trafford team-mate of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner ‚Äì believes he will need to offer more to the collective cause if Rangnick is to be convinced of his worth. Kleberson, who was speaking in association with Paddy Power, has told GOAL of the debate regarding Ronaldo‚Äôs value and whether he does enough off the ball in order to figure prominently under Rangnick: ‚ÄúCristiano Ronaldo can help Manchester United; he‚Äôs a leader and he can help the other players as well. ‚ÄúThere was a moment in the Chelsea game when they had a chance late on and Ronaldo tracked the full-back and tried to intercept the Chelsea cross. He tries to help Manchester United, but these are tough moments for them. It hasn‚Äôt been a great season. ‚ÄúI understand how frustrated he gets. His reaction is normal for a player who is not starting or is subbed early. They‚Äôre never going to be happy¬†with that. But Ronaldo is going to have to change the way he plays so that he helps the team more because that is what Manchester United need to get back to the top of the table.‚Äù The Brazilian added on the frustration which appeared to boil over when Ronaldo opted not to acknowledge the travelling support in United‚Äôs last outing: ‚ÄúCristiano Ronaldo was just frustrated at the end of the game when he headed straight down the tunnel. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt aimed at the supporters or manager. He came off the bench and they drew the game. Chelsea had more of the ball and more dangerous chances, all of the top players would be annoyed and frustrated by that.‚Äù Ronaldo was introduced in the 64th minute against Chelsea, with Jorginho cancelling out an effort from Jadon Sancho shortly after that change was made. He made little impact on proceedings, despite netting 10 times through 15 appearances since returning to Manchester over the summer, and Kleberson ‚Äì who was signed by United alongside Ronaldo back in 2003 ‚Äì can understand why a man that demands such high standards will be feeling disappointed at present. He added, with interim boss Rangnick - who will see things through to the end of the 2021-22 campaign - about to open another new era for the 13-time Premier League champions: ‚ÄúIt was surprising to see Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench for Manchester United. Everyone would have been surprised at Michael Carrick‚Äôs decision. I started to question what Manchester United actually want when they‚Äôve bought in the best player in the world, only to leave him on the bench in the big games. ‚ÄúBut, once the game started and listening to Carrick after the game about his game plan, it made sense. It was a brave decision to make, but he wanted to give other players an opportunity. It‚Äôs important to mention that he didn‚Äôt just bench Ronaldo, but he also benched other key players. ‚ÄúHis plan for the team worked well though, it made United defensively stronger, which has been one of their biggest problems this season. After the game, I understood Carrick‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúRonaldo‚Äôs reaction is normal ‚Äì no one wants to sit on the bench. All players want to play, and every player prepares to give their all and when you hear that you aren‚Äôt starting, it‚Äôs tough to take. Players will all react the same, his reaction was normal. Ronaldo wasn‚Äôt happy and that was clear, but after the first goal, he still ran to his team-mates to celebrate. ‚ÄúI understand his frustration as he wants to play every game.‚Äù United will play host to Arsenal on Thursday sat tenth in the English top-flight table, five points adrift of their midweek opponents and 15 behind leaders Chelsea.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-storming-down-tunnel-kleberson-man-utd-bench/blt09b4a37a20ed3317,Chris Burton,b853b680-78b2-4d91-8375-f81caa57df95
Klopp's new dilemma: Liverpool's squad depth means tough decisions lie ahead,"It‚Äôs been a while since Jurgen Klopp has found himself in this position. You know, the one where the headaches are welcome, where the biggest concerns are which top-class players to leave on the bench, and which ones to omit entirely. For the first time in two and a half years, the Liverpool boss has a full squad to choose from, a full deck of cards to shuffle.¬† And doesn‚Äôt that put the Reds in a great position, heading into the business end of the season? Klopp was grinning from ear to ear at Burnley on Sunday, and no wonder. ‚ÄúA perfect afternoon,‚Äù he called it, and he certainly wasn‚Äôt talking about the weather. ‚ÄúWe made our shirts dirty,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI am absolutely satisfied.‚Äù This, Klopp says, is the strongest squad he has ever managed, and it will be fascinating to see how he manages it in the coming weeks and months. Liverpool have four big targets in their sights, and no fewer than 24 senior players vying for places. Difficult decisions await. At Burnley, for example, there was disappointment for Joe Gomez and Curtis Jones, neither of whom were named in the 20-man matchday squad. Both are fit and available, as are Takumi Minamino and Divock Origi, who were also left at home. All four have contributed to Liverpool‚Äôs cause this season. Gomez has captained the team in the Carabao Cup, Jones had started the last five matches before the weekend, while Origi and Minamino have a dozen goals between them. But such is the strength of Klopp‚Äôs hand right now, that players of big pedigree are having to miss out, while others are having to get used to being part of a rotation policy. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember a situation like this before,‚Äù admitted Klopp last week. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had everyone available.‚Äù How long that will last, of course, is another matter. Liverpool know better than most how quickly injuries can engulf a squad, and with so many fixtures coming up, it is inevitable that bumps and bruises and strains and pulls will arrive. For now, though, they can enjoy their embarrassment of riches, and feel secure in the knowledge that even if their initial gameplan fails or stutters, they have players of genuine class to come on and change things. We‚Äôve seen that in the past 10 days; in the difference Harvey Elliott and Luis Diaz made against Cardiff, perhaps, or the impact of Mohamed Salah in the last 30 minutes against Leicester.¬† Against Burnley it was Thiago Alcantara emerging from the bench to add a bit more control and a lot more quality to proceedings after the out-of-form Jordan Henderson had struggled through the first hour. Diogo Jota and James Milner were Klopp‚Äôs other substitutes at Turf Moor, meaning Diaz and Elliott weren‚Äôt required. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kostas Tsimikas and Ibrahima Konate also remained unused. For a club criticised so often for its lack of depth, that‚Äôs an impressive show of strength. Klopp‚Äôs job will be a little more straightforward this week, with Jones and Gomez likely to return to the squad for the trip to Inter on Wednesday. Unlike in the Premier League, Champions League rules allow teams to name 12 substitutes, five of which can be brought on. After that Liverpool entertain Norwich and Leeds in the league, before the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley at the end of the month.¬† Big calls are coming, then. Hearts will be broken, for sure. There will be long faces on the bench in the coming weeks, and even longer faces in the stands. Never mind shirts, it‚Äôs the battle for tracksuits which is hotting up at Anfield. And with everything still to play for, Klopp wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-dilemma-liverpool-squad-depth-tough-decisions/bltfc0bfc654d92412b,Neil Jones,3f520233-a146-408c-821d-8518d26d121d
Why is Community Shield 2022 not at Wembley? King Power Stadium move explained,"In a departure from English football tradition, the annual season curtain-raiser, the Community Shield, will not be held at Wembley in 2022. Instead, the game, which sees Premier League champions Manchester City and FA Cup winners Liverpool go head to head, will be played at the King Power Stadium, home of Leicester City. It will be the first time in 10 years that the super cup showdown is not at 'The Home of Football'. On the previous occasion, the game was moved to Villa Park in Birmingham on account of the fact Wembley was in use for the 2012 Olympics. So, why has the Community Shield been moved away from Wembley in 2022? GOAL explains... This year's Community Shield was moved from Wembley to the King Power Stadium because the London venue is in use for the Women's Euro 2022 final between Germany and England. That game will be played at 5pm BST (12 noon ET) on Sunday, July 31. While the European Championship final does not strictly clash with the Community Shield, which takes place 24 hours earlier at 5pm on Saturday, July 30. It is not clear exactly why Leicester's stadium was chosen as a replacement, but it is a relatively modern event venue, with significant capacity, situated in a central location within England.

Will Premier League pause for Covid-19 circuit break?,"The Omicron variant of Covid-19 continues to rear its ugly head, with several Premier League clubs having to postpone their fixtures due to a high number outbreaks within the team. The festive fixture schedule is busy as it is, but with the likes of Manchester United having had to call off games due to their staff and players testing positive, will the Premier League be paused to prevent even more disruption in the long-term? GOAL takes a look. Currently, there are no plans to pause the current Premier League season due to the number of recent Covid-19 outbreaks within the clubs. A meeting was held with Premier League clubs on Monday, December 20 to discuss postponing fixtures in order to allow clubs to deal with the rising number of Covid-19 outbreaks within the UK. Several clubs, such as Tottenham and Man Utd, have dealt with several members of both team and staff testing positive for the virus. No such break, however ‚Äì at least for the time being ‚Äì will be enforced. The Premier League said in a statement: ""It was confirmed at a Premier League club meeting today that while recognising a number of clubs are experiencing Covid-19 outbreaks and challenges, it is the League‚Äôs collective intention to continue the current fixture schedule where safely possible."" During the 2019-20 season, the Premier League was suspended for four months ‚Äì from March 2020 to June 2020 ‚Äì due to disruptions caused by Covid-19. The official Premier League winter break is still scheduled to take place between January 23 and February 7, 2022. The Premier League went on to state that is their intention to continue playing fixtures ""where safely possible"". ""They stated: ""The health and wellbeing of all concerned remains our priority and the League will continue to monitor and reflect public health guidance, always proceeding with caution. The statement continued: ""A range of issues were discussed at this afternoon‚Äôs meeting, including the adaption of the Premier League Covid-19 postponement process in response to the impact of the Omicron variant. The Premier League also encouraged players to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and for booster shots to be taken up on across the division: ""The League also confirmed to its clubs today that 92 per cent of players and club staff have received one, two or three COVID-19 vaccination doses, with 84 per cent of players on the vaccination journey. ""Players who have had one or two doses are required to wait for the appropriate time period before receiving either their second or booster vaccinations. ""The League continues to work with clubs to encourage vaccination among players and club staff, as well as promoting the Government‚Äôs public-health vaccination messaging to clubs and the wider public."" READ: Which Premier League games have been cancelled due to Covid-19? An increasing number of Premier League games have been postponed due to positive cases within clubs. Brighton vs Tottenham, originally due to be played on December 12, was the first Premier League clash during the 2021-22 season to be cancelled due to a Covid-19 outbreak. Man Utd then announced that there were a large number of positive cases within the team and staff, which led to their December 14 game against Brentford to be postponed. Burnley vs Watford, Leicester vs Tottenham, Man Utd vs Brighton, Southampton vs Brentford, Watford vs Crystal Palace, West Ham vs Norwich, Aston Villa vs Burnley and Everton vs Leicester all got postponed as well.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/will-premier-league-pause-for-covid-19-circuit-break/bltd7f608da258861b3,Goal,fed95e4a-8797-4cd0-8966-74b28bb1644d
Sir Jim Ratcliffe net worth: Wealth & business interests of potential new Man Utd owner explained,"With the Glazer family confirming their intent to 'explore strategic alternatives' and sell Manchester United in 2022, naturally fans were ecstatic and potential bidders were put on standby. After years of protests from fans to sell up, it appears the Glazers finally look set to move on from United and sell the club in 2023. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been mooted as a potential buyer in the past, alongside the likes of Michael Knighton, but what does his personal fortune stand at and how did he accumulate the wealth that makes him a candidate to inherit the Red Devils‚Äô reins? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Net worth: ¬£13 billion ($15.6bn) Source of wealth: Oil, gas, chemicals Date of birth: October 18, 1952 Nationality: British The Sunday Times 'Rich List' in 2022 had Sir Jim Ratcliffe‚Äôs personal fortune estimated at ¬£6.075 billion ($7.4bn), listing him as the 27th richest person in the world. With his business interests added to the pot, he is understood to be worth around ¬£13bn ($15.6bn). The 69-year-old, who is now based in the tax haven of Monaco, has earned his fortune as the owner of multinational chemicals company Ineos. He was the co-founder of Inspec, which made money through shale gas, but launched Ineos in 1998 and has made them the fourth-largest chemicals company in the world ‚Äì with a diverse range of products including synthetic oils and plastics and solvents that are used to make insulin and antibiotics. His vast wealth has allowed him to take on a number of sporting ventures, with the keen cyclist having acquired the Team Sky racing team before rebranding them as Ineos in 2019 ‚Äì with Tour de France and Giro d‚ÄôItalia titles secured under his ownership. Ratcliffe also oversees Sir Ben Ainslie‚Äôs sailing team, Ineos Team UK, is one of the sponsors of the World Championship-winning Mercedes Formula One team and is the owner of Swiss football team FC Lausanne ‚Äì who he bought in 2017 ‚Äì and Ligue 1 outfit Nice. An offer for Chelsea was put to Roman Abramovich back in 2019, before returning to that negotiating table in 2022 as the Blues changed hands and eventually fell under the ownership of a Todd Boehly-led consortium. Ratcliffe, who was knighted in the Queen‚Äôs Birthday Honours list of June 2018 for his services to business and investment, grew up as a boyhood Manchester United supporter and has never shied away from the fact that he could be tempted into making a play for the club. That remains the case at present, with a spokesperson telling The Times: ""We have formally put ourselves into the process (of buying United)."" Calls for change at Old Trafford are mounting in intensity as the 13-time Premier League champions continue to regress on the field ‚Äì finishing sixth in the 2021-22 campaign ‚Äì while many millions of pounds have been wasted on questionable transfer business. Despite their resurgence under Erik ten Hag in 2022-23, calls for change from fans have remained consistent through protests and chants during home games.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sir-jim-ratcliffe-net-worth-wealth-business-interests-man/blt2fb92b16afa9cafb,Chris Burton,23bd3a72-f711-408c-87a8-42b0fb6f93f5
"Messi returning to Barcelona is 'not impossible', says Laporta adviser Masip","The prospect of Lionel Messi returning to Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain is not impossible, says an adviser to Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Barcelona coach Xavi said last week that the door at Camp Nou will always be open for the Argentina star, telling reporters: ""As long as I am Barca coach, he is welcome any day"". Messi has had a difficult start to life in Paris and was recently jeered by the club's fans following their Champions League elimination at the hands of Real Madrid. While Enric Masip has moved to calm speculation about a possible return for the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, he would not rule it out completely. ""Nothing is impossible, unlikely situations happen in life,"" Masip told Cadena SER.  ""Xavi's words were misunderstood. It wasn't a nod as such.  ""It was probably one of the most beautiful periods [for the club], but things went the way they did and he chose a project in Paris.  ""What may have seemed to be collapsing here in Barcelona, the team has survived and has worked well."" While Barca may not be pushing to bring Messi back to the club, they are eyeing one of Europe's hottest properties this summer. The Catalan side are among several top teams hoping to land Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund, alongside Manchester City and Real Madrid. Laporta admitted recently that he is not willing to risk putting the club in further financial trouble just to bring the 21-year-old to Camp Nou, and Masip reiterated that message this week. ""I refer to the words that the president said: the club is in a position to be able to sign players, but obviously, there have to be movements,"" he added. ""For someone to come in, someone has to leave. That is in the hands of the technical secretary and then later there is the economic part.  ""We come at it from an economic situation, but Barca has formulas and plans so that the team can perform at as high a level as possible.  ""Speaking of Haaland, he is a player who has enormous quality and is a true 'number nine'. On a football level, he is a player who would always be interesting to any big team.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-returning-barcelona-not-impossible-laporta-masip/bltc62246d2983b553d,By Peter McVitie,d0f06a56-f9cb-43ea-8eea-ea42821718fd
Trending: 'Bailly missed penalty so Salah can't return to Liverpool' - Afcon fans react ,"Manchester United defender Eric Bailly has found himself on the receiving end of fan banter following his penalty miss against Egypt on Wednesday. As a result, his nation Ivory Coast are out of the Africa Cup of Nations in the Round of 16 stage, a game which took place¬†at the Japoma Stadium in Douala, Cameroon. Bailly could not beat goalkeeper¬†Mohamed Abou Gabal - who came on as a substitute for the injured Mohamed El Shenawy - during the shootout after the two teams could not register a goal to separate them at full-time and in extra¬†time. The Pharaohs managed to successfully convert all their penalties, which were scored by¬†Ahmed Zizo,¬†Amroel Soulia, Omar Kamal, Mohamed Abdelmonem, and Mohamed Salah, while the Elephants scored their four shots through the efforts of Nicolas Pepe, Ibrahim Sangare, Maxwel Cornet, and Wilfried¬†Zaha. Fans have now joked that Bailly failed to score on purpose in order to have Egypt progress further in the competition so that Salah won't return to Liverpool early.

Fabio Vieira arrives for Arsenal medical ahead of ¬£30m transfer,"Arsenal have agreed a deal for Porto midfielder Fabio Vieira. GOAL can confirm that the 22-year-old has now arrived in London to undergo a medical and complete his shock ¬£30 million (‚Ç¨35m) switch to north London. He will sign a five year contract. The Gunners hope to confirm the signing quickly, either over the weekend or early next week. üí™ Que nota para este golo do F√°bio Vieira? ü§©üíôüóì Pre-season ‚öΩ FC Porto üÜö Lyon #FCPorto #FCPOL #UEL pic.twitter.com/azFjSusYi3 By Charles Watts, GOAL Arsenal correspondent A bolt from the blue!  It‚Äôs not often that a transfer comes out of nowhere and takes almost everyone by surprise, but Arsenal‚Äôs move for Fabio Vieira has done exactly that.  The Porto midfielder has not been one of the names linked to Arsenal this summer, with the Gunners known to be targeting Leicester City‚Äôs Youri Tielemans.  However Vieira will now be the first significant arrival of the transfer window at Emirates Stadium, with the Gunners confident of wrapping up the ¬£30m deal in the next few days. Vieira is hardly a household name, but his numbers with Porto last season show he will add talent and creativity to the Arsenal midfield, should the deal go through.  Mikel Arteta is desperate to strengthen his squad this summer and while Vieira may not be the name everyone was expecting to see arrive, his potential arrival looks set to be the catalyst for a busy couple of months in north London. One of the most promising young talents to come out of Portugal's well-respected youth scene in the past few years, Vieira is a midfielder preparing to burst out onto the biggest scenes after superb domestic form. A product of Porto's academy, he made the leap up to the senior side in 2019-20 before cementing his place over the following two years as a key performer for the club in their pursuit of domestic success. A move to a bigger league among the European heavyweights is a natural progression - but with six goals in 27 top-flight games last term, it will be curious to see if he is able to bridge the gap successfully and deliver for the Gunners, as Arteta looks to bolster his team around the middle of the park.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-working-on-vieira-transfer-arteta-porto/blt630d4b78f23ff84b,Charles Watts,9cb6dd71-f234-42db-aadf-29e72e9231af
England suffer stunning 4-0 home loss to Hungary with players booed during UEFA Nations League clash,"England suffered their worst home defeat for 94 years as they were stunned 4-0 at home by Hungary in their UEFA Nations League clash on Tuesday. It is the first time England have been beaten by four goals in a home game since a 5-1 loss to Scotland in 1928. England's players were soundly booed at the full-time whistle by the home fans at Molineux, with the pressure now on manager Gareth Southgate going into the World Cup later this year. While they dominated possession, England created precious little and were picked off by a clinical Hungarian side which scored from four of its five shots on target. It is the first time England have conceded four goals at home since 1953, when they went down 6-3 to the same opponents. 4 - Hungary are the first team to score four goals in an away match against England since the Hungarians themselves won 6-3 at Wembley in November 1953. Wolves. pic.twitter.com/2U1zzsbvsy Roland Sallai opened the scoring after 16 minutes with a smartly taken strike after Kalvin Phillips failed to clear a free kick, and doubled the advantage after 70 minutes following a Hungary counter-attack. Zsolt Nagy and Daniel Gazdag then capped a miserable night for Southgate and England, while John Stones was also sent off for a second bookable offence. The result means England stay bottom of their UEFA Nations League group and in danger of relegation to the second tier of the competition - but of bigger concern was the flat and uninspired performance, resulting in a home defeat by four goals without scoring for their first time ever. Boos as England leave the pitch pic.twitter.com/7cmCULyTYq GOAL's James Robson was at Molineux, and gives his view on a desperate night for England... That was hostile and toxic - and it leaves Gareth Southgate with a lot to think about over the summer. Let's not forget that England face two more difficult games in the next international window - against Italy away and Germany at home. Whether or not you value the Nations League, those are games laced with danger for a manager who has seen the fans turn on him less than a year after leading England to the Euros final. No doubt it felt like an over-reaction from the Molineux crowd, but supporters cannot be ignored. That was probably the worst reaction since Roy Hodgson led England to defeat against Iceland at the Euro 2016. Boos rang around the stadium, while Southgate had to endure chants of ""You don't know what you're doing"" and ""You're getting sacked in the morning."" The players, meanwhile, faced chants of ""Shame on you"" as they went to applaud the crowd at the end. This was a miserable end to a miserable quartet of games. It was a hapless performance that deserves all the criticism it gets, but to call for Southgate's head is remarkable, given his achievements as England manager. For all of this success, the nature of defeats to Croatia at the World Cup and Italy at the Euros left him open to criticism over his ability to get England over the line. That will, no doubt, be used as ammunition against him as he faces calls to be sacked. England captain Harry Kane told Channel 4: ""A disappointing night. First half we created enough chances to score but it has been the story of our Nations League, we have not quite had the cutting edge. ""Second half was not acceptable after going 2-0 down. It is not the time to panic, we have to the heads up and come back stronger in September. ""Let's not forget where we have come from, our first final in 60 years [at Euro 2020], a semi-finals in the World Cup compared to where we have been in the last 50 years. I understand the fans' frustration, we will keep working to try and have a successful World Cup."" When asked about the boos aimed at Southgate and whether the manager's future is in question, Kane said: ""It's not even a question I should be answering."" As bad as England were, Hungary fully earned a historic win. They were the first side to score four goals away to England since the great Magyar side of Ferenc Puskas, which won 6-3 at Wembley in 1953. After the game, Hungary manager Marco Rossi threw his support behind Southgate, saying: ""Everybody must be aware sometimes these kind of results can happen. They [England] didn‚Äôt produce the right effort. ""4-0 is difficult to accept, but I think Southgate proved he is quite a good coach. They [England] are absolutely on the top level and must follow the track they followed until now. I am convinced they will give to you a lot of joy in the next World Cup. I am sure of that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-hungary-defeat-players-booed-uefa-nations-league/blta46e12175466cd77,Emma Smith,b595f275-190f-4d6d-b9a1-fb5d9ff4fef4

Eddie Nketiah's Arsenal contract: Salary details & when does it expire,"Eddie Nketiah continues to head towards an important career crossroads at Arsenal, with the promising striker approaching the end of a contract at Emirates Stadium that could lead to him hitting free agency in the summer of 2022. There is still a chance that the 22-year-old will agree to extend his association with the Gunners, with a productive run in Mikel Arteta‚Äôs plans towards the end of the current campaign suggesting that there is a role for him to play in north London. Interest is, however, building in the all-time leading goalscorer for England‚Äôs U21 side and questions remain when it comes to his future plans. What is his current deal worth and will he be signing another? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Nketiah committed to a ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù contract with Arsenal in December 2017, with it later revealed that those terms would take him through to the end of the 2021-22 campaign. The current campaign has proved to be his most productive in front of goal, with a personal-best return of nine efforts recorded, but he is yet to reach 100 appearances for the Gunners. He may believe that, having previously spent time on loan at Leeds United, there are more opportunities to be found elsewhere, while an increase to his ¬£45,000-a-week salary will likely be enjoyed whether he opts to remain at Emirates Stadium or try his luck elsewhere. Contract signed December 2017 Duration of contract Five years Expiry date June 2022 Salary ¬£45,000 a week/¬£2.34m a year Having found regular opportunities hard to come by during the first half of the 2021-22 season, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette took on striking duties, Nketiah has enjoyed a welcome return to favour since the end of January. He has registered four Premier League goals, with important braces hit in wins over Chelsea and Leeds, to go alongside the five Carabao Cup efforts he recorded earlier in the season ‚Äì with a hat-trick struck against Sunderland in December. Arteta has been impressed, but has said when asked about Nketiah‚Äôs future: ‚ÄúEddie is doing what he‚Äôs done all season, he‚Äôs been very consistent, with his performances and how little he is giving things away! Let him be, let him enjoy the moment because he completely deserves it and things will happen naturally.‚Äù The man himself has said of coming back into contention: ‚ÄúIt's amazing to be involved. Any player just wants to be playing and get the opportunities. I've worked hard throughout the season to make sure that I was ready when I got my chance.‚Äù Nketiah has, however, previously admitted to shunning offers of a new contract as he continues to mull over his options. He told the Beautiful Game Podcast in April: ‚ÄúThere have been offers of a new contract but at the moment my aim is to play football and play regularly. That‚Äôs my ambition and that‚Äôs what I hope to do but at the same time I‚Äôm at Arsenal, I love Arsenal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to focus on the season until May and make sure I finish that in a good way and then sit down and see what I think is the best opportunity to allow me to take those steps and develop. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm at the stage where I‚Äôve signed a contract for five years when I was 18 and in that five years, how many starts have I had here? I went on loan for six months and been here for the rest and I have probably started about 30 games maybe in all competitions. ‚ÄúI see players my age that I‚Äôve played with and they kick on and it‚Äôs like ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the difference between someone I was playing with at England Under-21s?‚Äô. ‚ÄúI was the captain and they‚Äôre doing more. It‚Äôs not even a thing of looking at them and hating them, I‚Äôm happy for them, but how did they get to the point where they are feeling confident and it‚Äôs through playing those games and having that experience. ‚ÄúFor me to take the next step and get to where I think I can get to I obviously need to consider getting more minutes.‚Äù Eddie Nketiah is taking his chance üëè pic.twitter.com/LQjhaV4Z7Z As uncertainty continues to reign in north London when it comes to Nketiah‚Äôs future intentions, rumours of interest being shown from afar continue to rage. Crystal Palace, who are now managed by Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira, are said to be leading any hunt for a potential free agent. Leeds United, who handed Nketiah just two starts during a loan spell in 2019-20 that was cut short midway through the season, are also said to be showing interest again ‚Äì although they will be hoping to have Patrick Bamford back from injury next term and are battling to fend off relegation out of the Premier League. Newcastle United, with ambitious plans being drawn up at St James‚Äô Park, are in the mix for proven performers that can aid their cause on Tyneside. West Ham United are another side to have placed in the Nketiah-hunting pot, with David Moyes having been in the market for a new number nine for some time and will likely have European football to use as a bargaining chip if a man currently chasing down Champions League qualification opts to walk out on the Gunners.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/eddie-nketiah-arsenal-contract-salary-when-expire/blt2b869c382783d2d8,Chris Burton,15ec259b-6c76-4cba-9ca4-a3aef57c6c1b
From Bailly to Martial: Ten Hag taking no prisoners in Man Utd's big summer clear-out,"Manchester United are prepared to offload another nine players as part of Erik ten Hag's summer clear-out. The Dutchman is targeting five signings in his first transfer window at the club ‚Äì and wants to work with a leaner squad than predecessors Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. That will require a huge exodus before the start of the season, in addition to the high-profile departures of Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard, Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata already. Eric Bailly and Phil Jones will both be allowed to leave, while Anthony Martial and Aaron Wan-Bissaka will have to impress their new manager in pre-season. Ten Hag set out his plans during a transfer summit with football director, John Murtough, in Amsterdam in May. They agreed a new regime was the perfect chance for a reset, with the exits of a host of players seen as key to the overhaul the former Ajax manager plans to implement at Old Trafford. The number of high-earners who have come to the end of their contracts, with Pogba the most notable case, has aided Ten Hag‚Äôs squad revamp.  It will have a big impact on the wage bill, which should also give United more room for manoeuvre in what is expected to be their busiest summer in recent memory. They are closing in on the ¬£56 million ($68m) signing of Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona and have had a bid of ¬£13m ($16m) for Tyrell Malacia accepted by Feyenoord. Free agent Christian Eriksen has also been offered a contract. Ajax forward Antony is a leading forward target, with clubmate Lisandro Martinez among the names Ten Hag is considering at centre-back along with Villarreal‚Äôs Pau Torres. Ten Hag is also an admirer of Inter right-back Denzel Dumfries.   But just as notable as the incomings, will be the departures in a summer of major change...",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/bailly-martial-man-utd-summer-clear-out/blt4c62da87d4552a42,James Robson,c3e12dde-eee7-44cd-a871-0c9433ae8512
Osimhen: My determination to prove doubters wrong key to Napoli success,"Nigeria international Victor Osimhen has attributed his run of form with Napoli to his determination to prove doubters wrong. The 23-year-old Super Eagle is having a good season in Serie A where he has so far managed 12 goals from 23 appearances. However, his goalscoring form was derailed in November when he picked up an injury and needed surgery to repair his face. It was the injury that eventually ruled him out of the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon where Nigeria failed to get past the Round of 16 after being eliminated by Tunisia. He, however, returned to action for Napoli in January while wearing a protective mask. ‚ÄúFrom the moment I had my surgery, I read some people saying ‚ÄòThe season is over for him‚Äô,‚Äù Osimhen said as quoted by BBC Sport Africa. ‚Äú‚ÄòWhen he comes back, he wouldn't go head-to-head with a defender'. 'Even with a mask, he cannot nod the ball' and stuff like that. ‚ÄúMost of all those doubts are actually a motivation to me. Because I know myself and I know the kind of heart that I've got. To be able to be back and keep the goals coming is a big thing for me. ‚ÄúI appreciate people that have worked so hard with me to make sure I'm okay even when I had the surgery and everything. They probably doubted me returning to my best because of the impact the facial incident could've had on my mental health.‚Äù Osimhen, whose display is attracting top European clubs among them Manchester United, Arsenal, and Newcastle United, insists he has proven people wrong. ‚ÄúI must thank all those who stood by me,‚Äù Osimhen continued. ‚ÄúI appreciate the love. ‚ÄúOf course, I want to keep on going and kudos to my teammates ‚Äì they‚Äôve been supportive to me, on and off the pitch. And I think this is the most important thing that any footballer can ask for.‚Äù Having played in French and Belgian leagues before moving to Napoli, Osimhen maintains that the Italian top-flight remains the toughest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really physical, just like what we‚Äôve been hearing before I even became a professional footballer,‚Äù Osimhen continued. ‚ÄúTactically, they‚Äôre really sound. The defenders are strong and disciplined too. ‚ÄúBut a player [like me] never backs down no matter the circumstances, no matter the scoreline, no matter the team I play. I want to go so hard; I want to go so extreme to get my goals to try to help the team. ‚ÄúI believe without these early setbacks, I can actually do more. And I challenge myself into doing more than I have done in the previous seasons. Of course, I did it in Belgium. I did it in Lille.

"Manchester City star Zinchenko: Russians killed our children, raped our women and ate our dogs","Manchester City's Oleksandr Zinchenko has opened up about the ""nightmare"" being inflicted on his home country of Ukraine, including horrific details from the Russian invasion which he has heard and seen. Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, leaving thousands dead and millions more forced to flee their homes, while Zinchenko and other Ukrainians abroad have been forced to watch on in horror. Zinchenko has been vocal in his condemnation of Russia's military aggression, and spared no detail as he raged against those who attempt to deny the reality of the situation in his homeland. Speaking to the Guardian, Zinchenko said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nightmare. A shock to the whole world, the things they have done there. Terrible, scary things. They killed our civilians. They killed our children. They raped our women and girls. They killed our dogs and even ate them. I cannot even begin to describe how I feel about them. ‚ÄúI hate them so much, for everything they have done to the Ukrainian people and Ukraine. I hate the people in Russia who are trying to convince others that this is propaganda. It‚Äôs embarrassing. How can they say this?  ""People send me the real pictures, the real facts. The bodies of our dead civilians were lying on the ground for two weeks. They have to take responsibility for this.‚Äù Zinchenko and other Ukrainian footballers in England have been supported by their clubs and fans - he was made Man City captain for their FA Cup clash against Peterborough, with fans in the stands carrying Ukraine flags and other banners in support. However, Zinchenko thinks footballers could do more to condemn the violence, particularly those in Russia - where he played for two years with FC Ufa - and said silence equates acceptance and support for the invasion. Zinchenko said: ‚ÄúI have friends over there, a small circle, but now it has reduced almost to nothing. I‚Äôm so disappointed. ""The guys I know called me as soon as the invasion happened, texted me: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sorry Alex, but we can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äô Of course you can. If you stay silent it means you support what is happening in Ukraine right now, and I can‚Äôt see why they would. ""Maybe they are scared, because we see pictures on social media of Russians being taken to prison if they protest. But look at footballers in particular, or anyone with a massive audience. ""Can you believe that, if all of them posted something on Instagram at the same time saying: ‚ÄòGuys, we are against the war, we need to stop it,‚Äô they would all be arrested? Of course they would not.

Osimhen: Napoli 'will fight to the end' to win Serie A title,"Victor Osimhen has promised that Napoli not give up on their chances of winning the Serie A title this season. The Parthenopeans survived an early scare from Udinese but recorded a 2-1 victory in Saturday‚Äôs league match. Following an assist from Roberto Pereyra, Gerard Deulofeu gave the Little Zebras a 22nd minute lead at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. However, Luciano Spalletti‚Äôs men produced a commanding second-half display to garner maximum points. First, Osimhen headed Mario Rui‚Äôs cross past goalkeeper Marco Silvestri in the 52nd minute, before completing his brace three minutes after the hour mark. Thanks to the result, the Naples-based outfit occupy the second position with just three points separating them from leaders AC Milan.¬† And the former Lille goal machine has vowed that they will continue to fight for Italian football's top prize. ‚ÄúOur response was great,‚Äù Osimhen told Napoli's website. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to have got on the scoresheet but I‚Äôm especially pleased to get the victory.

Real Madrid will give Militao major wage boost in contract renewal to show faith in defender,"Real Madrid will reward Eder Militao for his performances this season by offering him an improved contract, GOAL understands. The defender still has three years left on his current deal, but he is one of the lowest-paid among the main players in the Madrid squad. Militao made 50 appearances in all competitions to help Madrid secure the Champions League and La Liga titles and the club want to upgrade his pay to reflect his role with the team. GOAL¬†can confirm that Militao's representatives will meet with the Madrid board in the coming days to discuss the final details of his new deal.¬† ‚Äã‚ÄãPresident Florentino Perez's intention is not only to raise the 24-year-old's salary but also to demonstrate the confidence that the club have in the Brazilian.¬† Furthermore, they expect his value to rise in the near future as his stature in the Brazil team is also growing. Militao is happy at Madrid and ready to sign a new deal. The centre-back made the switch to the Santiago Bernabeu from Porto in 2019. Militao had to bide his time before being sure of a spot in the starting XI. He featured 15 times in La Liga in his first season and 14 in his second before being trusted with a regular place in the first-team in 2021-22. When Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos left last summer, there was fear that Real Madrid's back line would suffer.

"Frank responds to rumours of Brentford signing Eriksen: If they fit the criteria of no d*ckheads, they can play for us","Brentford boss Thomas Frank is flattered to see his club linked with Christian Eriksen, while affirming that the Denmark international meets his ""no d*ckhead"" recruitment rule.

Sanchez joins Marseille after Inter terminate contract of ex-Arsenal and Man Utd star,"Alexis Sanchez has joined Marseille after Inter Milan terminated the winger's contract by mutual consent. After joining Inter from Manchester United in 2019, the 33-year-old made 109 appearances across all competitions for the club and scored 20 goals.  Sanchez helped Inter lift the Scudetto in the 2020-21 season and also picked up Supercoppa Italiana and Coppa Italia medals last term.  However, the Chilean international made just seven starts in Serie A in the 2021-22 campaign as he fell down the pecking order under Simeone Inzaghi. Writing on his Instagram story, Sanchez reflected on his time with Inter and thanked the club and their fans.  ""Here I leave three trophies after 11 years. Thank you and good luck, see you soon,"" he said.  Inter have also put out a statement wishing the veteran attacker luck in the next chapter of his career.

Martial loan transfer agreed between Man Utd & Sevilla,"Anthony Martial is set to join Sevilla on loan after Manchester United came to an agreement with the Spanish outfit.¬† United rejected an initial loan request from the Liga side earlier in the month, but GOAL understands the issues have been ironed out and Martial is set for a medical in Spain.¬† Juventus were one of a number of other sides who were interested in the France international but sources say Sevilla were his preferred choice.¬† Martial was given the club‚Äôs blessing to talk to other clubs about a transfer this month after a chat in December with Ralf Rangnick, where he stated his intentions to leave due to a lack of playing time.¬† The 26-year-old has only started two Premier League games this season and an incident which was later described as a ‚Äòmisunderstanding‚Äô between Rangnick and Martial saw the German manager declare the player had refused to be part of the matchday squad against Aston Villa a couple of weeks ago. United rejected Sevilla‚Äôs initial loan request for Martial as they wanted a ¬£5 million loan fee, as well as the club to cover his wages. At the time the Spanish side were only offering to cover half of his wages.¬† Since then Martial‚Äôs representatives have held talks with Juventus, but it is understood the player preferred a move to Spain and discussions between United and Sevilla progressed over the weekend. Martial was prepared to take a wage cut in order to push the deal through.¬† Indeed, Sevilla will pay ‚Ç¨6m towards Martial's salary, with the Frenchman's willingness to take a pay cut meaning that United will not need to pay any wage contribution. The loan will last until the end of the 2021-22 season, with Sevilla not required to pay a loan fee. There will be no purchase option included although there is a clause that would lead to a second loan spell for the 2022-23 campaign, should all parties be happy to proceed. The Frenchman had talks with Rangnick shortly after he arrived to outline his plans to leave this month over a lack of playing time.¬† The 26-year-old came on as a second half substitute in the 1-0 win against West Ham on Saturday and those eight minutes were the first he had played under the German.¬† Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs arrival saw him fall further down the pecking order and after he had submitted his transfer request, he was omitted from the matchday squads. Rangnick told the media he wanted to include the Frenchman in the squad for the away-day trip to Villa in the Premier League but that the player refused to be involved.¬† Martial refuted those claims on his social media channels, saying he would never refuse to play for the club.¬† This season he has made just four starts in all competitions for United and is hoping to get more minutes in Spain to put himself in a better place to secure a position in France‚Äôs World Cup squad later this year.¬† While incomings remain unlikely, it‚Äôs possible there could be a couple of departures. Newcastle are pushing to try and secure Jesse Lingard on loan. The England international is open to a temporary move to the North East but a deal has yet to be agreed between the two clubs. Teenage winger Amad would also be allowed to leave the club on loan this window. It is understood there has been interest from Derby and Birmingham this month but there has yet to be a concrete offer from any club.

Arsenal star Partey reveals Will Smith would play him in a movie of his life,"Thomas Partey has revealed who he would like to play him in a hypothetical movie of his life, with the Arsenal midfielder plumping for blockbuster Hollywood actor Will Smith as his choice. The Ghana international also opened up on who he pretended to be when he used to play games at school on the playground, what meal he would eat every day for the rest of his life and who the smartest player at the Gunners is alongside him. Partey has been at the forefront of Mikel Arteta's side's resurgence this season, and despite the gulf in ages - Smith is a quarter-century older than the playmaker - he feels that it would be the Independence Day and Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star who should take on the role. Asked on who should play him in a quickfire interview with Sky Sports, Partey hesitated before naming Smith - currently the frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in King Richard - as his ideal pick. Elsewhere, he revealed that he pretended to be Chelsea legend Didier Drogba when he used to embark on kickabouts as a youngster, while adding that chicken and rice would be the one dish he could happily eat every day for the rest of his life. Partey also hailed team-mate Emile Smith Rowe as the smartest player he starts alongside for Arsenal, praising the England man for his intelligent game management. Arsenal face a crunch week for their Champions League qualification aspirations over the next seven days, with the Gunners set to take on title-chasing Liverpool and an in-form Aston Villa in the Premier League. Arteta's side know that both Jurgen Klopp and Steven Gerrard will present tough challenges for them to overcome.

Man Utd's Pogba opens up on depression: 'You just want to isolate yourself',"Paul Pogba has acknowledged that he has struggled with depression during his career, saying it has made him want to isolate himself at times. The midfielder has faced constant criticism since joining Manchester United, with some pundits going as far as to question his character. He has joined a growing number of players, including Neymar and Marcus Rashford, to speak out about mental health issues. ""I've had depression in my career, but we don't talk about it,"" Pogba told Le Figaro. ""Sometimes you don't know you are, you just want to isolate yourself, be alone, these are unmistakable signs."" Besides dealing with persistent media pressure, Pogba was recently burgled while his children were at home. The incident has also had a negative effect on his well-being. ""I discover my home burglarized after the intrusion of three people who stole my safe,"" he said. ""There were jewels from my mother, my world champion medal. ""What scared me the most was that my two children were at home with the nanny during this incident. She overheard everything, called my wife and security, then locked herself in with the boys into a room. For several days, she was shocked. The main thing is that my children are well."" Pogba, of course, is known for having a huge personality and expressing himself on social media. Behind the scenes, though, his mental health has taken a hit and it has become difficult to tap into that infectious enthusiasm. Fortunately for the French star, he appears happy to be back on international duty this week. So happy to be back with the national team.

'The manager had to have some balls' - Tuchel explains decision to introduce Pulisic as a wing-back in Chelsea's win vs Newcastle,"Thomas Tuchel said it took ""big balls"" to play Christian Pulisic as a wing-back in Chelsea's win over Newcastle. The Blues took down Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday, with Kai Havertz's late winner proving just enough to seal a crucial win. Tuchel opted to introduce Pulisic for Malang Sarr in the 78th minute, sticking the American star in defence, and he admitted that it took some ""big balls"" to make that call. Tuchel was reminded of the fact that he called on his players to have ""big balls"" before explaining his decision to play Pulisic in defence. ""Did I say that?! Okay. The manager had to have some balls to make these decisions,"" he began. ""As you are aware, today we started with a 4-1-4-1. [Cesar Azpilicueta] was out, Reece James was out and Callum [Hudson-Odoi] played there [at wing-back] and was out.  ""Pulisic came from some days off feeling sick so we struggled to find a right wing-back. Marcos [Alonso] struggled through his corona times and we were not sure if he could make it so we started in a 4-1-4-1. In the second half, it was a back five.  ""Malang is good in defending but we took the risk on the left side to be more offensive. We defended against their strikers in more of a three against three. Jorginho was the man in front of the back three to control counterattacks and long balls. Hakim [Ziyech] did it against Tottenham who had a back five and it was a bit of the same situation as against Tottenham in one of the four games we played recently.  ""It is not their best position but it is a bit easier for a player like Christian to do it when they come into the match. We took the risk to increase the offensive threat with some runs. In the end, we have a run with Kai and Christian Pulisic to arrive in the box.  ""In the end, I am happy because Malang was important for defending set-pieces and it was a bit of a gamble."" Tuchel went on to explain why he was willing to take that gamble as he was prepared to sacrifice one point to potentially seal three. ""The game was a draw and I thought, 'Okay, we are risking the point now but if we lose we only lose a point. But we could win two more points so we took it,"" he said. ""I am happy because the impact from the bench was very strong with [Mateo Kovacic], Christian was strong and Romelu [Lukaku] gave us more presence.  ""We took the risk for three and I am happy we took it."" The win was a vital one for Chelsea amid a week of uncertainty due to the sanctions handed down to owner Roman Abramovich and, ultimately, the club. Chelsea remain third in the Premier League, eight points ahead of fourth-place Arsenal, who have two games in hand.  They're seven points behind second-place Liverpool, though, while Manchester CIty lead the league with a 10-point gap on the Blues.  Next up for Chelsea is a return to the Champions League, as they look to defend their title heading into a second-leg clash with Lille in the round of 16. The Blues currently hold a 2-0 advantage heading into that second leg, with Havertz and Pulisic providing the goals in the opening leg.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/manager-balls-tuchel-explains-decision-pulisic-wing-back-chelsea-/blt547de381516c08ed,Ryan Tolmich,c046d159-28a5-4970-a874-46743d7d5ca6
Nagelsmann is kidding himself - Bayern Munich's embarrassing Champions League exit should come as no surprise,"It was approaching an hour after the final whistle had blown at the Allianz Arena and Julian Nagelsmann had still not appeared for his post-match press conference. In the time that had passed, Villarreal had managed to spend time celebrating their famous Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich with their fans in the upper tier of the stadium, retreated to the dressing room for more partying, before again appearing on the pitch to the joy of their travelling supporters. Man of the Match Raul Albiol had been part of the revelry, but had also found the time to hold his own press conference after marshalling a superb defensive display by Unai Emery's side. Nagelsmann, though, had not been seen. When he did eventually appear in the press conference room, he looked decidedly grim but composed. ""I think we lost the tie in the first leg,"" he explained.¬†""If you look at our performance today - tactically good by the way, defensively and offensively - it puts the first leg in a worse light."" The Bayern boss would later go on to describe his team's display as being ""very good"", but it is hard not to think that he is kidding himself; trying to put on a brave face and pass this failure off as being the result of bad luck. In reality, this was not a performance to be proud of, nor one that came as a great shock given the Bavarians' recent form. Tuesday's 1-1 draw means that since beating RB Leipzig on February 5, Bayern have won just six of their last 12 games - an appalling run for a team that has been so dominant both domestically and in Europe. Despite dominating the game in terms of possession and territory, their expected goals (xG) total against Villarreal was 1.58. The only times it has been worse since the winter break were the first leg in Spain and Saturday's narrow win over relegation-threatened Augsburg. Bayern may have a more talented squad than Villarreal, who currently sit seventh in La Liga, but they showed little creativity when trying to break their visitors down, and instead found themselves sending almost endless crosses into the box. In total, they attempted 39 crosses in the match, few of which resulted in meaningful attempts on goal. They managed just four shots on target across the 90 minutes, with many of their efforts coming from distance. They had some moments, with Kingsley Coman causing problems with his dribbling while Robert Lewandowski's finish for the opening goal on the night was excellent, but on the whole they lacked the ideas to get through the yellow wall that Villarreal presented them with. And some of the blame for that has to be shouldered by Nagelsmann. The 34-year-old has regularly spoken of his players not being at their ""peak"" in recent weeks, but it is becoming clear that the peak of Nagelsmann's first season in charge came back in the early weeks of winter. When Bayern were playing well under the ex-RB Leipzig boss, the key for them in an attacking sense came down the left-hand side, with Alphonso Davies and Leroy Sane combining to devastating effect. The 3-2-3-2 formation that Nagelsmann unveiled for the first time on Tuesday would, in theory, have been perfect for that duo, but circumstances meant that neither were on the left-hand side against Villarreal. Davies was on the bench as he continues his recovery from the heart problem that ruled him out of action for over two months, while Sane was shunted out to right in the hope that a change of position could resurrect his season after an alarming drop in form. That Nagelsmann would try such a system in the most important game of the season without the players he needed to make it work either available to start or playing at the required level is concerning, but hopefully something he can learn from. In truth, other more senior players failed to turn up on the night. Joshua Kimmich lacked his usual presence in central midfield, while Thomas Muller and Lewandowski's connection seemed to be off, and not for the first time in recent weeks. It was also telling that Nagelsmann waited until the 82nd minute to make a substitution, introducing Serge Gnabry from the bench in a sign that he is neither happy with the form of the ex-Arsenal man, nor the strength in depth of his squad. That is a problem that may get worse before it gets better. Gnabry is one of a host of players whose contract has just one more year to run on it, and GOAL has learned that the winger is contemplating his future amid interest from Real Madrid and Liverpool. Lewandowski is also out of contract in 2023, and while Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn insisted ahead of kick-off on Tuesday that the European Golden Shoe frontrunner is ""definitely"" staying at Bayern this summer, results such as this one on the biggest stage could prove decisive as the Poland international weighs up his future options. And so while Bayern have all but wrapped up a 10th successive Bundesliga title, that will be the only trophy they win in 2022, having already been dumped out of the DFB-Pokal in embarrassing fashion by Borussia Monchengladbach, who beat them 5-0 in the second round. That result came as a shock at the time, but Bayern's European exit was far more predictable, even if few from outside Munich saw it coming. Nagelsmann will have plenty more time to reflect on what went wrong, but one thing is for certain: nothing about Bayern's elimination was ""good"".",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-champions-league-exit-no-surprise-nagelsmann-knows-/blt19143c51245e9eff,Nino Duit,a959de81-741c-484c-a25f-15f5619d081c

"Koln's Modeste celebrates goal vs Bielefeld by promoting his own coffee brand, DFB open disciplinary investigation","Anthony Modeste is facing disciplinary action over a bizarre goal celebration, with the Koln striker opting to promote his own coffee brand by handing out free samples to supporters during a Bundesliga clash with Arminia Bielefeld. The 34-year-old frontman has been in fine form again this season, with the target found on 20 occasions in all competitions. He has had plenty of practice when it comes to toasting an effort that finds the back of the net, but he took things a step too far in his latest outing and could find himself in hot water with the German Football Association (DFB). The French forward gave Koln a 2-1 lead in the 43rd minute of their game against Arminia and had a carefully-choreographed celebration mapped out. He broke out a bag of his own coffee and presented it to fans, camera operators and photographers. Modeste then threw the bag into crowd, before distributing more samples to supporters at the final whistle. In an effort to explain his actions, an experienced performer said: ‚ÄúIt was a little thank you for the people, they have always supported me. Because I can't give my jersey, I gave my coffee.‚Äù Koln coach Steffen Baumgart admitted to reporters afterwards that he expected Modeste to face punishment, saying of a remarkable incident: ‚ÄúIt's always complicated in football. You mustn't get too excited. Otherwise, you'll get a kick in your face, that's what I've experienced.‚Äù The Frenchman‚Äôs coffee brand is simply called Anthony Modeste Kaffee and is made from ingredients sourced from Brazil and India. A description of the product reads: ‚ÄúThe best raw coffee varieties from all over the world are selected by our coffee experts and gently roasted in small quantities. ‚ÄúWe refine the coffee fresh every day using the traditional drum roasting process. This long-term roasting makes our coffee particularly aromatic and easily digestible. ‚ÄúThis allows the coffee to develop its unmistakable taste and aroma.‚Äù The DFB is yet to rule on whether Modeste will face disciplinary action over his coffee-themed celebration, but they are opening an investigation. Anton Nachreiner, chairman of the DFB control committee, has told the organisation‚Äôs official website: ‚ÄúWe will investigate the process.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/koln-modeste-celebrates-goal-bielefeld-promoting-own-coffee/blt386636ceb1600ba0,Chris Burton,994abb06-d8bf-4962-9043-008edba6ff6f
Fernandes the difference as Man Utd beat Southampton in second straight Premier League win,"WHAT HAPPENED? Fernandes rounded off a fine United move to give his side the lead in the second half of the clash at Southampton. The Red Devils were able to hold out for the three points in a narrow victory. THE BIGGER PICTURE: United started the week with an impressive 2-1 win against Liverpool on Monday. Although they had a quiet first half against the Saints this weekend, they were able to banish the memories of their losses to Brighton and Brentford by making it two straight victories. ALL EYES ON: New signing Casemiro was brought on in the second half to make his United debut and although it was a brief appearance, he looked sturdy and at ease in midfield. Red Devils fans will be eager to see him involved from the start in their next game. THE MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS:  DID YOU KNOW? Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min are the only players to have scored more goals in the Premier League than Bruno Fernandes since he made his debut in February 2020.

Bayern Munich 'on the home stretch' with Mazraoui transfer from Ajax,"Bayern Munich's move for Noussair Mazraoui is on ""the home stretch"", according to manager Julian Nagelsmann, who applauded the Ajax man as the ""kind of player"" he wants at Allianz Arena. The Morocco international will leave the Netherlands after a trophy-laden stint to join the Bundesliga champions next term on a free transfer. The final matters are still being ironed out, but that has not stopped his new coach from waxing lyrically about their courtship. ""With Mazraoui, we are on the home stretch,"" Nagelsmann stated when asked where the deal stood for the Ajax man. ""There are still final details that need to be clarified. ""If it works out, then we have a very goood player that we're very happy about. I didn't feel like we had to do a lot of convincing. ""The first conversation was that he was extremely on fire, in terms of form, and that he only wanted to play for Bayern. The thing was bagged relatively quickly. Those are the kind of players and conversations we need, players who have that hunger and push other players."" A three-time Eredivisie champion during his time in Amsterdam, the Morocco international is not the only face to leave the club, as boss Erik ten Hag also departs for Manchester United. He leaves behind six honours claimed during his stay at the club, as well as selection for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations during his time with them. In addition, he was named the club's player of the year in 2019.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-home-stretch-mazraoui-transfer-ajax/blt3eb0ef15a8124862,Andrew Steel,5987b553-a6f1-4eb3-abb5-782b3a61d362
Eriksen bags assist in Brentford friendly as Denmark star nears Premier League debut,"Christian Eriksen played an hour and bagged an assist in a closed-doors friendly for Brentford against Southend on Monday, as the Denmark star moved up a gear in pursuit of his Premier League comeback. The former Tottenham and Inter playmaker looks poised to make his competitive Bees debut before the end of February, as he continues to plot a remarkable return to action following his arrival at Brentford Community Stadium. The 30-year-old, who celebrated his birthday alongside his first minutes for Thomas Frank's side, had not played since suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 last summer, but nevertheless turned in a performance that suggested he has not lost his touch in the interim. In the first of what will be at least two warm-up games for the midfielder, Eriksen started for a Brentford XI against the Shrimpers, as the hosts ran out 3-2 winners against their lower-league opposition. The Dane went close to opening the scoring in the early exchanges, before setting up Josh Dasilva for what would be the first of an eventual hat-trick for the latter on his own return from injury. Eriksen was removed on the hour mark, to be replaced by Lewis Gordon, in a pre-planned tactical change, to come through the latest step of his comeback unscathed. With one warm-up game down, Eriksen could theoretically make his debut as early as this weekend, against Arsenal as Brentford look to inflict a surprise result upon the north London outfit. He would likely only feature from the bench for a cameo if he did, however, marking out the Bees' subsequent clash with Newcastle as a more likely debut opportunity for the playmaker. Regardless of which match he ultimately returns in, his mere presence will prove a remarkable achievement for the player, after his career looked to be over in the midst of Euro 2020 last term.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/eriksen-assist-brentford-friendly-nears-premier-league-debut/bltf8a2f97b645341bb,Andrew Steel,fc4f118f-4e13-4be7-9b4f-37d6d9813464
"Ted Lasso episodes: Guide to seasons 1, 2 & 3","Who could have predicted that a series about Ted Lasso, an American football college coach seemingly left out of his depth after trading life in the United States for that as a soccer boss in England, would become an Emmy Award-winning production and the most-watched programme on Apple TV+. That is where we are, with Jason Sudeikis starring in a hit comedy-drama that has earned a cult following while being showered with plaudits and nods for top prizes at the Golden Globes and Guild of America Awards. Lasso‚Äôs exploits with AFC Richmond are quickly becoming the stuff of legend, as fictional characters are compared to professionals in the real world, but what is the series all about and how many episodes have been made? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ WARNING: Spoilers ahead... No. Title Air date Summary 1 Pilot August 14, 2020 Rebecca Welton, the owner of Premier League strugglers AFC Richmond, appoints the most incompetent coach she can find to run the club in a bid to spite her ex-husband. Lasso is drafted in from Kansas City and his new players hate him despite efforts to win them over with his positive attitude. 2 Biscuits August 14, 2020 Lasso attempts to win over his players, while gifting shortbread to Walton as a present ‚Äì a product she becomes obsessed with. Squad harmony remains an issue, with ageing star Roy Kent at odds with youngster Jamie Tartt, while Nigerian player Sam Obisanya is homesick. Lasso is set up in a supposed clinch with Tartt‚Äôs girlfriend, Keeley. 3 Trent Crimm: The Independent August 14, 2020 Lasso meets with a tough reporter from The Independent, Trent Crimm. It emerges that tactics are being devised by kit man, Nate, while Lasso reveals that he places little emphasis on results. Kids at a local school are won over by his charm before a positive story is published in the papers following a first taste of Indian food for Lasso during a meal out with Crimm. 4 For The Children August 21, 2020 The team lose on the field, while Robbie Williams cancels on Welton off it ‚Äì meaning that another music act needs to be found for a charity ball. Kent and Tartt constantly feud and it is discovered that Welton‚Äôs ex-husband is responsible for cancelling Williams, while he shows up his former flame by donating ¬£1 million to charity. Keeley is talked into breaking up with Tartt, while Lasso finds an unknown street performer to provide musical assistance. 5 Tan Lines August 28, 2020 Lasso‚Äôs wife and son arrive from the States, but it becomes apparent that a relationship there is failing and a parting of ways becomes inevitable. On the field, Tartt is refusing to pass to his team-mates as AFC Richmond become a one-man show. Lasso benches a talismanic presence before half-time in one contest, but claims a result to silence any doubters. 6 Two Aces September 4, 2020 A new star arrives in the form of Dani Rojas, who then gets mysteriously injured after becoming an on-field rival for Tartt. Lasso learns that the club‚Äôs treatment room is haunted, leading to him attempting to lift the curse, while Tartt returns to parent club Manchester City as a loan spell is cut short. 7 Make Rebecca Great Again September 11, 2020 Lasso gets drunk on a night out, as he struggles to come to terms with his impending divorce, and snaps at Nate. Following an apology, Nate delivers an inspiring ‚Äì if somewhat insulting ‚Äì pre-match speech ahead of a match at Everton that brings a 60-year winless run against the Toffees to a close. Lasso suffers a panic attack during a post-game karaoke party. 8 The Diamond Dogs September 18, 2020 Lasso creates his ‚ÄòDiamond Dogs‚Äô team of sidekicks, while Kent‚Äôs relationship with Keeley becomes an issue as they are caught on camera kissing by the paparazzi. Lasso wins a wager with Walton‚Äôs ex-husband over a game of darts that stops him from criticising the running of the club. Keeley discovers that Walton had planned to sell a picture of her with Lasso to The Sun. 9 All Apologies September 25, 2020 Lasso initially refuses to bench Kent despite his struggles for form, alienating him from his team-mates, but eventually backtracks on that decision. Welton tells Lasso of her tabloid picture plan, and is surprised at being forgiven so easily. It is determined that injury will be given as the reason for Kent‚Äôs absence from the team, while Lasso maintains that results are not important to him. 10 The Hope That Kills You October 2, 2020 Nate is promoted to coach, while Welton calls on Lasso to cause confusion for rivals in a bid to pick up results. The plan briefly works when equalising against Manchester City from a clever set-play, but Tartt haunts his former club by scoring a match winner. AFC Richmond are relegated, leading to attempts by Lasso to resign, but he is talked around as the club plot immediate promotion and a shot at Premier League title glory. No. Title Air date Summary 11 Goodbye Earl July 23, 2021 Starting mid-season, AFC Richmond have drawn their last seven games before Rojas gets the chance to convert a match-winning penalty. He ends up kicking the club‚Äôs greyhound mascot as he jumps in front of the goal to chase a bird, leading to a loss of confidence and skills. A no-nonsense sports psychologist is hired, whose attitude clashes with Lasso‚Äôs, while Tartt becomes the star of a reality television show. 12 Lavender July 30, 2021 Tartt is voted off ‚ÄòLove Conquers All‚Äô and tries to return to Manchester City, before then approaching Lasso about a second stint at AFC Richmond ‚Äì an offer which is initially declined. Kent becomes a pundit for Sky Sports, where he upsets colleagues with his cursing but earns praise from supporters. Lasso eventually decides to bring Tartt back despite opposition to a deal. 13 Do The Right-est Thing August 6, 2021 Tartt‚Äôs apologies over previous criticism fall on deaf ears. The team‚Äôs sponsor, Dubai Air, causes controversy when Obisanya‚Äôs father reveals to him that they are responsible for polluting air in his homeland. A number of players protest by placing tape over the logo on the front of their shirts. On the pitch, a lengthy sequence of draws is snapped. 14 Carol Of The Bells August 13, 2021 It is Christmas in Richmond, with parties held for the club‚Äôs overseas players. Lasso does not get the call he had hoped for when speaking to his ex-wife and son, leading to him turning to drink, but his mood improves when asked to get involved in some last-minute gift-giving to underprivileged children. 15 Rainbow August 20, 2021 Richmond struggle as captain Isaac McAdoo fails to lead. A game against some neighbourhood footballers helps him to rediscover the joys of playing for fun and he starts to dominate proceedings once more. Kent initially turns down an offer to join Lasso‚Äôs coaching staff, but realises he misses working in the game while appearing on Soccer Saturday and agrees to return to Richmond. 16 The Signal August 27, 2021 Richmond are flying with Kent back on the staff, with even Tartt talking a former foe into giving him advice on how to perform at his best. Unusual tactics bring the best out of Tartt in a FA Cup quarter-final clash with Tottenham, as all of the coaching staff raise their middle finger at him, but Lasso suffers a panic attack and leaves the pitch. Nate inspires victory from the stands, while Dr Sharon is brought in to help Lasso. 17 Headspace September 3, 2021 Lasso commits to therapy following initial scepticism, while Kent works on his relationship with Keeley. Nate becomes a viral sensation following his triple substitution against Spurs, but his father urges humility instead of offering praise. That leads Nate to start treating others unkindly in the dressing room ‚Äì including Colin, a young Welshman that used to bully him, and new kit man Will. 18 Man City September 10, 2021 Richmond play at Wembley for the first time, against Manchester City, but suffer a harsh defeat. Tartt is criticised by his abusive father in the dressing room afterwards, leading to a scuffle. Plenty of relationships elsewhere need to be worked on. 19 Beard After Hours September 17, 2021 Coach Beard gets caught up in a night out with supporters, which leads to trouble ‚Äì including him being beaten by Tartt‚Äôs father and his friends. It is revealed that there is a secret entrance into AFC Richmond‚Äôs stadium, while Beard stumbles across a secret nightclub underneath a church after breaking his key in the door to his apartment. 20 No Weddings And A Funeral September 24, 2021 Lasso suffers another panic attack ahead of the funeral of Welton‚Äôs father. Welton, instead of giving a eulogy to a parent that she saw cheating on her mother as a child, leads the congregation in a rendition of ‚ÄòNever Going To Give You Up‚Äô. After the service, Tartt reveals to Keeley that he still loves her. 21 Midnight Train To Royston October 1, 2021 Obisanya scores the first hat-trick of his career, leading to a Ghanaian billionaire visiting Richmond and offering to buy him for Raja Casablanca ‚Äì a side he is looking to take over and bring in the best African talent. Kent and Keeley both admit to spending time with others outside of their relationship. Lasso learns that his panic attack is set to make the papers, with it revealed that Nate is the source tipping off the press. 22 Inverting The Pyramid Of Success October 8, 2021 Lasso has the full backing of the club ahead of their final game of the season. Welton‚Äôs ex-husband buys West Ham United. Nate tries to abandon a false nine approach, but is ignored by the players. Rojas converts a penalty that seals promotion back to the Premier League. Obisanya agrees to remain with Richmond, but a couple of months later Nate is unveiled as the newest members of West Ham‚Äôs coaching team.  It was revealed in October 2020 that there would be a third series of Ted Lasso. That began production in March 2022, with AFC Richmond joining forces with Nike. The first trailer for Season 3 was released on February 14, 2023 and it premiered exclusively on Apple TV+ on March 15, 2023.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ted-lasso-episodes/blt41e4c4c21170c744,Chris Burton,fcb93f37-da2e-42fd-b431-04568e41a952
Man Utd confirm Maguire as captain despite highly criticised form,"Harry Maguire will remain captain of Manchester United for the 2022-23 season, Erik ten Hag has confirmed. The centre-back faced heavy criticism for his performances last term, with many questioning his leadership qualities, but the new coach insists he is the right choice for the role and has explained his decision. The objections to Maguire's captaincy and the arrival of the Dutch manager resulted in speculation that the armband would be passed on to someone else. However, Ten Hag clarified on Monday that the England international would continue as the leader of the Red Devils. ""Harry Maguire is the captain,"" Ten Hag said at a press conference.  ""Of course, I have to get to know all the players and it takes time, but he is an established captain for a few years and he has achieved a lot of success, so I don't doubt about this issue."" Maguire faced intense criticism throughout United's disappointing 2021-22 campaign under previous coaches Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. The 29-year-old's performance in United's 4-1 thrashing at the hands of rivals Manchester City in March stood out and resulted in many calling for him to be stripped of the captaincy. His former Hull City team-mate Ahmed Elmohamady insisted days after that match that Maguire ""can't handle this pressure"" that comes with the role and called for Cristiano Ronaldo to take it on next season. Meanwhile, ex-United captain Nemanja Vidic called for him to be dropped from the team because of his damaged confidence. However, Rio Ferdinand came to Maguire's defence as he highlighted his ""phenomenal"" performances for England but stressed that United do not play to his strengths. Maguire was also targeted by supporters while on international duty with England, with many jeering the defender in April. Maguire even had to get the police involved at one stage as he received a bomb threat that same month.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-confirm-maguire-as-captain-despite-highly-criticised/bltcdecb4234cdfd517,Peter McVitie,a852307c-906a-4876-b0cd-96b87ea9faa9
Neymar sends message to booing PSG fans: I'm here for three more years!,"Neymar has sent a message to Paris Saint-Germain fans after they booed the team during their Ligue 1 title-clinching match on Saturday, with the winger telling critics to pace themselves as he's not leaving the club anytime soon. PSG players have been jeered at home ever since they crashed out of the Champions League against Real Madrid on March 9, and Neymar has received some of the harshest verbal attacks from supporters. Rather than shy away from the negative attention, the Brazilian has reacted head-on to the disruptive atmosphere at Parc des Princes. ""I still have a contract with Paris Saint-Germain,"" he told ESPN Argentina after PSG's 1-1 draw with Lens on Saturday, which was good enough to clinch the Ligue 1 title. ""I'm here for three more years, so stop [booing] or you'll need more air."" Neymar told PSG fans to pace themselves üò¨ pic.twitter.com/3UYkaZlyV4 PSG players received some of the loudest boos against Lens when they entered half-time tied at 0-0. After the game, fans prematurely emptied out Parc des Princes despite trophy celebrations. This was far from the first time Neymar has received jeers from his own crowd. Previously, he reacted by posting family photos to social media. Midfielder Marco Verratti was not happy with the reception on Sunday, telling Canal+: ""The fans who did not celebrate? It's something I don't understand. It's football, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. We are normal people, we can have failures. But the 10th title is important."" Kylian Mbappe, meanwhile, tried not to let the fans bother him. ""We celebrated among ourselves,"" he said. ""We were able to put ourselves in a safe place very early in the season and we were never worried by any competitor. So we're very happy. ""Nobody spoils my pleasure. We make a lot of sacrifices and we want to leave our name in history. There are always circumstances in a season and this is one of them. Personally, [the fan reaction] doesn't affect me. I was very happy to win."" Despite a chaotic 2021-22 season, PSG have now managed to do what they failed to accomplish last year in winning Ligue 1, and they've done so in resounding fashion. The players want to use that as a positive launching pad for next term, even as fans have become unsettled with the overall results from the high-spending outfit.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-sends-message-to-booing-psg-fans-i-m-here-for-three/blt662b567c286c028c,Dan Bernstein,3116e40e-1063-4609-a738-b1e3489b0a24
Afcon stampede: Caf ring questionable venue changes ,"Three Africa Cup of Nations matches will change venues in light of Monday‚Äôs deadly stadium stampede at the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe, according to a Confederation of African Football statement as seen by GOAL, although it‚Äôs the Stade Japoma in Douala that has been the hardest hit by the rescheduling. A stampede outside the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe on Monday evening, ahead of Cameroon‚Äôs Round of 16 meeting with the Comoros, resulted in eight deaths, with 38 people injured, seven of whom are in serious condition. In a press conference on Tuesday, Caf President Dr Patrice Motsepe announced that the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe would not be permitted to host any further Africa Cup of Nations matches until assurances had been given regarding safety measures in place at the arena. However, the site of Monday‚Äôs tragedy isn‚Äôt the only venue to be affected by the fixture changes announced on Wednesday, with the Stade Japoma in Douala losing two matches to Olembe‚Äôs one. The quarter-final‚Äîscheduled for Olembe on January 30‚Äîhas been moved to Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in the centre of the capital, Yaounde, while two of the three matches that were still to be played in Douala have been removed from the city. Both the 30 January quarter-final in Douala, and the February 2 semi-final scheduled for the country‚Äôs economic capital have been taken away from the city‚Äîdespite there being no security issues reported at Stade Japoma during the competition‚Äîand relocated to the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo. Douala will still host the January 29 quarter-final between Cameroon and Gambia. Despite the deaths at Olembe on Monday, the stadium is still due to host the second semi-final‚Äîwhich will feature the winner of Cameroon vs Gambia‚Äîon Thursday February 3, as well as the final three days later. While Japoma has not been at the centre of any security concerns during the seven matches it has hosted so far, it has come under scrutiny due to the state of the pitch, although the teams who have played at the venue have described the playing surface as passable. Caf have also reiterated their desire to get to the bottom of the circumstances that led to Monday‚Äôs deadly crush, and reaffirmed that no further matches will be played at Olembe until guarantees can be made about the venue‚Äôs safety. ‚ÄúThe next match that was scheduled for the Olembe Stadium will not take place until CAF and the Local Organising Committee have received the full report of the Investigation Committee (into the Olembe incident) indicating the circumstances and events that led to the injury and death of spectators at the Olembe Stadium,‚Äù read a statement as seen by GOAL. ‚ÄúThe Caf Afcon Organising Committee also requires the assurance and guarantee that appropriate and adequate interventions and measures have been implemented to ensure that a similar incident will not occur at the Olembe Stadium during the TotalEnergies Afcon Cameroon 2021.‚Äù Caf are yet to clarify why original plans to move the 30 January quarter-final‚Äîinvolving Senegal‚Äîfrom Douala to Limbe have been shelved.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-stampede-caf-ring-questionable-afcon-changes/blt6c10d0449bf2ef74,Ed Dove,0a61728d-8164-4660-a760-650389323e96
Olivia Moultrie: Record-breaking USWNT hopeful set on world domination,"When Olivia Moultrie was just seven years old, she sat down, created a list of goals and, effectively, planned out the rest of her life. At the time, she was a lot like every other seven-year-old that kicks a ball, and had the same ambitions as many her age. Number one: She wanted to be a professional soccer player. Number two: Win championships. Number three: Win a World Cup. And number four: Be the best player in the world. In a way, on the day she made that list and set those goals for herself, Moultrie's childhood ended. Every moment, every choice, every lawsuit, every training session and every game has been geared towards that fourth goal. Now 16, Moultrie can already say that she has completed her primary goal of becoming a professional. In fact, she completed it three years ago, when she signed her first pro contract and rocketed into the spotlight as American soccer's latest prodigy. This is ridiculous from @olivia_moultrie ü§©ü§©üé• @NWSL pic.twitter.com/hN84BEGUiH Soccer in the United States has never encountered a player like Moultrie, a young girl who is so singularly determined and passionate, while also personable and thoughtful. She is probably the most atypical 16-year-old athlete on the planet and, more than likely, the most self-aware. Nothing Moultrie does is normal because the normal kids don't become the best soccer players in the world; the extraordinary ones do. ""I'm just living that professional soccer player life,"" Moultrie tells GOAL in an exclusive interview, ""and sometimes other people have to pull me back and be like, 'What you're doing, it's crazy.' My dad all the time just stops me and says it's amazing. ""I get so caught up in the moment of just like, I just want more and more and more, and that's what I'm working for every day. ""Sometimes, I have to have family members kind of pull me back and be like, 'Liv you're only 16.' ""It's crazy, but I want everything to happen so fast."" Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Fast is an understatement. In the years since making her list, Moultrie has become the youngest to achieve just about everything you can achieve in American soccer without playing for the senior national team, establishing herself as a trailblazing prodigy that has fans of all generations hailing her as a role model. She committed to the University of North Carolina at age 11, and promptly backed out of that to become a professional at 13. By 15, she and her family had sued the NWSL, alleging that the league violated the Sherman Antitrust Act with the age limit that was preventing her from playing. Before turning 16, she had won that lawsuit, made her NWSL debut, made her first start and scored her first professional goal. Now, in a year where she should be focusing on getting her driver's license, Moultrie is focused on what she can do to help the Portland Thorns win an NWSL title. She has featured a total of 19 times for the Thorns and is now preparing for the Under-20 World Cup, where she will join the U.S. as far and away the youngest member of the squad. ""I don't want the regular 16-year-old life,"" she says. ""That's why I chose this path. I don't want to really think like, 'Oh, I'm missing out on this' because, no, this is all I've ever wanted. ""And now I am 'living the dream'. I love what I'm doing and that's why I chose to go into this and just jump all the way in."" Moultrie, though, does understand she is missing out on some foundational experiences, the ones that define life for most people her age. She's missing the weekend hangouts, the school dances, the pep rallies, those quiet moments where she can be just like every other 16-year-old. Her family does, though, try to give her some taste of normalcy. ""I love being a sister,"" she says. ""I have two younger sisters and that's a huge part of my life too. That's kind of my view of like, the norm, you know? ""Seeing them in their lives and emailing colleges and working towards what they want, it's been really cool for me to see that. ""I have an amazing family who support me and that's always a big thing that I love to tell the world because they deserve a lot of love for that. They've been behind me and I'm really appreciative of that."" Moultrie is also appreciative of the help she has received along the way from team-mates who, whether willingly or unwillingly, were thrust into older sister roles the moment she showed up in Portland. Christine Sinclair, Lindsey Horan, Tobin Heath, Emily Sonnett, Meghan Klingenberg... Moultrie rattles off the names of those that have, at one point or another, taken her under their wing. ""I wanted to latch on and grab all of the experience they had and just ask all these questions,"" she says. ""What's that kind of life like for them? Because that's what I want."" Like her team-mates, Moultrie has rapidly turned into a role model herself. It's a bit of an unusual phenomenon. One look at Moultrie's social media pages produces a variety of responses, most that would normally be directed at World Cup winners, not teenagers. ""My daughters adore you,"" reads one. ""Thank you for being such a great role model"", another says. One final one: ""The young woman that changed women's football in the U.S."" It can be overwhelming, but in the age of social media, it's not something Moultrie could necessarily avoid, even if she wanted to. Not that she does. She likes being an example, a leader, a role model, much like the women she grew up idolizing. ""I never went into this thinking that or hoping that people are going to look up to me and I'm going to be a role model,"" she says.

"Borussia Dortmund vs Bayern Munich: Predictions, odds & betting tips","The latest instalment of Der Klassiker takes place on Saturday evening as Borussia Dortmund host Bayern Munich in a meeting of the top two sides in the Bundesliga. Bayern head into the clash a point ahead of their rivals but Dortmund's home record is formidable. The fans at Signal Iduna Park have seen their side win their last 11 consecutive home league matches and bet365 price a Dortmund victory at  3/1 (4.00).Bayern, meanwhile, have won each of the last six editions of this fixture in all competitions and can be backed at 3/4 (1.75) with the draw at 10/3 (4.33). His form may not have been enough to claim the Ballon d'Or, yet Robert Lewandowski has been sensational in the final third, netting 14 times in 13 league games this season. The Polish forward can be backed at 11/4 (3.75) to open the scoring against his former club, ahead of Erling Haaland who is offered at 4/1 (5.00). Serge Gnabry, meanwhile, is offered at 13/2 (7.50) while Donyell Malen can be backed at 8/1 (9.00). Dortmund finished 14 points behind their Bavarian rivals last season, and while they may still end the campaign a good distance off the pace, currently Marco Rose's side are keeping up in impressive fashion. Naturally it helps to have the scoring prowess of a player like Erling Haaland, yet Dortmund have goals all over the pitch with 11 different scorers this term and they have netted in 24 consecutive home Bundesliga matches. Bayern for their part have scored in every Bundesliga game they have contested since February 16, 2020 and can always be relied upon for goals seemingly irrespective of the opponent. Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals is priced at 1/2 (1.50) which looks like a nailed-on selection but is probably too short a price for a stand-alone bet. Instead consider backing Bayern to score in both halves at evens (2.00) which looks a shrewd way to invest in a game with plenty of goals. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.      ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/borussia-dortmund-vs-bayern-munich-predictions-odds-and/bltbf13efdce2600d6f,Phil Kitromilides,80e3c715-9f46-420f-a4b6-30a153546b8e

Who is Lionel Messi's agent? Who looks after the interests of PSG‚Äôs former Barcelona superstar?,"Lionel Messi is one of the most recognisable figures on the planet, with the seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner establishing a reputation over the course of spells at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain that has allowed his celebrity status to transcend sport. He is a marketing dream, given his profile around the world, and has worked on some of the most lucrative contracts that football has ever seen ‚Äì with leading sides in Spain and France prepared to spend big in order to benefit from his remarkable skill set. Who, though, manages Messi‚Äôs career behind the scenes and fills an agency role that allows the all-time great to prosper on the field? GOAL takes a look... Messi‚Äôs path to the very top of the global game started out in humble beginnings in Rosario, Argentina at local side Grandoli. His father, Jorge, coached the precociously-gifted talent at that stage, before a step up was taken to Newell‚Äôs Old Boys. At 13 years of age it became clear that Messi was going to require hormone injections for a growth deficiency disorder and, despite not being poor, his family realised that assistance was going to be required in footing those bills. Jorge reached out to Barcelona and organised a trial for his son in Catalunya, becoming his representative in the process. Neither could have imagined what the future would hold at that stage, but Messi has always been close to his father and trusts him implicitly to look after his best interests on and off the field. Jorge told Kicker in 2013: ‚Äú(Leo) always followed what I said to him as his coach. ""Even today he is still like that. He has never told me, 'I‚Äôm grown up and the best player in the world'. ""The other day I mentioned a couple of things to him. I‚Äôm still the same as a father as when I was his coach at Grandoli."" The Messis famously signed a deal with Barcelona on a napkin, with that agreement said to be worth ¬£120,000 a year while the Liga heavyweights also agreed to take care of any medical costs. On this day 20 years ago Lionel Messi was offered his first Barcelona contract... on a napkin üìù pic.twitter.com/7CEhqxTn3Z A meteoric rise was enjoyed from that point, with a senior debut at Camp Nou taken in by the talented youngster in October 2004 ‚Äì shortly after agreeing a first professional at the age of 16. Those terms were thrashed out by Jorge, who went on to oversee several more renewals before a final deal with Barca was signed in 2017 that was reportedly worth just under ¬£500 million ($654m). Another lucrative agreement was put in place when bidding an emotional farewell to Catalunya in 2021 and packing bags for a new adventure in France. Messi‚Äôs terms at PSG are said to be worth ‚Ç¨30m a year (¬£25m/$33m) across his debut campaign at Parc des Princes and ‚Ç¨40m (¬£33m/$44m) in any seasons after that ‚Äì with a ‚Ç¨15m loyalty bonus also reportedly being paid out on an annual basis. It remains to be seen how long the mercurial South American will stick around in the French capital, after becoming a target for terrace taunts, and there is already talk of Jorge reaching out to Barca regarding a possible retracing of steps. Jorge has helped to oversee the construction of a Messi brand that now extends into just about every corner of sporting, retail, sponsorship and gaming life. The family also have three ‚ÄòMiM‚Äô branded hotels in Sitges, Ibiza and Mallorca ‚Äì although those establishments are managed by the Majestic Hotel Group. In football circles, Jorge‚Äôs time is taken up ensuring that Lionel‚Äôs every whim is taken care of, with there little opportunity or need for him to get involved with anybody else. Rodrigo Messi has, however, sought to enter the football agency game by becoming an advisor to young players seeking to tread a similar path to his famous brother. He did spend time working with La Masia graduates during Lionel‚Äôs time at Barcelona and publicly billed himself as Ansu Fati‚Äôs agent before another home-grown star at Camp Nou joined the books of Jorge Mendes‚Äô agency in 2020.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-is-lionel-messi-agent-psg-barcelona-superstar/bltdb5057eb2450e43e,Chris Burton,d5dfd465-0e05-4f59-b8de-3c88df1eaa66

Jozy Altidore seals New England Revolution transfer through to 2024,"New England Revolution have signed striker Jozy Altidore on a deal through 2024, capturing the USMNT international via free agency ahead of the 2022 Major League Soccer campaign. The veteran forward, a two-time U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year, arrives at Gillette Stadium following seven seasons with Toronto FC, with whom he was a three-time MLS Cup finalist, winning in 2017. Altidore, also an international centurion with 115 senior caps for his country since 2007, has suffered a few injury-blighted seasons at BMO Field in recent years, but will hope to rediscover his superior form under Bruce Arena, with the pair having previously won the 2017 Gold Cup together. ‚ÄúI am excited to begin this next chapter with the Revolution and look forward to competing for trophies in New England,‚Äù Altidore told the club's official website. ‚ÄúI am grateful for this opportunity to reunite with Bruce Arena and look forward to getting to work with my team-mates immediately.‚Äù Arena echoed his sentiments, adding: ‚ÄúWe welcome Jozy Altidore to the New England Revolution. Jozy is a player we know well and feel confident that he will be an excellent addition to our team. ""I believe Jozy can continue to be an outstanding goalscorer, and we will work hard to get him back to full fitness and in good form over the next couple of months.‚Äù Altidore's move south of the border to Foxborough signals the end of a fruitful tenure at Toronto where the 32-year-old effectively established himself as one of the league's most appreciated players following a lacklustre seven-year spell abroad. Having broken through at New York Red Bulls, a 2008 move to Villarreal as a teenager failed to yield a serious breakthrough in La Liga, with loan spells at Xerez, Hull City and Bursaspor delivering minimal results. A famed KNVB Cup triumph with AZ in the Netherlands in 2013 effectively helped reignite his prospects and - following a muted spell at Sunderland - he returned to MLS where he flourished with the Reds. Even with hit-and-miss domestic success, he was a key cornerstone of successive USMNT sides across the last decade, named in their squads for both South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014 - and helping them to a Gold Cup triumph in 2017 against Jamaica too.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/jozy-altidore-new-england-revolution-transfer-2024/bltc7fc5af5c824fd2d,Andrew Steel,b3fbe32d-4609-4f37-944b-c656524e8813
Lukaku and Christensen hooked and Rudiger injured: Arsenal defeat shows scale of Chelsea's summer problems,"Chelsea's 4-2 home defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday threw up a host of different issues facing any new owners when they finally purchase the club.¬† Manager Thomas Tuchel had to ring the changes in his 55th match of the season after an FA Cup semi-final victory against Crystal Palace on Sunday.¬† It was a chance for the fringe players in his squad to step up and, unfortunately for them, it did not go well.¬† Up front, Romelu Lukaku earned his first league start for Chelsea in two months. On his last start, he broke the Premier League record for fewest touches in a match over 90 minutes, managing just seven touches of the ball at Selhurst Park.¬† Although he was more involved this time around, he had just the one shot and two touches in Arsenal's box before being substituted in the 60th minute.¬† As he came off, there was a smattering of boos from the East Stand next to the bench. ""Maybe you must ask the fans,‚Äù Tuchel said when quizzed about the reaction. ‚ÄúYou heard it so you need to ask the people.‚Äù The Belgium superstar may also have been, in small part, at fault for the team's general poor defensive display. FT: Chelsea 2-4 ArsenalIt sounds like a classic, indeed it was for Arsenal, but it was more like a school yard match. Entertaining nonetheless. Chelsea's Champions League spot cushion is down to 5 points with West Ham and Man United up next. #CFC #CHEARS The Blues' pressing system involves all 10 outfield players. While they may have created two goals for Cesar Azpilicueta and Timo Werner, they could not protect their own goal.¬† It was Barcelona-bound Andreas Christensen at fault for the opening goal; his lax pass back to Edouard Mendy cut out by Eddie Nketiah who made it 1-0.¬† After their first equaliser, the Blues were weak in midfield, allowing Granit Xhaka to drive from his side's own box into the opposition half. Eventually, after some soft defending, Emile Smith Rowe curled in a second. The Chelsea supporters began chanting for Thiago Silva, who was left on the bench, to resolve the issues, while also perhaps sending a message to Christensen who opted not to renew his contract in west London.¬† ‚ÄúHe said he cannot continue so I think he had some problems,"" Tuchel said when asked by GOAL about withdrawing Christensen at half-time.¬† ""I don‚Äôt take a player out because he makes one mistake. To say the pitch is difficult to play here, it maybe sounds like an excuse but it is a very, very difficult pitch that we have here. It‚Äôs not in our favour. The ball bounces very awkwardly in front of Andreas when he wants to play this ball."" With the legendary Brazilian defender on the pitch, things did not improve drastically.¬† Goalscorer Azpilicueta was at fault for both the third and fourth goals. For the third, he gave the ball away in midfield and allowed Nketiah a chance to dominate both Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr to score.¬† For the fourth, he bafflingly fouled Bukayo Saka off the ball but in the penalty area. The young England international netted from the spot to secure victory. After that, the club captain was seen arguing with a supporter and could himself follow Christensen to join Xavi at Camp Nou in the summer.¬† The Catalan club have had extensive talks with him already but the Blues have utilised a clause in his deal to extend it by a year. Sarr, meanwhile, was in the starting line-up due to a minor groin injury to star defender Antonio Rudiger.¬† ""We conceded seven goals with Toni against Brentford and Real Madrid, that answers the question,"" Tuchel said of his defensive changes. ""It's not about individual players."" Tuchel has played Rudiger in 47 matches and for 4,380 minutes this season. The Germany international has played 600 more minutes than any other player, the goalkeepers included.¬† The manager was ready to make Rudiger the club's highest-paid defender in history before sanctions were imposed. The club can no longer offer him that contract as they consider potential new owners and Manchester United, Real Madrid, PSG and Juventus are among clubs looking to take advantage of the situation.¬† This match showed what Chelsea would be missing without Rudiger and, even more so, with other issues still plaguing the backline.¬† Chelsea remains massively ahead in the race for the top four, but will find bigger issues come the summer.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-christensen-hooked-rudiger-injured-arsenal-defeat-chelsea-/blt58b17113eb674f85,Nizaar Kinsella,b0baa3f2-1012-472e-8d21-20157d98930e

"Ajax vs Benfica: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Ajax and Benfica go head-to-head in Amsterdam on Tuesday to determine who will progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The two sides played out a 2-2 draw in Lisbon as Ajax twice threw away a lead in the first leg. The home side expect to improve on their strong performance in the previous fixture, but their defence has been unstable since then despite winning their last three matches. Benfica, meanwhile, are unbeaten since the first clash but were held to a surprising draw by Vizela at the weekend. Ajax are favourites to win the clash at the Johan Cruiff Arena, with bet365 offering them at 4/11 (1.36). Benfica, on the other hand, are priced at 6/1 (7.00) with the draw offered at 9/2 (5.50). Ajax hero Sebastien Haller has been in incredible form in the Champions League this season, having scored 11 goals so far. He can be backed at 10/3 (4.33) to break the deadlock against Benfica, while fellow star Dusan Tadic is available at 5/1 (5.00). Darwin Nunez is the lowest-priced Benfica player to net the first goal at 8/1 (9.0) and Goncalo Ramos is 10/1 (11.00) to score first. Despite holding on to their place at the top of the Eredivisie and booking a place in the KNVB Beker final, Ajax have had a difficult couple of weeks since the first leg. They suffered a shock defeat to Go Ahead Eagles and had close calls against RKC Waalwijk and Cambuur, but managed to scrape wins in both games. Benfica, meanwhile, have also been in fine goalscoring form in recent weeks and are unbeaten in seven matches in all competitions. However, the Portuguese side's defence has hardly impressed, either, and they slipped further behind Primeira Liga leaders Porto with an unexpected draw on Friday.  There have been plenty of goals in recent matches for both Ajax and Benfica and backing the match to have over 2.5 goals at 1/3 (1.33) looks appealing.

Bayer Leverkusen most expensive player sales - How Werkself made almost ‚Ç¨600 million in outgoing transfers,"If you're an up and coming talent looking for a career springboard, then Bayer Leverkusen isn't the worst choice.  This is evident by the Werkself's transfer record, with numerous young players earning a big-money move after impressing at Leverkusen. Leverkusen may not win title after title, but as a regular in the Champions League, the club offers its players the opportunity to test themselves regularly on Europe's biggest stage. There have been several players who have managed to attract the attention of some of the finest clubs in the world with their performances for Leverkusen, helping the Bundesliga side fill their coffers. Six of the top seven sales by Leverkusen were no older than 23 when they left the club and with players like Hakan Calhanoglu, Heung-Min Son and Kai Havertz, there have certainly been some high-profile names who came through the ranks at Bayer.

Mbappe set to leave while Messi and Neymar have flopped - what next for PSG and their star-studded front three?,"Paris Saint-Germain have made a habit of crashing out in the Champions League in remarkable circumstances, but even by their standards, Wednesday‚Äôs 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid takes some beating. In 2017, the Parisians somehow blew a 4-0 aggregate lead to crash out to a Neymar-inspired Barcelona. The legend of 'La Remontada' was born. Five years and one day later, they suffered a second defeat in Spain that was, in many ways, even more incredible. For an hour, PSG looked impressive. Kylian Mbappe‚Äôs second goal of the tie, in the first half of the second leg, came from the type of chance that PSG readily created in the opening period.¬† They might have been two or three goals clear on the night such was their control over the game. Madrid started the second half with greater intensity, but there was little suggestion they would manufacture a route back into the tie until Gianluigi Donnarumma dallied over a clearance, presenting a simple chance for Vinicius Junior to set up Benzema to level. From there, PSG‚Äôs meltdown was almost total. Indeed, had Madrid scored a brilliant opener, it would not have served them nearly so well. The very act of conceding the cheapest of goals was enough to reopen mental wounds that have not healed at PSG for five years.¬† Remontada II was on. There was a strong spell of possession in which they did not allow Madrid a touch, but that was the only period of the closing 30 minutes in which it seemed PSG might avoid the ghosts of Barcelona. Neymar, Mbappe and Lionel Messi virtually vanished from the match, and Benzema came to the fore to complete a remarkable hat-trick. He was, however, aided by some miserable defending from the visitors. It was most evident after the second goal. There were only 12 seconds between kick-off and Marquinhos‚Äô hashed clearance that dropped to Benzema at the end of the box, which the Frenchman instantly fired into the corner of the net. Unlike in Barcelona, there were still 12 minutes plus stoppage time in which to somehow conjure an equaliser. It never looked like coming. Instead, it was Madrid who looked more likely to score the fifth goal of a remarkable night. The defensive errors kept coming, and the home side threatened to add to the avalanche of goals. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible not to talk about this big mistake,‚Äù Pochettino told Canal+ after the game. Rather than blaming Donnarumma, though, he was pointing his finger at the officials for an apparent foul on the goalkeeper in the build up to the opening goal. ‚ÄúFor 60 minutes we dominated Real; this goal changed everything. ‚ÄúI wonder what VAR does.‚Äù Compared to the team that played in Barcelona on that fateful night in 2017, only Marquinhos and Marco Verratti started this game. The scars of old, though, remain etched on the very fibre of the club. Since then, PSG have drafted in all kinds of star players to help them overcome this issue. Gianluigi Buffon and Dani Alves, serial winners at the highest level, have tried and failed, while this new generation, including the most star-studded front line to ever grace a football field have flopped. Mbappe, Neymar and Messi have proven tactically impossible to work with, and it is worrying for PSG that the only one of this trio who has truly pulled his weight this season is the only one likely to leave. Neymar and Messi, remember, have combined for just six Ligue 1 goals this season. When the chips were down at Santiago Bernabeu, they were unable to influence the game. Only Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs 2020 PSG team, who reached the final behind closed doors, only to lose to Bayern Munich, showed the collective mental fortitude worthy of a team that might go all the way. The German was sacked four months later and led Chelsea to the Champions League crown the following spring. Now will come the usual Champions League post-mortem for PSG, which will be longer and more forensic that ever before. Pochettino will be the inevitable victim.

'Dybala thought he was the new Messi' - Allegri urges departing Juventus star 'to go back to being himself',"Massimiliano Allegri says Paulo Dybala thought he was ""the new Lionel Messi"" earlier in his Juventus career, and has urged the departing forward ""to go back to being himself"". Dybala has spent seven trophy-laden years on Juve's books, scoring 115 goals in 293 appearances to establish himself among Europe's elite attackers. The 28-year-old will move on to a new challenge when his contract expires on June 30, having bid a tearful goodbye to the Bianconeri faithful on the final day of the 2021-22 Serie A season following failed contract negotiations with the club. Dybala's output in the final third dropped at Juve in the last couple of seasons, with his inconsistent form coinciding with a rough patch for the club. Allegri thinks the Argentine got too caught up with trying to follow in the footsteps of Paris Saint-Germain star Messi, who he plays with at international level, and has warned him he has to rediscover his own personal identity in order to get back to his best. The Juve head coach told DAZN: ""Dybala has to go back to being himself.¬†There was a moment when he got carried away by being the new Messi.¬† ""You cannot copy or emulate someone else.¬†Paulo has a lot to give to football, he has extraordinary technical qualities, but he has to go back to focusing on the latter."" Juve finished fourth in Serie A this term and failed to win a trophy for the first time in ten years, with Milan clinching the Scudetto ahead of 2020-21 champions Inter. Allegri won five league titles in his first stint in charge at Allianz Stadium but has faced plenty of criticism since returning to the managerial hot seat last summer. He does not feel Juve need to make wholesale changes this summer, though, as he added on their final Serie A position: ""Milan, Inter and Napoli finished ahead of us in the standings but they were not superior to us.  ""We lacked something in terms of character or management."" Allegri went on to reveal he is still eager to return Juve to the top in both domestic and European competition. ""I had set myself the challenge of returning.¬†A challenge that I want to win together with the club and the fans, returning to triumph in Italy and in Europe,"" he said.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dybala-new-messi-allegri-juventus/blt4e6c8f9cebccb68f,James Westwood,7bc5bbbb-c6af-4ab4-a7b9-e09523318544
'Never will I let someone speak for me' - Lukaku hits out after agent suggests Chelsea exit,"Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku insist he was the only one who would make decisions on his future following suggestions that he could leave Stamford Bridge this summer.  The striker's agent Federico Pastorello appeared to leave the door open to a move during an interview with La Repubblica.  But Lukaku claims that nobody else had the right to talk in his name while he is focused on matters on the field.  ""Never ever will I let someone speak for me,"" he fired on social media.  ""I kept my mouth shut and focused on helping the team and end the season in the best way possible.  So if someone out there trying to say something about me and the club... not in my name.""  ‚ÄúGiven the transfer parameters, nobody could expect this situation,‚Äù the star's agent Pastorello had affirmed. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt discuss technical choices, but it‚Äôs clear that there is a problem.

Have Man City ever won a cup in Europe? Premier League club's continental record,"Manchester City have enjoyed considerable success on the domestic front in England since the arrival of Sheikh Mansour as the club‚Äôs owner in 2008, but the Premier League heavyweights are still waiting on a first Champions League crown. Big money has been invested in the pursuit of an elusive title, with the likes of Roberto Mancini, Manuel Pellegrini and Pep Guardiola being charged with the task of getting the Blues over that line. The expectation is that ultimate glory will be savoured at some stage, but have City claimed a European trophy in the past and what is their overall record in continental competition? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ While Manchester City have never got their hands on European Cup or Champions League honours, they are not waiting to break a continental duck. It has, however, been over 50 years since they last claimed a piece of major silverware outside of domestic competition. They may have won five Premier League titles in the last decade, with another being chased down in the present, but success away from home has proved harder to come by. Guardiola is hoping to buck that trend as he works on a contract through to 2024, but it is the legendary Joe Mercer that remains the last City boss to deliver a European trophy. He achieved that feat in 1969-70 with a squad that included the iconic figures of Blues heroes Joe Corrigan, Willie Donachie, Colin Bell, Stan Bowles, Francis Lee and Mike Summerbee.

Zinchenko moved to tears as Everton & Man City fans unite to show support for Ukraine,"Manchester City's Ukraine full-back Oleksandr Zinchenko was moved to tears during a touching moment on Saturday, as he was given a rousing welcome to Goodison Park by Everton fans in the build-up to the clubs' Premier League clash. The world has been rocked in recent days by Russia's military incursion on Ukrainian soil. Players such as Zinchenko and Everton's Vitaly Mykolenko have moved to express their rejection of the invasion, and both came together at Goodison Park to show their unity. City visited Everton on Saturday looking to get back to winning ways in the Premier League after losing to Tottenham last weekend. Before the game, though, football and its rivalries took a backseat.

'William is incredibly calm' - Deschamps praises Saliba after France debut,"Didier Deschamps was happy with William Saliba's performance in his first appearance for France. Saliba made his debut when he came off the bench just before the hour mark as France ran out 2-1 winners against Ivory Coast. There was a mixed atmosphere at the Stade Velodrome on Friday night as a section of the home fans whistled at Paris Saint-Germain duo Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappe. As a Marseille player, Saliba was playing on home soil and given a rousing reception, and Deschamps had no concerns about his state of mind.

"Ncikazi after Orlando Pirates‚Äô Al Ahli Tripoli win: I‚Äôm greedy, but gracious","Orlando Pirates co-coach Mandla Ncikazi was pleased with the Caf Confederation Cup win over Al Ahli Tripoli on Sunday evening, but felt his side could have won by more goals. While the Buccaneers will now be favourites to book their spot in the final, Ncikazi has warned his charges against complacency in the second leg in Johannesburg this coming Sunday. ‚ÄúThe game is not over, it‚Äôs half time.

Mane to Bayern: Why Bundesliga has to have 'big name' Liverpool star with Haaland gone & Lewandowski going,"Sadio Mane continues to be heavily linked with a summer transfer to Bayern Munich, and Lothar Matthaus is hoping that a deal can be done for another ‚Äúbig name‚Äù as the Bundesliga is preparing to part with Robert Lewandowski after already losing Erling Haaland to Manchester City. With star turns taking their considerable talent elsewhere, the reigning German champions are looking to fight back by putting a big-money agreement in place with Liverpool for a highly-rated Senegalese forward. Mane is approaching the final 12 months of his contract at Anfield, with no extension on the cards, and Matthaus is eager to see a man that has hit 120 goals while collecting Premier League and Champions League honours on Merseyside pack his bags for Bavaria in a busy window of high-profile activity. The 30-year-old, who savoured Africa Cup of Nations glory with his country earlier this year and has entered the debate regarding potential Ballon d‚ÄôOr winners in 2022, has achieved just about everything at Liverpool. He is now mulling over whether or not to take on a new challenge, with Matthaus eager to point out that Bayern need players of his pedigree amid the speculation linking Lewandowski with Barcelona. The former Bayern captain has said when asked if Mane will end up at the Allianz Arena: ‚ÄúI hope so. He's a big name in football and he has shown it for Senegal and Liverpool. He has a lot of speed and can score goals. ‚ÄúThe Bundesliga lost Haaland and we might lose Lewandowski. We need big faces for the logo and brand of Bundesliga. ‚ÄúAnd we will be happy if he signs for Bayern. I am an ex-Bayern player. It will be good for Bayern and Bundesliga.‚Äù Sadio Mane's farewell to Liverpool? ü•∫ pic.twitter.com/toIL20LQN1 The Senegal international had vowed to make a public statement on his future after taking in a Champions League final appearance for Liverpool against Real Madrid on May 28. GOAL was able to confirm at the time that Mane was preparing to inform those at Anfield of his desire to move on, with Bayern quickly moving to the front of a recruitment queue. The man himself went on to state that he would bow to the wishes of the people of Senegal, with it suggested that those back in his homeland want him to move on. Mane has since backtracked on those comments, while Bayern have admitted to exploring alternative options. Sports director Hasan Salihamidzic has told BILD of the links to Mane: ‚ÄúThe transfer market is not easy and it always depends on the club's financial capabilities. ‚ÄúBasically we are trying to strengthen our team - we are also working on some options on the attack. ‚ÄúOf course you can't reduce yourself to one option, you have to have several options.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-bayern-bundesliga-big-name-liverpool-haaland/blt8f45e4f9a994f9c0,Chris Burton,c114969f-2a32-45de-879c-bf99cc215838

USMNT striker Dike ruled out for eight weeks amid West Brom promotion push,"U.S. men's national team (USMNT) striker Daryl Dike is set to miss up to eight weeks, West Brom boss Valerien Ismael has confirmed.

Ziyech confirms he will not be returning for Morocco as Chelsea star blasts 'misinformation',"Hakim Ziyech has denied claims that he will come out of international retirement to play for Morocco again. The Chelsea star has not featured for the national team since June 2021 and subsequently announced he would not be available for selection. Moroccan football association (FRMF) president Fouzi Lekjaa said this weekend that the 28-year-old would be called up for the upcoming World Cup qualifying matches this month. But Ziyech has taken to Instagram to condemn the president's comments, labelling them ""misinformation"". He posted: ""I love my country and playing for the Moroccan national football team has been the honour of my lifetime, so it is with great sadness that I must announce that although the FRMF President today confirmed that I will be pre-selected for the team, I won‚Äôt be returning to play for Morocco. ""I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint the fans, this was not an easy decision to make, but sadly I feel I have no other choice. ""Despite giving my all to the team over the past 6 years and supporting them my entire life, the leadership continue to release misinformation about me and my commitment to my country. Their actions have made it impossible for me to continue to be part of the team. ""I learned the news about the pre-selection at the same time as everyone else, so I‚Äôm releasing this statement to ensure that you hear the truth directly from me. ""Thank you to everyone who has supported me, I wish the team nothing but the best for the future. ""My focus as a player is at my club Chelsea FC."" Ziyech's retirement came in the wake of a dispute with coach Vahid Halilhodzic. The veteran coach criticised the winger's attitude as he left him out of the squad last September, saying: ‚ÄúHe arrived late and after that, he even refused to work. There was no point in discussing it afterwards, as a coach the answer is right there to see. ""He doesn't want to train, doesn't want to play. He doesn't take it seriously. I'm not going to beg him to come back."" Halilhodzic then criticised Ziyech again in February this year, saying that he would not be recalled ""even if his name is Lionel Messi"". Ziyech announced days later that his national team career was over, saying: ""I understand them, but I will not return to the Moroccan national team and this is my final decision.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ziyech-not-returning-morocco-chelsea-star-misinformation/blt1b732546f35b5499,By Peter McVitie,60ea35bb-ffdc-45a8-bed3-688b71d98d93

"Spain vs Albania: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Spain welcome Albania to the RCDE Stadium on Saturday evening in a friendly match, as Luis Enrique's side continue their preparations for this winter's World Cup. La Roja qualified top of their group after a solid campaign which only saw them lose once in Sweden. Albania, meanwhile, narrowly missed out on a place in the play-offs, finishing third in their group, and are still to qualify for a World Cup. La Roja are overwhelming favourites at 1/7 (1.14) with bet365 to record a win, while Albania are rank outsiders at 16/1 (17.00) to claim a historic victory. Three of Spain's last four friendly matches have ended as draws and another stalemate is priced at 13/2 (7.50). The top scoring Spaniard in La Liga, Espanyol's Raul De Tomas, has had to withdraw from the squad due to injury and has not been replaced. Alvaro Morata has therefore an even better chance of starting the game and is priced at 12/5 (3.40) to break the deadlock ahead of Ferran Torres 15/4 (4.75) and Dani Olmo at 9/2 (5.50). The shortest priced Albanian player to score first is Southampton striker Armando Broja at 25/1 (26.00). Breaking down defensive units has long been a problem for Spain, and the visitors on Saturday night are unlikely to take the game to La Roja. Albania will surely sit deep, inviting Spain to try to find a way through and the onus will very much be on Luis Enrique's side to make the breakthrough. This is where the 2010 world champions often struggle and there could be some temptation to oppose a high-scoring game. In World Cup qualifying, both Spain's games against an ultra-defensive Greece side saw under 2.5 goals, while both of La Roja's opening two group games at last summer's European Championship also saw fewer than three goals scored. Under 2.5 goals is priced at 6/5 (2.20) and could be an attractive and intelligent option for Saturday's clash.

Arsenal vs Spurs: Who will win the crucial top-four battle for Champions League football?,"There are four matches to go in the 2021-22 Premier League season and although the title race clearly takes narrative precedence, one could argue that the battle for the fourth Champions League spot is of greater long-term significance.Arsenal are in their fifth consecutive season without Champions League football and desperately need the extra financial boost ‚Äì and pulling power in the transfer market ‚Äì for Mikel Arteta's project to go to the next level. Although there have been plenty of ups and downs under Arteta, the strong tactical identity he has built, coupled with his apparent command of the dressing room, suggest he could achieve something special at Arsenal with enough time ‚Äì and enough forward momentum. As for Tottenham Hotspur, it is difficult to see how Antonio Conte will be convinced to stay if the club fail to land fourth, while it may also lead to Harry Kane once again angling for a move.  Spurs forever seem to dangle on the precipice of falling out of the elite. Financially speaking, both Arsenal and Spurs are a tier below the other four in the so-called 'Big Six', and the longer they spend outside the Champions League, the harder it will become to compete with the others ‚Äì once Manchester United get their act together, that is. Inevitably, attention turns shortly to the north London derby at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and yet that is not necessarily going to decide who gets fourth.  Their respective fixture lists suggest Conte's side could have an advantage... Arsenal are on a three-match winning run thanks largely to the influence of Mohamed Elneny, who has added a metronomic quality to central midfield alongside Granit Xhaka.  Elneny's battling defensive qualities and his calmness under pressure is more reliable than when Xhaka was playing in front of Albert Lokonga. Elneny and Xhaka side by side lacks the spark with which Arteta wants to play, but it is a good compromise at the moment while the squad is without Thomas Partey.  Coupled with the return of Takehiro Tomiyasu for the win at West Ham, it gives Arsenal the defensive foundation to avoid being overrun in the transition. However, once Arsenal get past Leeds United ‚Äì which they ought to, considering their pace up front makes them favourites in most end-to-end games ‚Äì they may come unstuck in their final two, against Newcastle United and Everton. Arsenal ran out 2-0 winners when they hosted the Magpies in November but a lot has changed since then. Eddie Howe's team have come together thanks to the emergence of Bruno Guimaraes, the repositioning of Joelinton, and the influence of Dan Burn. Newcastle can hold their own in a midfield battle with Elneny and Xhaka, before counterattacking with purpose through a defence that still looks vulnerable with Nuno Tavares at left-back.¬† Howe's well-compressed midblock, hard-pressing in the middle third of the pitch, and focus on using the pace of Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin in the transition is worryingly similar to how Southampton and Brighton recorded wins against Arsenal. On the last day, they face an Everton team fighting for their lives, but enjoying the challenge when it means camping around their own penalty box and pulling off heroics.  Their 1-0 wins against Chelsea and Manchester United were defined by this simple strategy, and it could be enough to win at least a point against the Gunners. On paper, Tottenham have the far greater challenge ahead of them, starting with this weekend's game against Liverpool.  However, Conte's focus on playing a direct game¬† ‚Äì built on drawing the opposition press, then attacking vertically behind them ‚Äì is better suited to games like this one. Jurgen Klopp's high line is very vulnerable to the way Kane drops and Heung-Min Son and Dejan Kulusevski make runs beyond.  Liverpool don't tend to get caught too often this way anymore, and yet the speed and detailed coaching in Spurs' passing out from the back has the potential to suck Liverpool into exposing positions. Rodrigo Bentancur and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg will not be concerned by the pressure they are under, while the aggressive positioning of the Liverpool full-backs hands Son a chance to do what he did to Manchester City in Spurs' 3-2 win at the Etihad. Should Tottenham win this one, they can build enough momentum to cast aside Burnley (who have a very poor 'Big Six' record, particularly away from home) and then get an easy three points against relegated Norwich on the last day. If, as predicted here, Arsenal draw their two tricky games against Newcastle and Everton while Spurs win all of theirs, then a draw in the north London derby would be enough for Tottenham to finish in the top four. It may not prove decisive, then, although of course a win for either club would most likely be a six-point swing from which the loser cannot return.  Yet a draw seems the most likely result, given that neither manager will wish to take many risks should we be level past the hour mark. Conte is particularly good at grinding games down, and he will instruct his players to use any tactics necessary to take the sting out of things.  Meanwhile, Arteta will be wary of Spurs' threat in the attacking transitions and avoid playing daringly out from the back, instead plumping for longer balls out to the flanks. We should expect a fairly cagey game in the end, as two well-drilled sides refuse to be drawn forward by the other.  When matches are so obviously in danger of descending into chaos ‚Äì and Chelsea's 4-2 loss to Arsenal reminded Arteta how easily his direct runners can be drawn in ‚Äì the managers tend to overcompensate. At the final whistle, a nervy draw would look like a good result for the visitors Arsenal. But considering how the other fixtures are shaping up, it might just hand Tottenham the initiative.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-vs-spurs-top-four-battle-champions-league-football/bltc2d7bf3977fbd435,Alex Keble,cc45ae86-d260-4811-ac31-459d33494a52
'Injury stole my dream but I have no regrets' - Iliev opens up on Arsenal exit after contract termination,"For Dejan Iliev, it‚Äôs the end of an era. The Macedonian goalkeeper first arrived at Arsenal in 2012, plucked from near obscurity by Arsene Wenger following a successful trial. But now, a decade on, his time with the Gunners has come to an end following the mutual decision to terminate his contract six months early. Iliev leaves without having made a single senior appearance, with a knee Injury suffered in 2015 sidelining him for 25 months, just as he was on verge of making his first-team breakthrough. But the 26-year-old has no regrets and as he begins his search for a new club, he looks back on his 10-year stay in North London with nothing but affection. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously sad,‚Äù he admits during an exclusive interview with GOAL. ""I‚Äôve been at Arsenal long-term so I‚Äôve got a connection with the club, I love the place. ‚ÄúI went there when I was very young and I met many people. I worked with many different coaches and many big players. ‚ÄúI had the opportunity to work with my idol when I was growing up, Petr Cech. They are all unbelievable memories that will stay with me until I die.‚Äù Iliev added: ‚ÄúThere are definitely no regrets. I made the right choice by joining Arsenal and I was very happy until the very last day. ""It‚Äôs a great club where I didn‚Äôt just improve on the pitch, I improved as a person. I learned a lot of different things and I learned to appreciate different things in life.¬† ‚ÄúTen years have gone very fast and, unfortunately, I had some injuries, but this is part of the business.¬† ‚ÄúEverything has to come to an end some day and that‚Äôs what happened with my time at Arsenal. Now, I have to go elsewhere.‚Äù Iliev spent the first half of this season on loan with SKF Sered in Slovakia. It was a loan spell that started well but an injury then saw him lose his spot in the side and he struggled to regain it after battling back to fitness. So, he returned to Arsenal in January and, after talks with the Gunners hierarchy, his contract ‚Äì which was due to expire in the summer ‚Äì was terminated early. ‚ÄúIt was just mutual consent,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúI asked the club if it was possible and they agreed with it. They listened to what I had to say, I listened to them and, in the end, we thought that it was the best decision."" Having been an Arsenal player for the past decade, Iliev admits the thought that he is now a free agent is taking some getting used to. He is now back in Strumica, in Macedonia, and offers are already starting to arrive from interested clubs. Iliev is in no rush to make a decision, however, with the shot-stopper determined to find a club that can provide him with the stability he has craved for the past few years. ‚ÄúThis is the most important thing for me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a few loans, but a loan is always difficult. You go, you meet people for a short period of time and then you leave. ‚ÄúI would like to put myself in a club where I could stay for the long-term. It‚Äôs very difficult to go to a different country, a different culture, a different coach and adapt in a short period of time.‚Äù Iliev looks back at his time at Arsenal fondly, even though he never got the chance to make his senior debut. His progression after he arrived in 2012 from hometown club Belasica was impressive and it looked like it was only a matter of time before he was given his opportunity by Wenger. But, having twice been named on the bench by Wenger, the knee injury he sustained in 2015 changed everything. By the time he returned to full fitness just over two years later, he was way down the pecking order. ‚ÄúMy dream was to make my debut for Arsenal,‚Äù Iliev said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I signed. It wasn‚Äôt just to train and wait for my salary. ‚ÄúI was training every day to get my first-team debut, but it didn‚Äôt work out. ‚ÄúMy knee injury came at an age when I was developing well and Arsene was giving lots of chances to youngsters. ‚ÄúThere were lots of cup games and everyone at the club was saying I was doing great. So, I was just expecting that moment to come when I would get my chance. ‚ÄúBut then the injury came and it stole my dream.‚Äù Having clocked up 10 years at Arsenal, Iliev played with many great players and regularly came up against top strikers in training. There was Olivier Giroud, Lukas Podolski and, more recently of course, it‚Äôs been Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leading the line for the Gunners. So, who was the best finisher Iliev faced in training during his time at the club? ‚ÄúThere were loads because of the amount of players I‚Äôve trained with, so it‚Äôs difficult to say,‚Äù he answers. ‚ÄúBut if I had to pick one, it would probably be Santi Cazorla. He was amazing. His technique, he could use both feet, he could shoot from anywhere. It was very, very unpredictable. ‚ÄúIt was like he was from another world.‚Äù Iliev leaves with nothing but fond memories of Arsenal. The chance to work alongside Cech will always remain a treasured memory, as will the day he first joined as a teenager. ‚ÄúObviously, signing was a massive thing,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúI was used to watching Arsenal on the TV. Then, all of a sudden, I was training with them and Arsene Wenger was talking to me. This moment I will never forget. ‚ÄúSigning for Arsenal, spending my teenage years there and 10 years of my professional career, it‚Äôs definitely the best thing that has happened to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving as a massive Arsenal fan. I love this club to bits. Everything I have is thanks to them.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/iliev-opens-up-on-arsenal-exit-after-contract-termination/bltd73f0929bfd2efce,Charles Watts,ce68b841-aa5d-48a9-88d9-4b00a4cca90e
World Cup 2022 to start a day early as FIFA confirm Qatar vs Ecuador as tournament opener,"FIFA have confirmed that the 2022 World Cup will start one day earlier than originally planned, with Qatar vs Ecuador set to be the opening game of the tournament. That match will take place on Sunday 20 November, having previously been scheduled for Monday 21 November.  The move has been made following discussions between FIFA and both the Qatar and Ecuador national teams. CONMEBOL are also believed to have requested that the game be moved from its previous slot of 4pm GMT (11am ET) on 21 November.  The alteration has been ratified by the FIFA council, made up of the five confederation presidents and FIFA president Gianni Infantino, continuing with the tradition of the host nation being involved in the opening game of the competition.  England's Group B campaign is set to kick off on the original opening day of the tournament, Monday 21 November, with proceedings against Iran commencing at 1pm GMT (8am ET). The rescheduling of the Qatar vs Ecuador game will not change this. Three matches rather than four will be played on November 21 now that the new plans have been finalised.  The same applies to United States' first game against Wales, which gets going at 7pm GMT (2pm ET).  Moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game is set to have one knock-on effect, however.  Senegal vs Netherlands had been scheduled to be the tournament's opening game on Monday 21 November, kicking off at 10am GMT (5am ET).  With only three games set to take place on that day now, the kick-off time has been changed to 4pm GMT (11am ET).

Muller sends Lewandowski message after Bayern Munich put in Barcelona's Champions League group,"WHAT HAPPENED? Barcelona and Bayern have been drawn in the same Champions League group for the second straight year, with Inter and Viktoria Plzen completing the lineup in pool C.

Salah was 'not talking about Manchester United players' in post-match interview following Liverpool's 4-0 win at Anfield,"Mohamed Salah has insisted that he was ""not talking about the Manchester United players"" in his post-match interview following Liverpool's 4-0 win over their arch-rivals at Anfield. Salah scored twice as Liverpool romped to a comprehensive home win over United on Tuesday night, with Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane also getting in on the act. Jurgen Klopp's men carved the visitors open at will and might have won by an even bigger scoreline, and Salah appeared to criticise his opponents when speaking after the final whistle. ""They make our life easier in the midfield and at the back. They always try to give us the ball in a situation like one against one. So they make our life much easier,"" the Liverpool forward said to Sky Sports. ""We have a clean sheet here, a clean sheet there [at Old Trafford]. We get to the game and want to score one goal. Once we get the first, we want to get the second, once we get the second we‚Äôll go for a third. ‚ÄúBut I think it‚Äôs a top performance from us, here and away.

I meant our midfield, and our defence, make it easy for us.

'I came here to write my name in PSG history' - Nuno Mendes,"Nuno Mendes says he has come to Paris Saint-Germain to write his name in the club's history books after it was confirmed that they had signed the defender on a permanent basis. The 19-year-old is set to remain at Parc des Princes through 2026 after a successful loan spell saw the club trigger their ‚Ç¨40 million (¬£34m/$43m) option to acquire the left-back from Sporting CP. Mendes was an impressive performer as PSG pushed on to reclaim their Ligue 1 crown after losing it the previous season, and speaking after he put pen to paper on a new deal, the teenager stated that his long-term stay would give him a chance to go down as a club great. ""I came here to write my name in Paris Saint-Germain history,"" Mendes told the club's official website. ""It started this year, and I hope to continue the good times for the club, with more league wins, more titles. ""This is what I try to do every time I represent the club. Since I was little, I wanted to play for a big club and Paris Saint-Germain is one."" Reflecting on his own personal campaign at Parc des Princes, the Portugal prospect added: ""From a personal point of view, I think it was a season of learning. I came here to grow and learn. It was a very good season."" Despite his own personal impressions, Mendes was privy to another PSG campaign that saw them fall short of their European dreams in the Champions League despite a host of major arrivals, including Lionel Messi, though Kylian Mbappe's decision to snub Real Madrid at the close of the campaign provided a boost all around. Reflecting on that, the teenager paid tribute to the team ethos on show, stating: ""When we had bad times, the team was able to react in the right manner. We would go to training and do our best, and that's what we did all season. ""Despite the disappointments, the team always responded well. That's also what allowed us to win the league. It was the first time [that negative pressure] happened to me, but I'm sure other players have already been there.

"Messi and Ronaldo 'not intelligent' in making PSG and Man Utd moves, claims Anelka","Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's decisions to move to Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United have not been ""intelligent"", according to Nicolas Anelka, with the former France star stating there would have been no shame in both hanging up their boots. The Argentine and Portuguese superstars sent shockwaves last summer when they moved to new pastures, with the former ending his lifelong Barcelona career to head to Parc des Princes and the latter snubbing Manchester City for an Old Trafford homecoming. But fortunes have been mixed, with both out of the Champions League, and now ex-World Cup winner Anelka has weighed in on their trials, stating that they should have chosen easier destinations, such as China, to wrap up if they insisted on playing on. ""This is what happens to players who want to play longer,"" Anelka told RMC Sport. ‚ÄúTheir careers are over and I think they must both be very happy with what they have achieved in the last 15 years. They were above the others and now it is normal for them to slow down. ""I was more surprised with Messi than with Ronaldo, I thought that Messi would turn around in France and Ronaldo would have more difficulties in England because, for me, the Premier League is the most demanding championship in the world. ""[They] were not intelligent. They should have thought of facing a less complicated challenge because you have to make the right decisions to finish at the top. There are players who don't hesitate to finish at 32, 33, 34 so as not to be criticized. I stopped at 36, but at 32 I went to China."" Both the 34-year-old Messi and 37-year-old Ronaldo have endured seriously mixed fortunes this season, albeit at differing levels. Though both are out of Europe, it is paradoxically the former who has underperformed and will let end the year a league champion in France, while the latter will finish empty-handed despite being one of United's best players. Whether both stick around for the second year of their contracts remains to be seen, though with an eye on the Qatar 2022 World Cup at the end of the year, neither player may wish to uproot themselves at short notice.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-and-ronaldo-not-intelligent-in-making-psg-and-man-utd/bltf3827a075fc10531,Andrew Steel,487ca3dd-0e29-4067-b63c-8052f7b5b13a

Argentina Lionel Messi song: Lyrics & meaning of Albiceleste fans' chant,"Lionel Messi produced his familiar magic for Argentina as they beat Italy 3-0 to win the 2022 Finalissima.

Argentina's darling was once again treated to the 'Messi chant' which has become popular since the 2014 World Cup.

Saul's dismal Chelsea spell ends: Was midfielder the Premier League's worst signing in 2021-22?,"Saul Niguez's dismal loan spell at Chelsea has now come to an end, but was he the worst Premier League signing of the 2021-22 campaign? Much was expected of Saul after Chelsea snapped him up on a season-long loan from Atletico Madrid in September 2021, with the Spaniard having previously established himself among the elite midfielders in Europe during his nine years with Diego Simeone's side. Saul was, however, unable to reach the same level at Stamford Bridge as he appeared in only 23 games in all competitions last term, including just 12 as a starter, and the Blues have decided against taking up their option to buy him outright for ¬£30 million ($41m). The Atletico loanee also only managed to contribute one goal in a Chelsea shirt and, despite picking up a FIFA Club World Cup winners' medal, he admits to having endured a difficult campaign in England. Saul reflected on his short time with the Blues in a farewell post to his followers on Instagram, which reads: ""Hello Blues, I‚Äôm writing to take my leave of you. I would like to tell you how I felt during this adventure. Things didn‚Äôt start well at all. After a long time at home, changing everything wasn‚Äôt easy. Little by little things got better. Saul Niguez finally scores his first Chelsea goal üôå pic.twitter.com/TcGEYsiMDp ""Everything in life serves to improve and learn, and that‚Äôs what I take from this adventure. I‚Äôd like to thank the club for trying to take care of every detail to make me feel at home. ""I‚Äôd also like to give recognition to each worker, thank you. Thank you for making this club much bigger. Thanks to all the fans for supporting me through thick and thin. I will be forever grateful. Thanks to all the staff for making it possible for me to win titles with the blue shirt. ""But above all, I wanted to thank my teammates. They have been fundamental so that I wouldn‚Äôt fall apart. They helped me to continue supporting the team and live a calm and positive day to day. Thank you!"" A case can certainly be made for Saul being the biggest flop of last season, but there were several other contenders for that unwanted title - including his Chelsea team-mate Romelu Lukaku. The Blues forked out a club-record fee of ¬£98m ($123m) to bring Lukaku back to the club from Inter last summer, but he has since struggled to fit into Thomas Tuchel's system and has risked the wrath of supporters with his comments away from the pitch. The Belgian said he regretted leaving Inter in an explosive interview in December and, after finishing the season with just 15 goals to his name across all competitions, he is reportedly now pushing to return to San Siro on loan. Manchester United also invested heavily in new players, bringing in Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho from Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund respectively for a combined ¬£114m ($143m). The former's debut season in England was blighted by injury, while the latter was unable to replicate the electrifying form in the final third that saw him emerge as one of the brightest talents of his generation at BVB. Elsewhere, Manchester City's British record signing Jack Grealish arguably failed to live up to his ¬£100m ($125m) price tag at the Etihad Stadium, albeit while picking up the first league title of his career, and Dele Alli struggled to impress at Everton after Frank Lampard brought him in from Tottenham in January.

‚ÄòYou only run when you see the goal!‚Äô - Salah the subject of cheeky dig from Liverpool team-mate Jones,"Mohamed Salah has found the target on 156 occasions for Liverpool through 254 appearances, with Reds team-mate Curtis Jones cheekily pointing out during pre-season that the Egyptian superstar only runs when he sees the goal. That approach has served a talismanic presence at Anfield well, with three Premier League Golden Boots collected through five campaigns on Merseyside. Records have tumbled around the 30-year-old frontman who, fresh from committing to a new three-year contract, is currently readying himself for the start of competitive action in 2022-23 and bids for more major honours. No questions can be asked of Salah‚Äôs contribution to the Liverpool cause, with his energy during game time saved for when it matters most. He has, however, been showing during pre-season that he is capable of putting in hard yards, with Jones joking during a training camp in Austria that an illustrious colleague is a different player behind the scenes than he is on the pitch.

That‚Äôs how you score goals!‚Äù Jones concedes that Salah is ‚Äúnot wrong‚Äù, but ends the conversation by joking that ‚Äúyou only run when you see the goal!‚Äù Salah has hit two goals through three friendly outings for Liverpool, with one more set to be taken in against Red Bull Salzburg on Wednesday. Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side will then face Premier League champions Manchester City in a traditional Community Shield curtain-raiser at the King Power Stadium in Leicester on Saturday, with a home date against Strasbourg taken in 24 hours later.

Alexander-Arnold fires in incredible long-range goal as Liverpool set their first-half scoring record,"WHAT HAPPENED? Liverpool scored five unanswered first-half goals to set a club record as they blitzed past Bournemouth. The Reds scored two in the first five minutes before Trent Alexander-Arnold smashed in a strike from 25-yards to make it three. Firmino then scored, before van Dijk made it five before the interval.

Man Utd send 'strength and courage' to former manager Van Gaal after he reveals cancer battle,"Manchester United have sent a message offering their ""strength and courage"" to former manager Louis van Gaal following the Dutchman's revelation that he is battling cancer. Van Gaal has enjoyed a hugely successful coaching career spanning over 30 years, two of which were spent in the Old Trafford dugout between 2014 and 2016. The 70-year-old is now in his third spell in charge of the Netherlands and is continuing to work despite being diagnosed with prostate cancer, and the Red Devils have shown their support via social media. Van Gaal announced his condition on Dutch TV show Humberto over the weekend, admitting he had been keeping it a secret from the Netherlands squad. ""I had a pretty aggressive form, got irradiated 25 times,"" he said.¬†""Then you have a lot of management to do in order to go through life."" Van Gaal went on to insist that his form of cancer is not terminal while adding: ""You don't die from prostate cancer, at least not in 90 per cent of the cases."" Van Gaal delivered the FA Cup during his reign at Old Trafford, one of the few trophies the club has won since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013. United have sent their best wishes to the Netherlands boss with a statement on their official Twitter account reading: ""Everybody at Manchester United is fully behind our former manager, Louis van Gaal, in his battle against cancer.

"Man Utd star Rashford not happy with his performances, admits Rangnick","Marcus Rashford is unhappy with his current performances for Manchester United, admits Ralf Rangnick, but the Red Devils boss feels that the England international still can perform to the best of his ability. The forward remains mired in a barren run in front of goal after several lacklustre performances, though he appears to have enjoyed a slight uptick in recent weeks after a dismal start to the new year. Ahead of his side's Premier League clash with Watford this weekend however, Rangnick acknowledged that the performances have been under the player's own standard, while shutting down any suggestions he is still carrying his early-season injury. ""He is definitely not injured,"" the German told his pre-match press conference. ""He definitely has no issues with his shoulder anymore. ""We have spoken a lot about Marcus a lot in the last couple of weeks and I have personally spoken a lot with him. There is nothing else to add on that. It‚Äôs with him like with all the other players, when it counts and they are on the pitch - and he started against Atletico Madrid - they just have to perform. ""I am pretty sure he is not happy with his performance right now but it doesn‚Äôt help if we discuss that every week and talk about our thoughts about what it might be."" Rangnick stressed that he still expects Rashford to bounce back to find a richer vein of form before the end of the campaign, pointing to the experience of England team-mate Jadon Sancho, who has overcome a slow start to life at Old Trafford with a fine run of games. ""We had a very similar situation as I can remember with Jadon six or seven weeks ago,"" he added. ""He is the best example of what can happen. ""Again it‚Äôs the player himself who has to perform and get the best out of his own performance and this is the same with Marcus."" Rashford will look to find the net this weekend if he features against Watford, with United looking to further strengthen their hand in the race for the top four.

Verratti explains why Ligue 1 title-winning PSG feel ‚Äòp*ssed off‚Äô after every game,"Paris Saint-Germain have already wrapped up another domestic title in 2021-22, but Marco Verratti admits the Ligue 1 giants are ending every game ‚Äúfeeling p*ssed off‚Äù as they have nothing left to play for. Champions League glory has proved elusive once again following a dramatic last-16 defeat to Real Madrid, while Nice sent them packing on penalties at the same stage of the Coupe de France. Mauricio Pochettino‚Äôs side are now going through the motions with two matches left this season, and Italy international midfielder Verratti concedes it is difficult to shake a sense of what could have been in the French capital. PSG threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Troyes, with Verratti telling Amazon Prime Video: ‚ÄúThere is a bit of frustration. I think these are matches where you have to have fun, it's about winning and playing well as a team. ‚ÄúWe are in one of the quietest moments of the season because there is no pressure. We just have to have fun. When you are free in your head, you can enjoy it even more. ‚ÄúI'm a little frustrated about that. We're coming to the end of the season and we always come out of games feeling p*ssed off. It's not the thing you dream of at the end of the season, especially when you are already champions.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI honestly think that we could do much better with the team we have. In difficult times, we could be better. When we are good as a team, we manage to take more pleasure from those matches. ‚ÄúIt was a tough season. Even if we are champions, at the start of the season it was tough, we won a lot of matches late on. ‚ÄúThat means we have great character, because we're still there two minutes from the end to score a goal, but I think we could be better as a team. ‚ÄúIt's true that we changed the team a lot with several rookies. It is not an excuse, but it's the truth. It's difficult to create a big group when you change a lot. You have to take the good things of this season and try to build on it for next season.‚Äù Neymar's 100th goal for PSG was ruled out by VAR üò´ pic.twitter.com/bxp18rBvlr While claiming more major silverware, with the Ligue 1 crown wrestled back from Lille, PSG are desperate to savour European glory. Verratti admits the continental defeat to Real Madrid still stings, with Kylian Mbappe having netted home and away in the two-legged tie before the Blancos hit back with a Karim Benzema hat-trick to prevail 3-2 on aggregate. ‚ÄúWe fought hard against Madrid and did 150 minutes very well,‚Äù Verratti said. ‚ÄúWe won the championship, that's good and I think there's not much missing. Everyone has to give more more so at the end we can say: 'OK, we have no regrets, we gave everything, they were stronger'. ‚ÄúWe do have this little regret. We had a dream in the Champions League.

"Chelsea's Lukaku: I wanted to stay at Inter, they have the best fans in the world","Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku has admitted that he wanted to stay at Inter beyond the summer, while describing the Italian club's fans as ""the best in the world"". Lukaku scored 64 goals in 95 games across his two-year spell at Inter and helped the club win their first Serie A title in 11 years. The 28-year-old appeared fully committed to his duties at San Siro until the Nerazzurri were plunged into a financial crisis that led to the departure of head coach Antonio Conte in June, with Chelsea subsequently able to lure him back to the Premier League. Lukaku declared that he was rejoining his ""dream"" club when the Blues snapped him for ¬£98 million ($132m), but has now claimed that he would have preferred to remain in Italy. Inter's inability to hand Lukaku a new contract ultimately made him decide to head back to England, as he told Sky Italia: ""I would have stayed at Inter even without him [Conte], the problem was the new contract I asked for. ""Last summer I went to talk to the Inter board and I asked for a new contract. I said: I'm 28, I want to plan my life in Italy with a new deal... but Inter said no. Maybe there wasn't the economic possibility. For me it was difficult to accept. ""If there had been the offer of a new contract from Inter last summer as I wanted... we would not be doing this interview now here from London, but quietly from Milano!"" Lukaku added on his love for Inter: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always thinking about Milano, Milano, Milano... Inter fans are the best in the world. ""I love the city and the best moment of my career was at Inter. I am in love with Italy - I have Inter in my heart."" Lukaku went on to reveal that he originally planned to stay at Inter until one of Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich came calling for his signature. The experienced frontman says Chelsea were fourth on his list, having previously played for the west London outfit between 2011 and 2014. ‚ÄúThere are 3 teams at the top level: Barcelona, Real, Bayern,"" he said. ""All the players dream of them, that's the truth. I thought I was going to one of those clubs after Inter. ""This didn‚Äôt happen and I said: there is only one club where I can imagine myself, it's Chelsea.‚Äù Lukaku also confirmed that he turned down an approach from Manchester City in 2020 because he felt he owed Inter his loyalty after they gave him the chance to rebuild his reputation following an ill-fated stint at Manchester United. ‚ÄúIn the summer of 2020, I turned down an offer from Manchester City,"" he said. ""It was a higher offer than Chelsea's one. I refused because I couldn't leave Inter after just one year - it's the club that saved my career when I was feeling bad at Manchester United.""

Liverpool to open Klopp contract talks in huge boost for quadruple-chasing Reds,"Liverpool are set to open talks with Jurgen Klopp over a new contract at Anfield, GOAL can confirm. The Reds boss‚Äô current deal is set to expire in 2024, but he has indicated that he would be willing to commit to fresh terms, and discussions are now ongoing over a possible two-year contract extension that will see him remain at Anfield until 2026. Mike Gordon, the president of Fenway Sports Group, was at Anfield for last night‚Äôs Champions League semi-final with Villarreal, together with Marc Kosicke, Klopp‚Äôs agent, and talks are expected to accelerate quickly in the coming days. Klopp has repeatedly said he will leave Liverpool when his contract expires in the summer of 2024. But it is understood that his stance has softened significantly in recent months, and Liverpool now believe they will be able to convince him to extend his seven-year association with the club. Klopp joined the Reds in October 2015 and has since established them as one of the premier teams in world football. He won the Champions League, European Super Cup and Club World Cup in 2019 and followed that up with the Premier League in 2020, Liverpool‚Äôs first league title in 30 years. This season, they are on course for an unprecedented quadruple. They won the Carabao Cup in February and as it stands are still in with a chance of the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup, where they face Chelsea in next month‚Äôs final. Liverpool‚Äôs hierarchy regard him as the perfect manager to lead the club forward, and are ready to move heaven and earth to keep him. Klopp, for his part, is happy and settled on Merseyside. He has a strong relationship with the club‚Äôs owners, Gordon in particular, and is enthused by the direction in which the club is heading, with Julian Ward set to take over from Michael Edwards as sporting director this summer. Keeping Klopp beyond 2024 will be seen as a huge boost to the club, and its supporters.¬† It may also influence and inform decisions from a number of key players over new contracts. Mohamed Salah, for example, is out of contract at the end of next season and is yet to renew. Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain‚Äôs deal will also expire in 2023, while James Milner‚Äôs is up at the end of this campaign. Beyond that, Liverpool will look to continue the smart recruitment which has underpinned their rise under Klopp. Signings such as Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konate, Luis Diaz, Harvey Elliott and Fabio Carvalho, who will arrive from Fulham in the summer, have been made with the long-term in mind, and the Reds are likely to target at least two first-team purchases in the summer window.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-to-open-klopp-contract-talks/blt774a7ab9c8a98caa,Neil Jones,7af8dc1c-5fee-4f8a-b598-d4fa6421dc83
Gassama: Gambia defend referee following criticism from Algeria after Cameroon World Cup qualifier,"The Gambia have come to the defence of Bakary Papa Gassama following what it alleges are constant criticism from Algeria. After losing 2-1 to Cameroon in the return leg in Blida, Algeria requested Fifa that their World Cup qualification playoff against the Indomitable Lions be replayed because of 'scandalous refereeing'. Gassama has since been unnecessarily criticised, according to the Gambian federation, who said it has lodged a complaint over the matter. ""The Gambia Football Federation wishes to inform its stakeholders and the general public that it has been following with grave concern the sustained verbal attacks launched against the person of Fifa Gambian referee, Mr. Bakary Papa Gassama, by Algerian nationals through the various forms of media, ever since he officiated Algeria‚Äôs 2-1 home defeat to Cameroon in the Qatar 2022 Fifa World Cup Qualifiers played on the 29th March, 2022,"" the FA said in a statement. The GFF now wants the concerned authorities to investigate the matter and take action against the people it claims have unduly criticised the official. ""The Federation has lodged a formal complaint to the Algerian Football Federation on the matter, and has formally requested Fifa and Caf to open investigations and disciplinary proceedings against the head coach of the Algeria national football team, Mr. Djamel Belmadi, for his remarks on a video clip and on Algerian television,"" it added. ""Based on the foregoing, we‚Äôve also asked the Algerian federation to make a public statement condemning the actions of Mr. Belmadi and all the verbal attacks against Mr. Gassama by Algerians and take all necessary precautions to restrain their officials and nationals from making any further negative remarks and threats against the person of Mr. Gassama. ""Otherwise, their federation will be held responsible and complicit for any harm that may happen to him. ""In conclusion, the GFF wishes to assure that they are in constant contact with Papa, and that all security precautions are in place to keep him away from harm‚Äôs way when he returns home from an overseas assignment.""

Brazil idol Ronaldo returns to Cruzeiro with mission to save ailing first club,"Stranded in Serie B and watching from afar while their arch-rivals Atletico Mineiro performed a clean sweep of state and domestic honours, it is safe to say that Cruzeiro endured a miserable 2021, casting a long shadow over their centenary celebrations throughout the year. Less than a week before Christmas, however, the Belo Horizonte club received a most welcome gift. The generous giver, moreover, was none other than Brazil legend Ronaldo, one of the greatest players in footballing history, who took the first steps of his scintillating career in Cruzeiro's famous blue shirt before moving on to conquer Europe and the world. On Saturday O Fenomeno announced that he would be purchasing a majority stake in Cruzeiro worth R$400 million (¬£53m/$70m) through Tara Sports, the Spain-based marketing consultancy that is also the owner of Real Valladolid. According to reports in Brazil, Fenway Sports Group, which controls Liverpool, was also interested in purchasing the club, but was beaten out by the two-time World Cup winner, who conducted talks over a takeover over the past three months in remarkable silence given his profile, and is now keen to take on the challenge of resurrecting their fortunes. ‚ÄúI am so happy to have completed this operation. I have so much to give back to Cruzeiro, to take Cruzeiro where they deserve to be,‚Äù Ronaldo beamed in a message recorded on social media on Saturday. ‚ÄúWe have so much work ahead of us. I ask the supporters to connect once more with the club, to go to the stadium, because we need great strength and unity. We have a lot of work and ambitions to remake Cruzeiro. ‚ÄúThere is nothing to celebrate yet, but we have big ambitions.‚Äù Ronaldo is, nevertheless, wary of making big promises. ‚ÄúThe time to come back is here. It's my turn to try and open doors for the team. Not as a hero. Not with superpowers to change reality on my own,‚Äù he warned on Instagram. ‚ÄúRather, with immense responsibility. With intelligent and sustainable administration for medium and long-term. With the loyalty of nine million fans. ‚ÄúWe begin now a new chapter in the club's history. I am back because I believe in Cruzeiro's return, I am back to be part of the transformation of Brazilian football.‚Äù Having received his big break in Belo Horizonte ‚Äì Ronaldo smashed 44 goals in 47 games at Cruzeiro as a 16 and 17-year-old, a record which earned him both a spot in Brazil's triumphant 1994 World Cup squad and subsequent move to PSV ‚Äì it is clear that the former Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter and AC Milan superstar would love to see the club back to their best, although that feels some way off. The Raposa suffered relegation to Serie B for the first time in their history in 2019, and since then have shown little sign of making a speedy return. Indeed, the 2021 season saw them closer to dropping down to the third-tier Serie C, eventually claiming 14th place and finishing just five points clear of safety thanks to an upturn in form under Vanderlei Luxeumburgo ‚Äì coincidentally, an old coach of Ronaldo's at both Madrid and Brazil. To pour further salt in the wound, the past season coincided with a term to remember for their fierce city rivals. Atletico Mineiro took the Mineiro state, Serie A and Copa do Brasil titles, and also recorded a semi-final finish in the Copa Libertadores, starkly exposing the huge gulf in quality between the two Belo Horizonte sides. If the outlook on the pitch is bleak enough, the situation in the boardroom is downright catastrophic. Not only do Cruzeiro, as confirmed by GOAL, hold crippling debt worth more than R$1bn (¬£133m/$176m), they are currently banned from registering any new players by FIFA due to their failure to fulfil transfer payments to two separate clubs. No less than nine footballers are currently affected, having been announced as signings pending the lifting of that sanction. They are fortunate, then, that Ronaldo's public image as a free-wheeling, party-loving playboy ‚Äì he once told Movistar+ that while at Madrid, president Florentino Perez would hire security guards to stop him hitting the nightclubs, but he invariably either escaped their scrutiny or even invited them to join him ‚Äì belies his attributes as a savvy businessman. Valladolid may have suffered relegation from La Liga since his 2018 takeover, but he has taken big steps to improve the economic outlook at the club, who Ronaldo affirmed were ‚Ç¨25m in debt and had just two players on the books when he arrived, the rest being loan transfers. They are also well-placed to fight for promotion back to the top flight this season, sitting fifth in the standings at the halfway stage. As full-back Saidy Janko revealed to Blick, the Brazilian is also extremely close to his players, inviting them home ""to play a bit online against the Juve stars Douglas Costa and Paulo Dybala"". His generosity can also not be faulted, with Janko recalling: ""Once, after a win, he gave us all a Playstation 5!"" Restoring Cruzeiro's battered reputation may prove to be just as daunting a challenge, if not even moreso, than balancing the books at Valladolid. As a player, though, there was little that Ronaldo could not do at his sparkling, mercurial best; and he seems to have carried exactly that same self-belief over to his new guise in the boardroom ‚Äì while, as always, commanding the respect and admiration of fans and players alike.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/brazil-idol-ronaldo-returns-cruzeiro-mission-save-first-club/blt0ee130e5bf8a6dd8,Daniel Edwards,45d16961-ca0a-469c-ac2e-7ef174ade91c
Which football team does Robert Pattinson support?,"Robert Pattinson shot to fame through his roles in the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises, with the success of those films taking him deep into Hollywood.  There, Pattinson has forged a respectable movie career, one which has also seen him portray Batman in the 2022 blockbuster The Batman. He has spoken in the past about how missing football was one of the drawbacks of living in the United States, revealing his interest in the sport. So which football team does he support? GOAL brings you everything you need to know about Pattinson's soccer allegiance. Pattinson is a self-confessed supporter of Premier League team Arsenal. The London native revealed that the Gunners were his favourite team in a 2011 interview with Metro, explaining: ""I miss reading the sport section [of English newspapers]. I miss the football... Arsenal."" In supporting the north London team, Pattinson shares a passion with other actors such as The Wire star Idris Elba and Colin Firth (Love Actually, The King's Speech). Director Spike Lee and rapper Jay-Z are also understood to be Arsenal fans, so they boast an impressive set of followers. Considering that Pattinson hails from England, it is not too much of a stretch to assume that he is also a fan of the Three Lions. Batman, Catwoman and the Joker üÉèüì∏ @neymarjr pic.twitter.com/3skB4UnL3X In February 2022, Pattinson, along with The Batman co-star Zoe Kravitz, met with Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar at the French premiere of the film, but there is no suggestion that he is changing his sporting allegiance to the Ligue 1 giants. Interestingly, despite his love of football, Pattinson has admitted that, growing up, he never wanted to be a footballer, hinting that he did not possess the requisite skills to succeed in the sport. ""The opposite,"" said The Batman actor when asked by GQ if he fancied a career in the beautiful game. ""I still have the same terror when I‚Äôm walking past little kids, and the football rips into the path.  ""I just have this terror of passing it back, and I go straight back to being a 10-year-old, and kicking it in the wrong direction. People being like: 'Wow! What an idiot!'  ""Eventually, I‚Äôm probably gonna have a child. So I‚Äôve started training myself so that I can be somewhat... so that I can play soccer with a three-year-old.""

Can women's football capitalise on Barcelona‚Äôs record-breaking Camp Nou Clasico?,"Talk to any American female footballer who is old enough to remember the 1999 Women‚Äôs World Cup and they will cite the final, played in front of 90,185 fans at the Rose Bowl in California, as an inspirational moment. Of course, that was the official record attendance for a women‚Äôs football match until Barcelona drew a crowd of 91,553 to Camp Nou for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final clash with Real Madrid. It‚Äôs an achievement that cannot be applauded enough. The game, which Barca won 5-2 to progress to the semi-finals 8-3 on aggregate, sold out in three days and, with some of those tickets given away for free or a small fee, the club did an excellent job in ensuring people turned up. As well as hyping the game up massively with constant promotion, tapping into the reach of big personalities on the men‚Äôs side as part of that commercial push, there was a lot of engagement and encouragement to get those attending excited for the big event. Or, at the very least, remind them to pass on their tickets to someone else if they were unable to make it. All of this was built on the club's strong foundation of having already put the women front and centre of its marketing campaigns for a long time, as well as the incredible talent and success the side can boast. Indeed, it's no wonder so many fans wanted to attend, either, given Barca have been bringing its female players onto the Camp Nou pitch during men‚Äôs games for some time now, whenever they have a title or individual accolade to celebrate. Barcelona Femeni show off their league title at Camp Nou ü§© pic.twitter.com/cKd2rGUxrE Wednesday night, then, was proof that the right mixture of marketing, communications, support and platform brings big results. Like the Rose Bowl, this will be a moment that many will talk about for years. Alexia Putellas, the 2021 Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner whose face hangs from the Camp Nou on a banner sporting the words ‚ÄòLa Reina‚Äô ('The Queen'), said it would spark a new era and inspire young girls across the world. The challenge is for the women‚Äôs game to ensure that she is right. Before the outbreak of Covid-19, there was real momentum building in the sport. England welcomed 77,768 fans to Wembley for a friendly against Germany in late 2019, a few months after 60,739 people watched Atletico Madrid lose 2-0 to Barca at the Wanda Metropolitano. With the 2019 Women‚Äôs World Cup final attracting 57,900 fans in between those two games, three of the top five most attended women‚Äôs football matches before Wednesday‚Äôs record-breaker had come in 2019. The pandemic stunted the women's game's growth ‚Äì but, as lockdowns and restrictions have been eased, momentum is building again. As well as Barca‚Äôs success, Paris Saint-Germain welcomed a record number of fans to watch its women‚Äôs team in the Champions League this week, with 27,262 at the Parc des Princes. Lyon also surpassed the 20,000 mark and both Wolfsburg and Bayern hit five figures. üôå‚ù§Ô∏èüíô L'union d'une √©quipe et de ses supporters ! pic.twitter.com/iQtO7pQozD But there are still sobering numbers out there. Arsenal welcomed just 5,018 fans to the Emirates for last week‚Äôs game with Wolfsburg, despite the ground having a capacity of 60,260. The Arnold Clark Cup in England in February also attracted a total attendance of just 1,245 across the three games that the Lionesses weren‚Äôt involved in. Ahead of the Euros this summer, to be hosted by England, it was both concerning and disheartening to see just 249 people turn up to the tournament opener between Germany and Spain, some way away from the record-breaking Clasico crowed many of the latter would play in front of just a few weeks later. Not every game can be built up in the same way as a Barca-Madrid showdown at one of the most iconic stadiums in the world, of course, but there is a responsibility on those in the game now to ensure that Wednesday night does not prove a flash in the pan. Opportunities to play at a large stadium should be exploited to the maximum, while average attendances at the club‚Äôs usual grounds should be a big focus of growth. Building a loyal, regular fanbase is something that doesn‚Äôt make the headlines as much, but is almost even more important. Just @alexiaputellas on the drums after winning El Clasico at Camp Nou ü•Å pic.twitter.com/HKp0lxEAj2 Barca Femeni returned to its permanent home, the Estadi Johan Cruyff, on Saturday for a league game against Villarreal. The team attract between 3,000 and 4,000 fans there each week, a much bigger number than the 500 to 1,000 that watched them in their previous venue ‚Äì the Mini Stadi, which was next to Camp Nou. At the weekend, 3,999 watched on as they won 6-1. Big moments like a Clasico are not just about making history and giving players an experience they absolutely deserve. They‚Äôre also about visibility and attracting more people on a regular basis. All the tools used to pack big stadia can be replicated in similar ways to steadily grow that audience. Barcelona sent a message this week to the whole world: if you create excitement and execute promotion well, you can be successful. They showed everyone that women's football is something that people care about. Now, it‚Äôs about how the rest of the sport responds. With the Euros this summer, then the World Cup next year, this was the perfect moment to have made such a statement. What's essential now, though, is that the women's game in its entirety reacts to the bar Wednesday night set - and that they do so in a way fitting of the show Barca put on.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/women-football-capitalise-barcelona-record-breaking-camp-nou/blt27b3002ba78c11e5,Ame√© Ruszkai,c87baaf0-cf2a-435b-9e16-42fc850eb5d5
'I'm ready if Chelsea need me' - Ex-Blues and Barcelona full-back Belletti targets coaching role in Europe,"Juliano Belletti can boast about scoring a winning goal in a Champions League final, winning a Premier League title at Chelsea and lifting the World Cup with Brazil. It's hardly surprising, then, that a man of such stature has plenty of influential and famous friends at the highest level of the game. Indeed, that was made abundantly clear during a recent whirlwind tour of Europe. It began with a visit to Manchester City to meet with directors Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, whom he got to know at Barcelona. Then, he went to see former Chelsea youth coach Brendan Rodgers, who is now in charge at Leicester City. After that, he took some career advice off his friend and compatriot Edu Gaspar, Arsenal's technical director. He wrapped things up with a trip to Barcelona to rekindle his relationship with the club that turned him into a world-class player. For people in the UK, though, his connection to Chelsea remains the most curious. Indeed, there was some surprise when he was linked with a sporting director vacancy at Stamford Bridge but Belletti is a good friend of Marina Granovskaia and his business skills are respected in west London. Nothing ever came of the rumours, of course, not least because Belletti's objective right now is coaching. But the former Brazil international, who spent three years on the Blues' books between 2007 and 2010, freely admits that he would be open to returning one day. ""My relationship with the club is fantastic,"" Belletti tells GOAL. ""Since I went back to Brazil in 2010, my friendship and respect continued. I used to come back here a lot so a lot of people used to think this (returning as sporting director) could happen. ""They may still think that but it is more about having a good relationship with the club. ""I have a new objective now to be a coach. People keep seeing that I am travelling a lot but it is to maintain the relationships and carry them forward to be even stronger. ""I have Brazilian DNA but I understand the English game after playing it. So, if Chelsea need me, then I am ready. I love the country and city."" However, working as an assistant coach at Cruzeiro has convinced Belletti that his future now lies in management. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't want to do things by halves. Belletti wants to be as good a coach as he was a player. That means learning from his friends and watching matches like Chelsea's recent 2-0 win over Tottenham, which he attended just after sitting down for this very interview to learn from Thomas Tuchel. ""For him to come in and have the audacity to change the whole system and how it works, it is spectacular,"" Belletti enthuses. ""I respect him as a coach. I studied football, so I follow a lot of European teams and how they work. ""One of the teams I like to watch train the most is Chelsea because of the way Tuchel trains."" As he sat in the plush VIP seats at Stamford Bridge, Belletti also saw Thiago Silva dominating a high-level English football match in the twilight of his career. The centre-back's move from Paris Saint-Germain was somewhat similar to Belletti's transfer from Barcelona to Chelsea, in that both arrived at the end of their careers. So, seeing his compatriot defy the ravages of time to turn in such an impressive performance brought back a lot of happy memories for Belletti. ""Anyone unsure about Thiago when he signed didn't know him well enough,"" the former full-back says. ""He was such a high-level player. Of course, when you are old in this sport, then people doubt you. ""But, if you have the right coach, the right tactics for you and the correct people around you as a player, then this helps you to use your experience better. ""Thiago has the right manager, the right tactics, the right team-mates and the right club. At the same time, he gives back by helping through his experience to push the team forward."" Belletti feels he drew on his own Champions League-winning experience to good effect at Chelsea. Of course, the Blues were beaten in the 2008 final by Manchester United, but he thoroughly enjoyed his time at Stamford Bridge from start to finish. ""My three seasons at Chelsea were fantastic as both a player and a person,"" he says. ""It was the last stretch of my career. ""At that age, playing in that team with that group of Chelsea players against Manchester United in a Champions League final was a great achievement for me. ""Of course, I wish I had won it but, luckily, I won it two years earlier."" That victory obviously came with Barcelona, who beat Arsenal in the 2006 final, with Belletti coming off the bench to net an 80th-minute winner in Paris. His time at Camp Nou was obviously the most successful of his career in terms of major titles won, as he also picked up two Liga winners' medals with the Blaugrana. However, he also enjoyed spells at Cruzeiro, Sao Paulo, Atletico Mineiro, Fluminense and Ceara during a peripatetic career that spanned 17 years, so while he made his name in Europe, he knows the Brazilian scene inside out. So, Belletti has some words of warning for Chelsea, who go into the upcoming Club World Cup as clear favourites, but could end up facing Palmeiras in the final. ""Palmeiras won the Copa Libertadores playing good football,"" he points out. ""They are a well-drilled, tactical team with a lot of intensity. ""Chelsea need to be careful because sometimes European teams don't prepare as well as the South Americans and it can give those teams an edge. ""My warning is that Chelsea will find a very difficult opponent."" While he will be an interested observer, for now his focus is on finding a new job, perhaps at one of his former clubs. ""My goal is to come back to Europe and work here,"" he says. ""Edu said something to me that it is very rare to find players who were involved in such a high level who still want to get involved in this way. ""My motivation is to help my players and my team. I played at Villarreal, Barcelona and Chelsea. I have good relationships there. ""I have friends in Manchester City, Brendan Rodgers is my friend, and those teams I played for, or the people I know, could help. I must say that my history with Barcelona, in particular, is special. ""I'm working hard because I want to be an example in my household. I don't want my four sons to see a retired footballer who just sits on the beach.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-barcelona-belletti-targets-coaching-role-in-europe/bltb3e2f2029ab8ddc3,Nizaar Kinsella,bd46cfab-2e9e-48e3-9e67-2cfb60c33be7
Afcon 2021: Milla backs Aboubakar to become one of Africa‚Äôs greatest footballers,"Cameroon captain Vincent Aboubakar could be one of the greatest African footballers, according to the legendary Roger Milla. The 30-year-old is one of the standout performers at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring six goals in five matches played so far. South Africa‚Äôs Benni McCarthy and Egypt‚Äôs Hossam Hassan boast a better tally with seven goals during the 1998 edition hosted by Burkina Faso. Impressed by the Saudi Arabia based striker‚Äôs displays in the 33rd edition of the African football showpiece, the two-time African Player of the Year is not ruling the possibility of Aboubakar being an African football great. ""Aboubakar could be one of the greatest African footballers,"" Milla was quoted by BBC Sport Africa. ""Unfortunately, two years ago he suffered a very serious injury which sidelined him for four months. ""I'm very happy for him because he came into Afcon in good form. When he's playing, it's as if the whole country wants to make up for lost time and they want him to win. ""I hope he gets a goal against Egypt - and why not in the final?"" Cameroon are eyeing a sixth African title on home soil, however, they must negotiate their way past Egypt in Thursday‚Äôs semi-final billed for the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde. According to Milla ‚Äì who lifted the diadem on two occasions during his active days, his country can power on to emerge as champions if they could defeat the North Africans in the last four. ""Egypt is a good footballing nation and they've proved that over the years,"" he continued. ""Cameroon might not have the technique of the Egyptians, but Cameroon have the aggression to win and the power to beat any team. ""I think Cameroon will be motivated, but it's a difficult Afcon and it'll be difficult to get past Egypt. I think that if we can get past Egypt, Cameroon will be favourites. ""I've watched a lot of Afcon, I am a supporter of the Indomitable Lions. ""We are here to support them in the final because we have been waiting for this victory for 50 years in our country.""

Which clubs have provided the most England players?,"Turning out in the colours of your country is the highest honour that any player can achieve, with England fortunate enough to have been in a position to pool talent from some of the finest domestic teams in the business down the years. Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City have all enjoyed periods of dominance in top-flight competition, with home-grown stars often at the heart of their plans. An exciting crop of youngsters have broken through in more recent times, as the countdown continues to another World Cup finals in 2022, but which club sides have produced the most players for England? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Tottenham and Aston Villa have provided the most England players over the years, with the likes of Liverpool, Everton and Manchester United not far behind on the chart. Arsenal and Chelsea are further down the list, but there is still time for them to climb the standings as greater emphasis is placed on nurturing talent through famous academy systems or investing in big-money signings that tick home-grown boxes.

They have also contributed a number of household names to the cause down the years, with the likes of Jimmy Greaves, Glenn Hoddle, Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne all representing their country when on the books at Spurs. Tyrone Mings, Ollie Watkins and Jack Grealish have been the most recent representatives from Aston Villa ‚Äì with the latter now a ¬£100 million ($131m) asset at Manchester City ‚Äì but they were loaded with England stars in the 1800s and early 20th century, while current boss Southgate is also a Villans alumnus.

Nigeria‚Äôs Iwobi: How tests showed Super Eagle is one of Everton's best runners,"Nigeria international Alex Iwobi has revealed how recent tests conducted on Everton players showed he was the best runner in the team. The former Arsenal winger, who celebrated his 26th birthday on Tuesday, has been one of the leading lights for the Toffees under manager Frank Lampard at Goodison Park. He was in great form playing for the entire 90 minutes as Everton defeated Chelsea 1-0 to keep alive their hopes of avoiding relegation from the Premier League. His recent tireless runs have caught the eyes of many and he has explained a set of blood tests conducted by the whole squad at the beginning of the campaign proved he can be one of the best runners in the squad. ""They [tests] showed I can be one of the best runners in the team. I don't know the specifics, I don't understand the science, and it is something to do with lactate. Doucs [Abdoulaye Doucoure], Andros [Townsend], and I were top,‚Äù Iwobi said as quoted by Echo. ""It's weird, it's always been there. I have always been able to run like I am now. There is nothing different about my training. ""I think my teammates knew I had that stamina, especially after the blood tests. Now they are seeing it...'You weren't lying, you can run'. I just say the change of position helped me. ""It is where I grew up playing, I like to get on the half-turn, get the ball forward. I am always trying to play to the attacking players and make something happen. ""When I play infield, I get on the ball more and can take it up the pitch. I told him [Lampard] I'd played there for Arsenal but not had the opportunity at Everton...that it's where I am most comfortable and the position I play for my national team. ""He tried it and it's worked, so far. I felt he was half surprised I could run, he called me a machine.‚Äù Iwobi has further explained how Lampard asked him to have tactical awareness after their top-flight game against Leicester City. ‚ÄúThe manager spoke to me after Leicester about having a bit more tactical awareness,‚Äù he said: ‚ÄúIt is nice to have the energy to run and chase and get back, but maybe sometimes preserve it, chill out so you're not burned out.‚Äô ‚ÄúOther than that he says maintain the work ethic because it really helps the crowd engage with the team. Apart from that opening 10-15 minutes against Leicester, when I was literally chasing everything, I have generally got the press right. ‚ÄúThe manager knows I have the ability to press and quickly get back into shape.‚Äù On managing 90 minutes in recent matches, Iwobi said: ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt help, when I see someone is about to get dragged, thinking, 'Is it going to be number 17?'. In the game, I feel I can run non-stop. ‚ÄúAs soon as the final whistle goes, I am shattered and think, 'How have I done that?'. I have been dropping on the pitch, falling on my knees or to the floor. It comes on instantly, the feeling of, 'I am done'. ‚ÄúI have normally been the first one dragged off. Now, the manager has faith in my ability to run for 90 minutes, to give the same level of effort for the whole game. ‚ÄúIt is nice when I look over and see it's not my number. I think I have another five or ten minutes, at least, to keep battling for the team, to help us win, or come back for a draw, like against Leicester in the last home game.‚Äù Iwobi and Everton will next face Leicester City at King Power Stadium on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nigeria-s-iwobi-how-tests-showed-super-eagle-is-one-of-everton-s-/blt0e8848eb47788bc9,Dennis Mabuka,6981a95f-85a3-4b91-94e8-f7da2d1bc16c
Chelsea Club World Cup final team news: Who will start in goal vs Palmeiras as Mendy competes with Kepa?,"Chelsea will face Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final on Saturday, with the Champions League holders hoping to get one over on the Copa Libertadores kings and secure more major silverware. The Blues edged out Saudi Arabian champions Al Hilal in the semi-finals, courtesy of a solitary effort from Romelu Lukaku, with victory in Abu Dhabi secured without manager Thomas Tuchel in attendance as he had tested positive for coronavirus. Tuchel is still leading as best he can, though, and has more big selection calls to make ahead of another final outing for his side ‚Äì with the toughest of those coming in goal as Africa Cup of Nations winner Edouard Mendy competes with Kepa Arrizabalaga for starting duties. Spain international Kepa got the nod for a semi-final showdown with Al Hilal as Mendy was a late arrival to the camp following his exploits at Afcon. He helped Senegal to continental glory in Cameroon and is now pushing to recapture the number one spot at club level. Stand-in boss Zsolt Low has revealed that Mendy is in contention to start against Palmeiras, telling reporters: ‚ÄúWe're very proud of Edou. The whole squad was happy he won the Africa Cup of Nations. ‚ÄúHe arrives in a very good mood. Always has a big smile on his face. He's very important to the group. He gives a lot of energy. ‚ÄúHe was a little tired the first day, needed recovery and a good sleep, but he is fully involved in training. ‚ÄúWe're very happy that he's healthy and absolutely in good shape with good experience behind him. He's ready to play the game.‚Äù Pressed further on the battle between Mendy and Kepa, Low said: ‚ÄúWe're very happy with both goalkeepers. It's a comfortable situation to have both goalkeepers like this. ‚ÄúNow Edou is back he is fresh, we have to take the decision tonight. We talk to Thomas about it. Final decision will be some hours before the game but if we decide for one or the other the one on the bench has nothing to be worried or sad about. ‚ÄúBoth goalkeepers had a big performance in the last weeks. This is why it's a question just for this game. Tonight or latest tomorrow.‚Äù Tuchel guided his side to European glory in 2021 and would have been desperate to play a leading role from the dugout when chasing down a global prize. He has been prevented from linking up with the rest of the Chelsea squad so far, but Low says there is a chance that he could make the touchline for a meeting with Palmeiras. Asked about the chances of Tuchel making a late dash to Abu Dhabi, Blues assistant Low said: ‚ÄúWe still hope he can come and enjoy the group as soon as possible. ‚ÄúPalmeiras are very emotional.

Ancelotti: Real Madrid could play Bale & Hazard in Champions League final against Liverpool,"Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale could both feature for Real Madrid in the Champions League final against Liverpool, coach Carlo Ancelotti has said. Bale has not featured for the Spanish champions since making a 16-minute appearance against Getafe on April 9, just his seventh match in all competitions this season. Hazard, meanwhile, has played once since mid-February having been given 26 minutes in their penultimate La Liga match of the season. ""Hazard is training well, he can play in the final, Bale can play too,"" Ancelotti told reporters. ""Everyone is motivated. Everyone can participate, whether it's one minute or 10. It's positive that everyone can do it.""  He added: ""The team is fine. We had a little problem with Marcelo, but he will recover well.  ""The team is in good physical condition, we are going to prepare for what we want to do.  ""We're going to give it our all. It's the fifth final in eight years. This team has achieved a lot.  ""The team is happy, calm, with good atmosphere. As we get closer to the game the worry comes, but it's normal."" Ancelotti's son, Davide, who is working as his assistant at the Spanish side, heaped praise on Bale ahead of the final, saying that everyone at the club admires him. ""Gareth is a guy that is loved around the place, from the coaching staff to his team-mates,"" he said.  ""This season he has struggled with injuries but we are happy to have him available for the final.  ""He already gave a lot of trophies to Real Madrid and has a chance to give the club another one.

Emerson targeted in 'horror movie' armed robbery as Spurs star's father claims 'probably 20' gunshots fired,"Emerson Royal was targeted in a ""horror movie"" armed robbery at a party in Brazil earlier this week, with the Tottenham star's father claiming that ""probably 20 shots"" were fired by the assailant. The 23-year-old defender was enjoying a summer break in his homeland following the end of the 2021-22 Premier League season, unwinding in a local nightclub when the incident occurred that left him shaken, but unharmed. The assailant is said to have been struck by a bullet during the altercation and brought to a nearby hospital. The Tottenham full-back was leaving a party with friends and family in the early hours of Friday morning when he stopped to take a photo with and sign an autograph for a police officer. He is then alleged to have been approached by an individual holding a gun, who then demanded that possessions were handed over. The police officer is said to have then drawn his own weapon, with over 20 shots ringing out ‚Äì one of which is reported to have hit the assailant in the back, forcing him to undergo hospital treatment. Globo Esporte report that Emerson attended a police station in the wake of the incident and reported to local authorities that he was fine. Emerson, who took in 41 appearances for Tottenham last season after joining them from Barcelona, has said: ‚ÄúIt was a complicated moment, but for now I'll take a rest and after that I'll speak again.‚Äù His father, Emerson de Souza, told Globo Esporte: ‚ÄúI was celebrating and on the way out, this whole affair happened, which was very bad. A horror scene indeed. I don't wish that on anyone. ""He [the policeman] went, as usual, with Royal to the car and when he realised there was a robbery and the criminal was pointing the gun at Emerson, at the time the criminal got distracted, the policeman started to exchange shots with him. It all happened very fast, there were probably 20 shots. ‚ÄúThere were around five or six people with him. Each one went to a side running, dodging, because they didn't know where the shots were coming from.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/emerson-targeted-terror-movie-armed-robbery-spurs-star-father-20-/blt65a0c5c8c43a4d9f,Chris Burton,885d0b3c-4b2b-4427-9ac0-31d261d16f1d

""Sven Botman has now completed his move Newcastle United from Lille after a deal to bring the highly-rated defender to St. James‚Äô Park was agreed in principle earlier this week,"" the Magpies signalled.

Neymar transfer latest: Brazil star set to stay with PSG next season,"Neymar's recent strife at Paris Saint-Germain will not prompt the Brazil star to seek a new club this summer.  The striker has become the target of fans' frustrations following PSG's exit from the Champions League.  But GOAL understands that he is happy in the French capital and not angling for a move away.  The Brazilian, along with Lionel Messi, was roundly jeered by the Parc des Princes crowd in PSG's first game after crashing out of Europe to Real Madrid.  That episode, added to reports criticising his commitment in training, raised speculation that he could leave the club after five years.  Sources close to Neymar, however, insist that he is settled in Paris and happy with life at PSG.  GOAL understands, moreover, that he remains the side's highest-paid player - with a salary that surpasses even that of Messi or Kylian Mbappe, which poses a further problem with regards to a potential transfer. The Brazilian's representatives believes that he would struggle to match his wages elsewhere, and he is happy to see out his contract at PSG.  Neymar still has three years left to run on his deal, which expires in June 2025.  Injury has caused significant interruption during the current season, restricting the striker to just 21 games.  He has contributed five goals and five assists for his club, while enjoying rather better fortunes in Brazil colours - notching up five goals and four assists in six games this term as the Selecao strolled to World Cup qualification at the top of the CONMEBOL competition.

"Ex-Gor Mahia players Shakava, Musa and Kahata will save Kenya Police from relegation - Omollo","Former Kenya international defender Sammy Omollo has lauded recent Kenya Police FC recruitments from Gor Mahia FC stating they will help the team avoid relegation. The administrative side recently concluded the signing of ex-K'Ogalo defender Haron Shakava on a one-year deal. At Police, the towering defender joined his former partners, Musa Mohammed and Francis Kahata. The renowned tactician has now explained how the trio will impact the league debutants. ""Police have made intelligent and good signings for the short-term in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League,"" Omollo told GOAL on Thursday. ""These are players who have experience and know what to do to get positive results. They have won the league and have even managed to get through the season unbeaten. It is, for this reason, I believe they will be helpful for the Police. ""I am confident they will not get relegated, they will play in the top-tier next season. Ex-Gor Mahia players will save them from returning to the National Super League. ""However, I challenge the team to now integrate experience and youth in that the team will even be better in the long-term. From the signings they are making, it shows they have money which is a good thing. I am happy with what they are doing."" The tactician has further explained how K'Ogalo might be affected after the exit of their former skipper. ""Honestly, Gor Mahia don't have the numbers in defence which is one of the vital departments in a team,"" Omollo continued. ""So the exit of Shakava further weakens them defensively because he is an experienced player who has won the league with them.  ""His exit also means the depth is not good because K'Ogalo right now I think have about 14 players. So they will have to depend on the youth team in terms of providing players. In some departments, they will definitely struggle.""

Chelsea want to complete Kounde transfer from Sevilla as soon as UK government sanctions end,"Chelsea have put in place plans to sign Sevilla's Jules Kounde as soon as Todd Boehly's takeover is complete and sanctions end. With both Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen to depart for Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively, this summer, the Blues are keen to sign a top central defender. Like Chelsea, Sevilla are also keen to do the deal as early as possible in order for Kounde's replacement to be signed and quickly brought up to speed. The 23-year-old has a verbal agreement in place about moving this summer and wants to transfer to Stamford Bridge after talks collapsed last year. The west London club had already agreed on a contract with the player but the move fell apart over both the fee and late timing of the talks. The Liga outfit need to raise around ¬£38m ($47m) to balance the books before June 30. However, they are asking for around ¬£59m ($73m) for the France international defender, who can play at centre-back or right-back. Thomas Tuchel had a meal with prospective new owner Todd Boehly last week, but the pair didn't speak about transfers. Still, there is an understanding around the club that Boehly is ambitious and wants to continue pushing his acquisition towards titles. ‚ÄúHe paid some money for it, so I don‚Äôt think he is keen to drop the ambition,‚Äù Tuchel said after the FA Cup final at the weekend.  ‚ÄúWe will share our opinion in more detail over the next weeks and I am sure he is as ambitious to build a competitive Chelsea for the highest level.‚Äù That has been the basis of scouting and talks with agents behind the scenes, although this has been limited in scope compared to their unsanctioned rivals. Chelsea will likely look to sign multiple players, but it will depend on the takeover, player sales and which loanees return. Conor Gallagher is expected to come back from Crystal Palace and fight for his spot, although his status is yet to be confirmed. The rest of the loanees will fight it out to be in the squad, while there are contract situations needing resolved, including Jorginho, N'Golo Kante, Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta.  Those players with a year left to run on their deal could leave, with others also thought to be attracting offers. In terms of incoming signings, Chelsea have looked at other centre-backs, as at least two are leaving the club. The options include PSG's Presnel Kimpembe, RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol and Atletico Madrid's Jose Gimenez. Beyond that position, Chelsea have looked at West Ham's Declan Rice and Monaco's Aurelien Tchouameni in midfield, with Brighton's Marc Cucurella admired for a wing-back slot. Chelsea could sign attackers, but only depending on player sales, and are aware that Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski could be on the move this summer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-complete-kounde-signing-sevilla-soon-uk-government/blt0a0e69af1f207c7e,Nizaar Kinsella,73572705-36f3-442e-97e4-b8c897370f74
Manchester United make ¬£13m transfer swoop for Malacia after reaching De Jong compromise,"Manchester United are trying to secure a late transfer swoop for Tyrell Malacia after closing in on a compromise fee of ¬£56 million plus add-ons for Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong.  The Feyenoord left-back shares the same agent as De Jong, and Man Utd have made it clear they want both players.  Malacia was close to agreeing a move to Lyon, but Man Utd have agreed a fee of almost ¬£13m plus add-ons and are hopeful of convincing the Dutchman to opt for Old Trafford instead.  United are interested in signing Malacia. He shares the same agent as De Jong - with #mufc making it clear they are interested in both Malacia has spent his entire senior career at Feyenoord ‚Äì making his debut aged 18 in the Champions League against Napoli in 2017. He has gone on to become a Netherlands international and impressed Ten Hag with his performances in the Eredivisie. The decision on his future rests in the hands of the player, who looked set to move to France with Lyon until Man Utd's late intervention.  GOAL can confirm a fee has been agreed with Feyenoord, meaning it is now up Malacia to determine what his next move will be, but Man Utd hope the prospect of joining up with countryman Ten Hag proves decisive. The firming up of their pursuit of the 22-year-old comes as a deal for De Jong edges ever closer, with Barcelona resigning themselves to the fact they will not receive their ¬£86m valuation for the Netherlands international.  Sources close to negotiations insist the transfer of De Jong is not yet complete, with add-ons still to be agreed, as well as the player‚Äôs personal terms.  However a significant hurdle has been passed with the two sides compromising on an initial fee, which is significantly lower than  Barca were originally holding out for.  The Catalan giants‚Äô delicate financial situation weakened their hand in negotiations, with Man Utd football director John Murtough adamant he would not overpay for the 25-year-old.  The player, meanwhile, has repeatedly indicated he wants to stay at Camp Nou ‚Äì but the move is now expected to go through, with De Jong having a strong relationship with his former Ajax manager Ten Hag.  He is seen as pivotal to the system Ten Hag wants to implement at Man Utd as a player who can pick the ball in deep positions and carry it forward.  While Old Trafford sources always insisted they would look at alternative targets, it is clear De Jong is the midfielder their new manager wants above all others, having worked with him at Ajax before his move to Barca in 2019.  The completion of De Jong is expected to pave the way for a raft of business at Old Trafford, with Ten Hag wanting to bring in five new players before the start of the season.  An offer has already been made to out-of-contract Christian Eriksen. Ajax winger Antony is a leading forward target and the Brazilian is determined to move to Man Utd.  Lisandro Martinez, also from Ajax, is among the central defensive options being considered by Ten Hag, while Inter right back Denzel Dumfries is also admired by the Dutchman.

Ligue 1 round-up: Moffi strike not enough as Lorient suffer defeat against Reims,"Nigeria international Terem Moffi was on target but his goal could not help Lorient as they suffered a 2-1 Ligue 1 defeat against Reims at Stade du Moustoir on Sunday. It was the away team who took a deserved lead in the 17th minute through Arber Zeneli before the 22-year-old Super Eagle levelled matters for Lorient in the 32nd minute. However, Mali international El Bilal Toure drilled home what turned out to be the winner in the 59th minute. After a host of missed chances, Lorient were made to pay when Reims took the lead, Toure setting up Zeneli, who scored with a simple finish from close range past goalkeeper Matthieu Dreyer. Moffi then put his side level, beating the offside trap before running down on goal and sneaking the ball with a simple finish past goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic. Reims regained their lead when Toure received a cross from another Mali international Kamory Doumbia before sliding his effort past the advancing Dreyer. Moffi has now scored eight Ligue 1 goals this season and has been shown one yellow card. He opened his account for the top-flight against Monaco on August 13, scoring during a 1-0 victory. Up next up for Lorient - who are in 16th position on 34 points - is Ligue 1 action is a home match against Olympique Marseille on May 8. Meanwhile, Mali left-back Youssouf Kone and Issa Kabore of Burkina Faso featured for Troyes as they registered a 3-0 victory against LOSC Lille at Stade de l‚ÄôAube. Ironically, all the Troyes goals came from the penalty spot, Florian Tardieu converting in the 43rd and 86th minutes while Iko Ugbo scored in the 55th minute. Lille‚Äôs defeat was compounded further as two of their players - Renato Sanches and Burak Yƒ±lmaz ‚Äì were sent off in the 50th and 68th minutes, respectively. Elsewhere, Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Bamba scored into his own net as Monaco cruised to a 2-0 victory against Angers at Stade Louis II. Bamba‚Äôs own goal came in the 42nd minute before Wissam Ben Yedder sealed the game in the 61st minute. The Angers line-up also featured Souleyman Doumbia from Ivory Coast, who was yellow-carded alongside his compatriot Ismael Traore. In another fixture, the Democratic Republic of Congo defender Vital N‚ÄôSimba was yellow carded as Clermont Foot suffered a 2-0 defeat against Brest at Stade Francis-Le Ble.

Bayern Munich make third transfer approach for wonderkid Tel as Rennes pressured to cash in on youngster,"Bayern Munich are in France on Tuesday to hold talks with Rennes over a possible deal for striker Mathys Tel, GOAL can confirm. The German team are eager to sign the 17-year-old and have already had two offers turned down by the Brittany club. A third offer has been made by Bayern as they look to enhance their attack even further following Serge Gnabry's contract extension and the signing of Sadio Mane as well as defender Matthis De Ligt. The German champions made an initial offer of ‚Ç¨7 million plus (¬£6m/$7m) ‚Ç¨10m (¬£9m/$10m) in bonuses. They then followed that up with a second offer of ‚Ç¨22.5m (¬£19m/$23m), which was also turned down by Rennes. They are still determined to lure the young Breton striker to Bavaria, however, and have fielded another bid. Rennes will respond quickly to the offer. GOAL understands that Bayern sports director Hasan Salihamidzic arrived in Brittany on Tuesday morning to meet with Rennes' leaders and find out their expectations.  Rennes will reflect on the offer for a few hours and should give a quick answer by the end of the day. Tel made his first senior appearance for Rennes in the 2021-22 season when he came off the bench to play five minutes against Stade Brest in their second Ligue 1 match of the campaign. He went on to play six more times in the French top-flight, plus two more in the Europa Conference League and one in the Coupe de France. Overall, he has featured 10 times for the club. NXGN correspondent Asad Raza adds: What‚Äôs this, we hear you say? There‚Äôs another French wonderkid coming out of Rennes? Yes there is, and we‚Äôre glad you asked. NXGN luminaries such as Eduardo Camavinga, Ousmane Dembele and Jeremy Doku have all come of age at Roazhon park. Some of the finest talent to emerge from anywhere, but trust us when we tell you that Tel may be the best of the lot. It all began last August when, aged 16 years and 110 days, he became the youngest player in Rennes history, breaking Camavinga‚Äôs record.  From then on, Tel hasn‚Äôt looked back. A striker who combines elastic dribbling with great acceleration, Tel began the season by scoring six goals in six games for Stade Rennais B. That kind of form doesn't go unnoticed. Ten senior appearances followed, but it was for France where Tel really made his mark. Three goals en route to captaining France to glory at the Under-17 Euros was the exclamation mark affixed to a breakout season. Bayern Munich have made an offer this summer, and promised Tel first-team action. From Bretagne to the Bundesliga, you can be sure he‚Äôll take it in his stride. In the meantime, you‚Äôll find us wandering around Brittany, trying to bottle whatever they‚Äôve got in the water over there.

Kane would score 'a lot of goals' at Bayern as Nagelsmann drops transfer hint after Lewandowski exit,"Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann has labelled Tottenham star Harry Kane as being a ""very expensive"" player, but suggested that the England skipper would thrive in Germany were he signed to replace Robert Lewandowski. With Lewandowski having joined Barcelona, Bayern are potentially on the lookout for a replacement striker, with Sadio Mane likely to be tasked with filling in should a natural No.9 not be found. In a press conference, when asked if Bayern Munich would be interested in signing Kane, Nagelsmann said: ‚ÄúVery expensive, that‚Äôs the problem. But a brilliant player, one of the best forwards, and perhaps one of two or three centre forwards who really can play as a centre forward. ‚ÄúThe last couple of years he did not play centre forward. Most of the time, he dropped a little bit at No.10. He is good as a No.10 as well. ""He is very strong, has a strong body and it‚Äôs possible that he would score a lot of goals in the Bundesliga, but it will be tough, I think, for Bayern Munich. We will see what will happen in the future.‚Äù Earlier, Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn had clarified that the club are not interested in signing Kane in the current transfer window, but did not rule out a ""dream"" move for the striker in the future. ‚ÄúHe's under contract with Tottenham. Sure, an absolute top striker, but that's all a dream of the future. ‚ÄúNow we have to look at getting the squad together for the current season. Let's see what else happens."" Bayern have been one of the busiest teams in this summer's transfer window, with Lewandowski's sale just one aspect of the business they have done. They have made two marquee signings in the shapes of Sadio Mane and Matthijs de Ligt, who they could end up spending in excess of ‚Ç¨120 million (¬£102m/$122m) on if all add-ons are paid. They have also brought in Ryan Gravenberch and Noussair Mazraoui from Ajax, while talks are ongoing over moves for RB Leipzig midfielder Konrad Laimer and Rennes' teenage striker Mathys Tel. They have been just as busy in allowing players to leave, too, with the likes of Marc Roca, Corentin Tolisso and Niklas Sule having already departed, while United States international Chris Richards is close to agreeing a move to Crystal Palace. One player who will not be leaving, though, is Serge Gnabry, who has signed a new contract at the Allianz Arena having previously been linked with the likes of Real Madrid, Liverpool and Chelsea.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kane-score-goals-bayern-munich-nagelsmann-transfer-hint/bltb051aa1922d31a9c,Ritabrata Banerjee,2b55d025-8427-4666-9329-3523d0c76d20
Lukaku back in Chelsea squad but must clear up ‚Äòmess‚Äô caused by controversial interview,"Thomas Tuchel has confirmed that Romelu Lukaku is back in the Chelsea squad after being dropped from the Blues‚Äô plans following a controversial interview with Italian media. The Belgian striker was left out of a thrilling 2-2 draw with Liverpool after suggesting in comments to Sky Sport Italia that he had not wanted to leave Serie A champions Inter in the summer of 2021 and was frustrated with the role he is being asked to fill in a different tactical system at Stamford Bridge. Tuchel opted to take Lukaku out of the firing line for a high profile Premier League fixture, but is happy to have cleared the air with his ¬£98 million ($132m) frontman and will consider the 28-year-old for the first leg of a Carabao Cup semi-final clash with London rivals Tottenham on Wednesday. Tuchel has told reporters when asked about the Lukaku saga: ‚ÄúFirst of all, we are happy that we took the time to look calmly on it, this is what we did. He apologised and is back in the squad for training today. The most important thing was to understand and believe it was not intentional. ‚ÄúThere was never the slightest behaviour against the team. These are very important points to understand that it is not that big as people or you want it to be. It is also not small but small enough to stay calm, to accept an apology and to move on. ‚ÄúHe is aware of what happened and he created and feels the responsibility to clean the mess up but there may still be a smell of course. We are happy that he is our player and we will protect him. If someone strongly disagrees, this is about the team with everything we do. ‚ÄúHe is very committed. That is why it was so surprising to me. He scored against Villa and then the next game but he was there and decisive. I never, before the interview, had the slightest doubt that he was not committed. He is an emotional guy, he does not hold back with his opinion. We should not just blame him and point on the negative side of it, we have to adapt. It created some noise that you don't want but there are zero doubts in his commitment to the team.‚Äù While there are still questions hanging over Lukaku and his long-term future in west London, Tuchel is confident that a proven performer was not looking to cause trouble in the Chelsea camp or push for another move during the January window. The German tactician added: ‚ÄúI have read more difficult quotes to cope with in previous years as a coach. He was not happy beachside he was injured and had Covid but he wants to score for us, make us successful and that is pretty much it. I don't see any misunderstanding in communication. That is why I was surprised, and still am. He's our number nine and I cannot say any more. ‚ÄúWas the intention to create trouble? To leave the club? I don't know, put pressure on the coach? No. Of course he should have known better but that is why we have cleared the air together.‚Äù Lukaku had netted twice in as many games for Chelsea prior to taking in another enforced absence, with his goal tally for the season taken to seven in all competitions. He will be hoping that there are many more to come, with Tuchel looking for one of the most fearsome forwards in world football to find a way of producing his destructive best regardless of the role he is asked to play. On talk of Chelsea not getting the best out of their No.9, Tuchel said: ‚ÄúI think the players get the best out of themselves. With Romelu it is not about finding positions, he is a striker, a number nine and that is it. It is about adaption to a different team, team-mates, then comes Covid. We are in a totally normal place with him.‚Äù Why not pick your team for this matchday and play with SPITCH - a live fantasy football manager platform where users can enter fantasy football contests and win real money.

"Where did it all go wrong for Bielsa at Leeds, and how can Marsch secure Premier League survival?","The sacking of Marcelo Bielsa has proven, once again, that the great wealth divide between the Premier League and Championship leaves no room for sentimentality. Leeds United will stand to lose at least ¬£50 million if they are relegated this season, and no matter what anybody says about the team‚Äôs recent performances, that is the sole reason chairman Andrea Radrizzani made ‚Äúthe toughest decision I have had to make‚Äù in sacking Bielsa. Bielsa is rightly a Leeds legend. He is not the first to have revived a sleeping giant or taken a Championship club into Premier League mid-table, but few have made such powerful emotional ties in the process.¬† In the end, fear of relegation has taken precedence over emotion; over the bond that had made this such a special project. It is a damning indictment of the modern game that relationships like this are no longer considered the most important part of football. It has been suggested that Bielsa was likely to leave at the end of the season anyway, and therefore to bring his departure forward by a few months is pragmatic rather than callous. But even if that was true, Bielsa deserved a chance to fight against the drop and leave, on his own terms, to a standing ovation at Elland Road. There is reason to believe that fight could have been successful, despite the bottom having completely fallen out of Leeds over the last few weeks.¬† Yes, this has all the hallmarks of a typical Bielsa collapse, but it should be noted that prior to this six-game winless run ‚Äì which included games against three of the ‚ÄòBig Six‚Äô, by the way ‚Äì they had won back to back Premier League games. Leeds are still not in the bottom three and, with Kalvin Phillips and Liam Cooper returning in a fortnight, a revival was possible. Bielsa deserved that chance, not least because he should not be a victim of his own success. Most of the Leeds squad is still Championship standard. He ought not to be punished for failing to repeat a miracle. Radrizzani will feel justified, however, given the noteworthy decline, although the underlying numbers point to a simple story of injuries disrupting Bielsa‚Äôs season. Their expected goals (xG) and expected goals against (xGA) are significantly worse than last year. At the current rate, by the end of the campaign their xG will be down by 12 and their xGA up by 13, a 25-goal swing that neatly captures how Leeds‚Äô problems have come in the two penalty boxes. If that sounds obvious, the point here is that Leeds continued to play with the same tactical dexterity, desire, and skill in the overall construction of their attacks and defensive organisation. What was missing was those final actions ‚Äì the actions that would have been made by Patrick Bamford in attack or Cooper in defence. Compared to last season Leeds are hitting the same numbers of shots (13.7 per game) and creating a similar number of chances (9.88 per game, down from 10.4), but their conversion rate has dropped from 11.9 per cent to 8.2%. Bielsa really needed Bamford. Defensively, Leeds‚Äô passes per defensive action (PPDA, a metric used to measure a team‚Äôs pressing ability) is actually improved this season, down from 10.3 to 9.7, while their interceptions have gone up slightly, 10.8 per game compared to 10.4 in 2020-21. But Leeds are leaking goals because they miss Cooper, who last season topped Leeds charts for interceptions (2.4 per game), tackles (2.7 per game), blocks (1.3 per game), and aerials won (3.8 per game). Clearly something did shift, mind, over the last six games, when exhaustion and low confidence saw the high-risk tactical strategy fall like a house of cards. That is always the way with something so fine-tuned and so attack-minded, but with Cooper and Phillips returning, a sense of control and order may well have re-emerged in time for a relatively kind run-in. That optimistic state of affairs now awaits Jesse Marsch, the former New York Red Bulls and Red Bull Salzburg head coach who is set to be named as Bielsa‚Äôs successor. Marsch‚Äôs six-month tenure with RB Leipzig earlier this season went very badly, a mutual termination coming with the Champions League club sat 11th in the Bundesliga, but Leeds fans should not be put off by this hiccup. Until then Marsch‚Äôs career had been on a sharp upward trajectory, and even the ending at Leipzig can be read positively. Marsch was a bad fit because Julien Nagelsmann had altered the tactical identity of the club, turning Leipzig into a more patient and possession-based side with less of an interest in high-intensity pressing. It was too difficult for Marsch, from the German school, to swing things back the other way. That is by no means his mission at Leeds ‚Äì they are a club with a tactical vision that is largely shared by the incoming head coach. The underlying principles that led him to consecutive (and record-breaking) doubles at Salzburg are similar to those of Ralf Rangnick, who first appointed Marsch as his assistant manager at Leipzig. As Rangnick‚Äôs protege, it will be no surprise to learn Marsch believes in hard pressing and exploiting the attacking transitions with sharp vertical football. He expects his teams to tackle high up the pitch and use the ensuing disorganisation to break the defensive lines, getting quickly in behind in typical Germanic style. This makes for a seamless transition from Bielsa, albeit with some of the murder-ball reined in. Marsch is not as dogmatic - who is? ‚Äì and will take a calmer and more pragmatic approach to the task. Crucially, he does not believe in the man-to-man pressing system used by Bielsa, which means an end to those wild battles and the emptying of central midfield. Instead, Leeds will be organised in a system that works hard to remain compact, keeping small distances between players and pressing in a way that maintains shape - and closes down spaces, not men. Leeds will be more like Ralph Hasenhuttl‚Äôs Southampton; defined by pressing and attacking transitions, but understanding the necessity of dropping into a safer midblock for long periods when facing stronger opposition. That easing off of the most demanding and exposing aspects of the Bielsa regime, coupled with the return of Cooper,¬† Phillips and potentially Bamford from injury, could be enough to restore some balance at Elland Road.¬† It will not be as exciting, or as emotional, but as the next step on Leeds‚Äô mission to become an established Premier League outfit it is a sensible appointment.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wherewrong-bielsa-leeds-marsch-premier-league-safety/blt9a3de96a7398a639,Alex Keble,bd651e9e-c141-4c1e-9f3c-475722a707a5
‚ÄòI had a Sadio shirt as a kid‚Äô ‚Äì Elliott explains decision to take Mane‚Äôs old No.19 at Liverpool,"Harvey Elliott has been explaining his decision to inherit Sadio Mane‚Äôs old No.19 shirt at Liverpool, with the 19-year-old seemingly destined to tread that path after first donning said jersey as a child. A Senegalese superstar has bid farewell to Anfield during the summer of 2022, with a Champions League and Premier League title winner with 120 goals to his name opting to take on a new challenge at Bayern Munich. Jurgen Klopp and Co are looking for somebody to step up and fill that void, with teenage playmaker Elliott eager to follow in the illustrious footsteps of a boyhood idol by filling a role that a Reds icon occupied between 2016 and 2018. The England U21 international was handed the No.67 jersey after being added to the senior squad at Liverpool, on the back of a switch from Fulham, and has taken in 20 competitive appearances to date. He believes the time is right to step up the pecking order on Merseyside and feels no added pressure from inheriting Mane‚Äôs old shirt, telling the Reds‚Äô official website: ‚ÄúObviously the number became available, some great players have worn it in the past ‚Äì the likes of Sadio and the list goes on. ‚ÄúI think it was an opportunity to get down the ranks in terms of the numbers, and for me personally it's a wonderful number. ‚ÄúI remember having a Sadio shirt with the number 19 on it as a kid. So to be able to wear it after him, it's a great pleasure. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, a number is just a number, but it's just nice to have a lower number. I think it's a great opportunity going into another season. ‚ÄúSo, hopefully I can prove to myself and prove to everyone that I'm able to have these kind of numbers and able to perform under this kind of pressure, because it comes with it. ‚ÄúI'm just so excited to put this shirt on and get playing again.‚Äù Elliott, who battled his way back from a badly dislocated ankle last season to see more minutes under Klopp, is filling a jersey that nobody has occupied since Ozan Kabak‚Äôs loan spell at Liverpool came to a close in the summer of 2021. Mane, who moved to No.10 in 2018, was No.19 immediately prior to that and remains the standout performer to have donned that jersey for the Reds in the Premier League. Among the others to have filled that role in the Reds‚Äô squad are former England international midfielder Stewart Downing, Dutch forward Ryan Babel and ex-Spain international striker Fernando Morientes.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sadio-shirt-kid-elliott-explains-decision-mane-no-19/bltb44a8df200fccd8f,Chris Burton,a33b23a4-2209-4cd0-84c5-5de0bef6a274
Haaland set to decide future in next month with Real Madrid and Man City both close to transfer,"Erling Haaland is set to decide his future in the next month, with both Real Madrid and Manchester City vying to capture the Borussia Dortmund man as their new star signing. The Norway international is likely to depart the Bundesliga outfit for one of Europe's biggest heavyweights at the close of the 2021-22 campaign, and GOAL understands the forward will make a call in March. Both Madrid and City have pushed hard to capture the 21-year-old and it has been previously suggested that Haaland favours Los Blancos over all other suitors. Both Real Madrid and Manchester City have long been linked with a move for the attacker, and over the past few months, both have emerged as clear-cut frontrunners for his signature. They do not however remain the only clubs in contention, with other European heavyweights such as Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund's main Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich all linked with a move for his services. In addition, the Black and Yellow remain hopeful that they can convince Haaland to remain, given that his current deal does not actually expire until 2024. As both the respective leaders of La Liga and the Premier League, both Madrid and City not only have the financial clout to secure a release for Haaland from Dortmund, but also offer the prime incentive of silverware that he craves. Since arriving at Dortmund in 2019, Haaland has won just one trophy - the 2020-21 DFB-Pokal - leaving him with a mostly empty cabinet to date. A move to either Madrid or Manchester would likely see him perform as the spearhead of a title-contending side, helping both him and his new club on to greater riches. Given that Haaland is only one man, both Madrid and City are thought to have contingency operations in the pipeline should their overtures be unsuccessful. Los Blancos have long courted PSG forward Kylian Mbappe, with the France superstar's deal at Parc des Princes up this year, while City boss Pep Guardiola has made no secret of his love for Tottenham and England lynchpin Harry Kane, whom he tried to sign four times last term. But City could well have the edge given reports that Madrid want Haaland to wait for a move until 2023, potentially to help cement Mbappe's arrival as a financial balancing act - and the forward is unlikely to want to bide his time for another year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-set-to-decide-future-in-next-month-with-real-madrid/bltba39d3938cc18662,GOAL,0ccd7247-2faa-4311-b3ab-f2b02a94d58a
NFTs & football: What are they & which players are involved?,"NFTs seem to be the only thing anyone is talking about, in the football world and beyond ‚Äì so what exactly are they? Chances are you've seen the likes of John Terry and other footballers change their social media icons to one of a cartoon ape, or seen these types of digital art being traded. Certain NFTs have been bought for massive amounts of money. So what are NFTs, why are footballers trading them, and what is the deal with the cartoon apes? GOAL takes a look. NFT stands for ""non-fungible token"", which means a unique digital collectible that is tracked on a blockchain to prove its one-of-a-kind authenticity. The data underlying NFTs are bought and sold for very high prices, and can represent anything found online ‚Äì including art, photos, match highlights, 3-D renderings of trophies and music files. One can think of NFTs as similar to real-life collectibles like trading cards or vinyl records in that they each have their own qualities. They cannot be replaced by the exact same specimen - or in the case of NFTs, the exact same underlying data - thus making them ""non-fungible"". Only one person can own something that's been digitally authenticated on a blockchain, despite others being able to save other, non-official versions themselves. Often, football NFTs are given added legitimacy because they are produced directly by players, clubs or leagues. ‚ÄúAs a mechanism, NFTs make it possible to assign value to digital art, which opens the door to a sea of possibility for a medium that is unbridled by physical limitations,‚Äù Noah Davis, a specialist in postwar and contemporary art at Christie‚Äôs, told Wired. Kind of - but not really.  Sure, if someone on Twitter, for example, changes their icon to an NFT that they purchased for millions of pounds, any other user can simply right-click and save that image and use it as their own icon ‚Äì something a lot of Twitter users have poked fun of. The point of an NFT, though, is that an item has underlying code attached to it with the proof of the buyer's record, meaning that only they own the official version. In other words, a right-clicked image would not be considered ""real"" because it's not backed by data on the blockchain. Nonetheless, social media platforms like Twitter are starting to introduce incentives to prevent an NFT being ""copied"" by others. Users who pay for Twitter Blue can have their NFTs properly authenticated as their icon, with the paid-for service allowing NFT users to have their icons displayed as a hexagon. For the already wealthy, buying NFTs seems to be a straightforward and successful investment, especially if they are also exceedingly popular. Footballers can use their status and wealth to buy up NFTs ‚Äì which are pricey and can cost up to hundreds of thousands of pounds ‚Äì and sell them at a higher place at a later date, a process known as ""changing hands"". ‚ÄúIn the old days, retired players used to open a pub or do after-dinner speaking. Now we see people like John Terry using his millionaire lifestyle to attract supporters into buying into NFTs with the unspoken promise that it will allow them to access the kind of lifestyle he has,"" says Martin Calladine, co-author of Fit and Proper People, a new book about how football clubs are owned. Essentially, footballers are using their influence to get ahead in the NFT market, which is seen by many experts as an investment vehicle akin to other types of speculative trading such as the stock market. The NFT market is already a lucrative one for those actively trading. A Kylian Mbappe card for example,¬†changed hands in December 2020¬†for about ¬£47,000 (¬£65,000) on the platform Sorare, and this weekend, that number could be shattered by a one-of-its-kind Erling Haaland card. Former Chelsea and England defender John Terry has been active in the NFT market, having sold a ‚ÄúJohn Terry Ape‚Äù for an auction that eventually attracted bids over ¬£5,200 ($7,000). These cartoon ape NFTs ‚Äì an NFT project titled Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) ‚Äì¬†are particularly popular amongst celebrities and high-profile figures. They are available for purchase on OpenSea, an NFT marketplace. Reece James also seems to be involved in the NFT market, though it looks like he was given his Bored Ape NFT instead of purchasing it. Terry has successfully invited several current stars and former team-mates to trade Bored Ape NFTs, such as Ashley Cole, Tammy Abraham and Bobby Zamora. Paul Pogba has recently endorsed NFT project CryptoDragons, announcing his plans to purchase NFT Eggs. ‚ÄúI am happy to announce to you I‚Äôm partnering with a phenomenal project called CryptoDragons,"" Pogba said on his Instagram. ""This is my first time getting NFTs, so this is huge. You see I‚Äôm going to get some dragon Eggs so as you know what‚Äôs gonna happen - I‚Äôm gonna be the ‚ÄúFather of Dragons."" Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold was also briefly involved in NFT trade after he changed his profile picture to an NFT of Muhammad Ali, though he quietly took it down after some negative backlash from fans. Others, such as Antoine Griezmann, Gerard Pique and Rio Ferdinand, have invested in entire platforms such as Sorare that market many NFTs to users. Bored Ape Yacht Club is a popular NFT project that creates designs with apes. The cartoon ape features myriad designs, and each one is unique; customisation includes the changing of accessories, background and clothes. The cheapest ‚Äúfloor price‚Äù for BAYC NFTs ‚Äì the lowest price at which NFTs can be bought ‚Äì is 66ETH (¬£163,000/$220,000). A statement on their official website reads: ""BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs‚Äîunique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation. ""When you buy a Bored Ape, you‚Äôre not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art.

Eighteen months in the making: How Chelsea tried and failed to convince Real Madrid-bound Rudiger to stay,"Antonio Rudiger has been clear, without ever being totally clear. ""I don‚Äôt want to go too deep into things,"" he told reporters when asked about his decision to leave Chelsea in the aftermath of their FA Cup final loss. ""There was a chance, but sanctions were not the problem."" The belief, then, that the Blues could have secured a new contract for their star centre-back were it not for their ownership issues had been blown out of the water. The real reasoning for Rudiger's departure have not been disclosed by the player himself, but GOAL has learned that it has been a long time coming, with the defender's exit set to be confirmed in the coming days when Real Madrid officially announce his arrival at Santiago Bernabeu on a free transfer. Problems first began to arise in the early weeks of the 2020-21 campaign, when Frank Lampard told the Germany international that he would be Chelsea's fifth-choice centre back following the arrival of Thiago Silva. Though naturally disappointed, Rudiger was, however, able to force his way up the pecking order, rising to third in Lampard's defensive hierarchy, with his improvements triggering Chelsea to open contract talks with a player who was approaching the final 18 months of his deal. The offer that was forthcoming, however, singled the beginning of the end of his time in west London. Chelsea were only willing to offer Rudiger a one-year extension to his contract, rather than fresh terms, meaning his salary would remain at ¬£100,000-a-week until the summer of 2023. The Blues would also have been willing to let him leave on loan in the January 2021 transfer window, with AC Milan showing a keen interest before they switched their attentions to Rudiger's Chelsea team-mate, Fikayo Tomori. Regardless, Rudiger was open to signing the contract, and even agreed to the terms verbally. The issue was a demand for a small signing-on bonus was dismissed out of hand, despite it helping Chelsea retain the value of the player, by director Marina Granovskaia. From that moment on, Rudiger's time as a Chelsea player has been on the clock. Not that you would have known it from his form on the pitch, though, with the 29-year-old having played a key role in the club's Champions League triumph after Thomas Tuchel replaced Lampard in the dugout. Rudiger's form under Tuchel led to Chelsea re-opening contract negotiations in August 2021, with the Blues now willing to offer him a ¬£140,000-a-week salary. Both the player and his representatives felt that undervalued Rudiger, and talks again stalled, with no further contact made between the two parties until January, when other clubs were also free to talk to the ex-Stuttgart star. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, my contract negotiations had already started to get difficult last fall,""Rudiger said in a considered interview with Players' Tribune. ‚ÄúBusiness is business, but when you don‚Äôt hear any news from the club from August to January, the situation becomes complicated. ‚ÄúAfter the first offer, there was a long gap of just nothing. We‚Äôre not robots, you know? You cannot wait for months with so much uncertainty about your future. ‚ÄúNo one saw the sanctions coming, but in the end, other big clubs were showing interest, and I had to make a decision. I will leave it at that, because business aside, I have nothing bad to say about this club. ‚ÄúChelsea will always be in my heart. London will always be my home."" Rudiger's last stand with Chelsea.... fittingly, he comes off with a clean sheet in tact. #cfc pic.twitter.com/NNmlnrBnO4 Chelsea did eventually make Rudiger the kind of offer that he had hoped for, but they were too late, with the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich a smokescreen for a battle they had already lost. Instead, Madrid won a race that also involved Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, as well as Manchester United, with Rudiger telling Ralf Rangnick that he did not want to join another Premier League club. Regardless of whether he chose Chelsea or another team, Rudiger would have been set for a huge pay rise this summer, with the way contract talks were handled at Stamford Bridge proving the final sticking point. Only the fact that he has strong relationships with a host of players, as well as Tuchel, has stopped him going on the record about his feelings, and is in turn why he remained part of the Chelsea team until the very end of the season, unlike Barcelona-bound Andreas Christensen. There are now concerns that Chelsea could have face similar situations with the likes of N'Golo Kante, Jorginho and Marcos Alonso, who are all out of contract at the end of next season, while Mason Mount and Reece James need to be given huge new deals if they are to stay given the academy graduates are among the lowest-paid players in the first-team squad. For now, though, Chelsea fans can bemoan the loss of perhaps their most consistent performer of the past 18 months. Antonio Rudiger might never reveal his true reasons for leaving, but read between the lines, and the messaging is clear.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/eighteen-months-chelsea-failed-convince-real-madrid-rudiger/bltb43ea6b01bd9a13c,Nizaar Kinsella,55bf7c63-f556-485d-b690-5a8d4fac0d4b
'We both won so let's go!' - Arteta ready to face Tottenham challenge as Arsenal look ahead to vital north London derby,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has backed his side to pip north London rivals Tottenham to fourth place as the battle to qualify for the Champions League looks to go all the way. The Gunners were briefly leapfrogged by Spurs after Antonio Conte‚Äôs side beat Leicester earlier on Sunday, but Arteta‚Äôs team responded with a 2-1 win at West Ham to end the weekend back in fourth. Arsenal are two points clear of Tottenham with four games remaining, with one of those fixtures a pivotal north London derby at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on May 12. Arsenal were far from their fluid best at London Stadium, but goals in each half from centre-backs Rob Holding and Gabriel were enough to secure all three points. It was also enough to guarantee a return to continental competition of some description next season, though Arteta is aiming for a spot in the Champions League. ‚ÄúYou have to find a way to win and today we won ugly,‚Äù Arteta told BBC Sport. ‚ÄúWe have to recognise that is the way we had done it. ‚ÄúWe showed incredible spirit because when we could play the way we wanted to play we had to find a way to play the way they prefer. We adapted. You have to find a way to win all the time - forcing mistakes, being brilliant, digging in, clean sheets. ‚ÄúI am really happy, especially for Rob Holding as he hasn‚Äôt played the amount of minutes he deserves. He was man of the match today. He is always there when we need him."""" Asked whether the race for the top four could go all the way, the Spaniard added: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see.

"Pozuelo to Miami, Bernardeschi to Toronto: Breaking down MLS' latest blockbuster trade","One of MLS' top playmakers is on the move, opening the door for one of the league's most ambitious clubs to pull off yet another game-changing signing. Toronto FC have traded former MLS MVP Alejandro Pozuelo to Inter Miami for $150,000 (¬£125,000), giving the Floridian club the superstar No.10 they've been needing for some time. And, while that fee may be cheap, it does get Pozuelo off TFC's books as they now reportedly look to bring in yet another Italy international to add to their attack. It's not often you can get a former MLS MVP for pennies on the dollar, and that's what makes the acquisition of Pozeulo absolutely massive for a team like Miami. At a cost of just $150,000 GAM, the decision was a no-brainer for David Beckham's club, who have been lacking a true, veteran No.10 and now have one of the best MLS has to offer. A two-time MLS All-Star and the 2020 MLS MVP, Pozuelo has been one of the league's best playmakers since joining Toronto FC from Genk in 2019. Official üá™üá∏‚úçüèΩWelcome, Alejandro Pozuelo#InterMiamiCF welcomes Spanish attacking midfielder and 2020 MLS MVP @Pozuelo_10 from Toronto FC, in return for General Allocation Money. https://t.co/PiXc0CyVJh There are some caveats, though. The Spaniard struggled with injuries in 2021 and hasn't played up to his own lofty standards over the last 18 months or so. Much of that can be attributed to TFC's setup in general, as the club has been, at best, treading water in a system that didn't fit Pozuelo's strengths. So, with that in mind, there's plenty of reason to believe Pozuelo could be a key player for years to come at just 30 years old. Miami now have a No.10 to slot behind Leonardo Campana, a player that has been a revelation since joining on loan from Wolves. Making things all the better is Pozeulo's familiarity with the league, meaning he'll need little time to adjust to all of the nonsense MLS has to offer. With the club still very much in the playoff chase, it could be the acquisition of Pozuelo that pushes Miami over the hump and moves them a little bit closer to where they want to be. As we determined earlier, it's not often an MLS MVP is moved for pennies on the dollar. And it certainly isn't often you can look at a move like that and go 'Okay, I see what you're doing there.' But that's exactly what this move is for Toronto, who are losing one key player to bring in one that could be even better. The loss of Pozuelo is an unfortunate one, but one they can stomach. The Spaniard was nearing the end of his contract and didn't look to be a natural fit for the club's tactical plans going forward. We already know Lorenzo Insigne is on his way and will likely occupy a spot on the left wing. It has also been heavily reported that the DP spot freed up by trading Pozuelo will be used to try to lure Juventus winger Federico Bernardeschi to take up a spot on the right. Bernardeschi hasn't quite become a star at Juventus, but he should be one hell of an attacking piece in MLS, especially with Insigne on the other side. With Insigne and Bernardeschi, TFC have two forwards that should create plenty of goals, making Pozuelo expendable. Losing Pozuelo creates an easy switch to a 4-3-3, offering TFC a bit more midfield balance behind their attacking stars. And they may not be done, either, as it appears DP Carlos Salcedo may be shipped out soon as well, freeing up even more space to be creative. By trading Pozuelo, Toronto FC have accelerated their rebuild by paving the way to sign a Euro 2020 winner to go with the one they already have, giving the club a chance to be one of the most exciting attacking teams in MLS. They'll need that to happen quickly, though, as TFC sit well outside the playoff race as we enter the dog days of summer. Right now, hard to say. We know Miami will be a winner here, even if Pozuelo does turn out to be a short-term rental.

Newcastle United release 2022-23 home kit inspired by the past,"Amidst the speculation of a Saudi-themed away kit, Newcastle have officially unveiled their 2022/23 home kit.

Klopp warns Carvalho 'will need patience' from Liverpool fans despite ¬£8m star's ability to 'bring a stadium to its feet',"Jurgen Klopp is urging patience with Liverpool new boy Fabio Carvalho despite admitting that the talented teenager, who has cost the Reds ¬£8 million ($10m), boasts the ability to ‚Äúbring a stadium to its feet‚Äù. A 19-year-old Portuguese winger has officially completed a move to Anfield from Fulham that was put in place back in May, with GOAL confirming a month prior to that announcement that a deal had been agreed. Big things are expected from Carvalho‚Äôs future, with the present all about learning from the ‚Äúbest teachers‚Äù on Merseyside, and Klopp hopes a hot prospect will be given time in which to unlock his full potential. Klopp has told Liverpool‚Äôs official website of why the Reds moved to snap the youngster up and why he is a signing that should excite a loyal fan base: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to finally be able to welcome Fabio and to introduce him properly to our supporters. ‚ÄúWhat a talent he is, hey? A player who can bring a stadium to its feet. He puts his personality into his performances, he is confident and adventurous with the ball, and he wants to make things happen. ‚ÄúHe is a versatile player for sure and is very much an attacking threat with his creativity and dynamism. ‚ÄúIt was a wonderful season for Fulham last year and Fabio was a worthy winner of the individual recognition he got as a result of that.

He has a dressing room full of the best teachers in football who will help him settle and adapt. ‚ÄúWith us, a player of Fabio‚Äôs profile will get opportunity along with space to improve, learn and develop further.

Eight assists were recorded alongside 10 goals in the second tier last season as the Cottagers swept to title glory and promotion back into the Premier League.

'Great chance' - De Bruyne reacts to Mahrez miss as Man City squander late opportunity to sink Liverpool,"Kevin De Bruyne admitted that Riyad Mahrez's late chance to earn an injury-time victory for Manchester City against Liverpool was a ""great chance"" blown in the Premier League, but added that the Algerian would be hailed if his gambit had paid off. Mahrez attempted to chip Reds keeper Alisson with effectively the final attack of the game from the hosts at the Etihad Stadium, only to miscue his shot and put it well over the target, ensuring that the spoils were shared in a 2-2 draw. The opportunity to win and put four points between City and their title rivals was not lost on De Bruyne, but the Belgium international was quick to praise his side's combined effort in taking another step towards a potential title defence. De Bruyne, who earlier scored his side's opener, was the one who provided the through ball to Mahrez in the late stages of the game. It was a difficult opportunity to be sure, but one Mahrez has converted in the past. ""It's a great chance,"" De Bruyne told Sky Sports in his post-match comments. ""Riyad chose to chip and if it goes in, it's a wonder goal. ""[But] today we played very well, I think we had the upper hand. This is the way we need to play the rest of the season.

Liverpool defender Gomez suffers leg injury against Southampton with England international limping off,"Joe Gomez suffered what looked like a nasty leg injury on Tuesday against Southampton. The defender, starting because of squad rotation by manager Jurgen Klopp, went down after an attempted challenge late in the first half. Gomez remained in the match until half-time before making way at the break for Jordan Henderson, with James Milner shifting to right-back. ""I hope we were lucky,"" Klopp told reporters after Liverpool's 2-1 win. ""He has pain but not too much. He got a real shock to the system. But he's sitting in the dressing room and was in a good mood when I spoke to him."" The defender has been unlucky with his health over the course of Klopp's tenure, with this being just the latest in a long line of injuries. He has previously dealt with achilles, ankle and various knee problems. Gomez has been rarely used this campaign as other defenders have been prioritised. The lack of playing time has led to speculation he could depart Anfield this summer, with Aston Villa one of the teams most regularly linked, but nothing has been determined yet regarding his future.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-defender-gomez-suffers-apparent-leg-injury-against/bltd7cc8be1c843bd73,Dan Bernstein,460baa99-421c-47f6-9f06-0b6b3fb8a03e
'Man Utd could write a book on how not to do transfers' ‚Äì Fowler rips into Red Devils as Liverpool close on Nunez,"Liverpool appear set to win the race for Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, with GOAL confirming the Reds are confident of beating arch-rivals Manchester United to a ¬£75 million ($94m) deal. Robbie Fowler has taken great delight in pointing out that the Red Devils ‚Äúcould write a book on how not to do transfers‚Äù. Those at Old Trafford appear set to be left empty-handed in the pursuit of the highly-rated Uruguay international who scored 34 goals for Portuguese heavyweights last season. Man Utd missed out on a top-four finish again during the 2021-22 campaign, and former Reds striker Fowler believes lessons from Merseyside need to be heeded by those in Manchester. Fowler told The Mirror: ‚ÄúWith the record signing of Darwin Nunez looking all but done for Liverpool, what fascinates me is the presence of Manchester United amid the negotiations. ‚ÄúI can guarantee the Anfield people would have been uneasy with that, as it has the potential to push up not only the price, but the wages too. No agent worth his salt wouldn‚Äôt use it to get a bigger contract, let‚Äôs be clear. ‚ÄúMan Utd being there in the background - for me - highlights just why this could so easily be another masterstroke for Liverpool in the transfer market, and it‚Äôs a point that is so often overlooked in the desperation to see new faces, new signings, new excitement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be cruel, but Man Utd could have written a book on how not to do transfers in recent seasons. Signing players just because you don‚Äôt want them to go to a rival? Check and double check. ‚ÄúCristiano [Ronaldo] has done his job well enough, but signing him because he could have gone to Man City? That just had disaster written all over it. The same with Alexis Sanchez. No, not the same, 10 times worse. ‚ÄúThat deal highlights everything that has been wrong at Old Trafford. How much did it cost? About 500 grand a week in wages, which I saw somewhere cost them about 20 million quid a goal! ‚ÄúMuch, much worse though, was that it didn‚Äôt just break Man Utd's pay structure, it shattered it. That‚Äôs how a goalkeeper [David de Gea] can end up on ¬£400,000 a week, and a midfielder like [Paul] Pogba who couldn‚Äôt even get in the team half the time on even more.‚Äù Manchester United don't wish to enter a bidding war with Liverpool for Darwin Nunez, they are ready to move on to other targets üóû pic.twitter.com/1bp55UXrU8 The Reds are moving for Nunez, having already snapped up Colombian winger Luis Diaz in January, as questions continue to be asked of how long Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah will be at Anfield. The Senegalese star continues to see a summer move to Bayern Munich speculated, while the Egyptian talisman is yet to extend a contract that is due to expire in 2023. Fowler added on Liverpool moving to bring in reinforcements: ‚ÄúYou can see the thinking with Darwin Nunez. Mane is 30, he‚Äôs 22. Selling Mane could raise around ¬£40m, and Nunez cost ¬£80m. But. And this is a significant but... ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll most likely be on less than half the wages Mane was asking for. Which over the course of a five year contract could save them all of that extra ¬£40m. On top of that, it doesn‚Äôt break the wage structure. ‚ÄúLooking at it that way, replacing a 30 year old with a 22 year old whilst keeping your financial house in order is a bloody good win for Liverpool, and it‚Äôs something Man Utd must follow.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-transfers-liverpool-nunez-fowler/bltfcebcc43ec2367e5,Chris Burton,113f3df2-a86d-45d9-a32d-61a3da22d4c3
'USMNT is scared of Canada!' - Larin doubles down on teammate's bold claim after World Cup qualifying win,"Canada national team forward Cyle Larin has doubled down on comments calling the United States ""scared"" to face his side after a 2-0 win in World Cup qualifying on Sunday. Larin said Canada is the best team in CONCACAF at the moment despite the USMNT often receiving more hype. Indeed, Canada is on top of the region's qualifying table in qualifiers and remains unbeaten through 10 games. Over the weekend Canada goalkeeper Milan Borjan first stated that the USMNT was scared of its northern neighbors - a claim Larin went on to agree with. ""When they come to us, or we go there, they're scared,"" Borjan said. ""They're scared. Last four or five matches, they've been scared against us. Because we have an amazing team."" Larin then said to Futbol Americas: ""I agree. We have that belief in us, and you can see it when we're playing out there. ""We're Canadian guys, they're Americans, so it will always be a fight. You see each game, we're battling, we're arguing, we get in scuffles.

Chelsea sale on hold as potential buyers wait for clarity amid Abramovich sanctions,"The sale of Chelsea football club has been put on hold as potential buyers wait for clarity amid the sanctions imposed upon Roman Abramovich by the UK government, GOAL can confirm. Abramovich initially announced that he was passing on the stewardship of Chelsea to trustees after Russia began their invasion of Ukraine on February 24. The 55-year-old then went a step further and put the club up for sale, inviting bids in excess of ¬£3 billion, but his assets have now been frozen as the UK continues to try and help destabilise Russia's economy. GOAL has learned that the sale of Chelsea is now officially on standby in light of Thursday's announcement. Swiss-American duo of Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly, Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak and American duo Jamie Reuben and Nick Candy have been among those to express interest in buying the club over the past fortnight. After seeing Abramovich sanctioned, however, investors and those involved in negotiations are now taking stock as they await clarity on the road ahead. Abramovich is unable to make any money from Chelsea while his assets remain frozen, but the club can still be legally sold as long as the UK government is involved in the process. The Blues would need a special license from the government to complete a sale and they would then determine the destination of the funds raised. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said of the situation: ""It‚Äôs fair to say the Government is open to a sale of the club, but it would require another licence. ‚ÄúWe are now talking to Chelsea Football Club. Those conversations will continue. The important thing is under no circumstances of any sale would allow Roman Abramovich to profit from that or take any money from that sale. ‚ÄúThe principle has been to try to mitigate the impact on fans ‚Ä¶ these measures are designed to punish those close to Putin and make sure any money generated can‚Äôt make its way through to the Russian war machine.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-sale-on-hold-as-potential-buyers-wait-for-clarity/blt84e3d027583774f0,Nizaar Kinsella,cbb182ff-64a7-4766-b6f2-0bad8eaba511
John Obi Mikel at Manchester United: What might have been?,"It is the mark of great dramas that they bear scrutiny years after their finales air. They are rested, but they never rest; constantly exhumed and pored over for some fresh insight or plain old nostalgia. Mikel John Obi‚Äôs eventual move to Chelsea in 2006 was precisely that ‚Äì a suspenseful soap with twists and turns aplenty, and more than a dollop of suspense, and even now that the man himself has clarified the events that led to his decision to renege on a contract with Manchester United, there remains still a tantalizing question to ponder over. How might things have turned out if he had stayed the course, and turned out for the Red Devils instead? In order to begin to ponder this, one must first see exactly how it did turn out for the parties involved. Mikel's time in London was one littered with successes: a Champions League success from two final appearances, one Europa League winners‚Äô medal, two Premier League titles, two League Cups and four FA Cups. His influence at Stamford Bridge also rose steadily, and whereas he fulfilled a more sparing role in the early years, come the improbable run to glory in Europe in 2012 he had become firmly established as a first-teamer. For¬†their part, Manchester United went on to play in three Champions League finals, winning one (incidentally, against Chelsea); they also amassed five league titles, one FA Cup and two League Cup triumphs. While Chelsea marginally shaded the trophy haul in terms of pure numbers then, it is clear that neither party came off significantly worse on that front from the messy break-up. As such, it is not so much a case of if things might have been better, as what might have changed as a result. Perhaps the biggest potential change surrounds former England international Owen Hargreaves. Amid a strong league 2006/07 season that saw them claim a first title in four years, Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äôs side were in with a chance at a famous treble until the start of May. Those hopes were, however, extinguished ruthlessly by AC Milan in the Champions League semi-final second leg. Despite arriving San Siro with a slender advantage and on the back of a rousing comeback in the first leg, the Red Devils were swatted aside 3-0 in the rain. Time and again, the hosts exploited the space between the lines of United‚Äôs defence and midfield, and Michael Carrick in particular endured a difficult evening. Midfield partner Darren Fletcher fared no better. It was for this reason that Ferguson pulled out all the stops to sign midfielder Hargreaves from Bayern Munich in the summer of 2007. That transfer made a ‚Ç¨25m dent in the transfer kitty, but it was clear to the Scot that was an area in desperate need of reinforcement. ‚ÄúI was only ever leaving Bayern Munich for Man United and I remember Sir Alex said to me 'one of the reasons I signed you is to help us win the Champions League, I think you can help us do that',‚Äù Hargreaves told BT Sport in 2019. Hargreaves would star as United went all the way that season, overcoming early injury constraints to play decisive roles against Barcelona in the semi-final (out of position at right-back in both legs) and Chelsea in the final. In all, he spent four years at Old Trafford, but only made five more appearances after that first season. He would later suggest the quality of healthcare he received while at the club may have been to blame. His relationship with Ferguson would also deteriorate over time ‚Äì the Scottish manager labelled the midfielder his worst-ever signing, and described the transfer as a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù in his autobiography. Had Mikel been on Manchester United‚Äôs books already, it is unlikely they would have felt the need to shell out for a frequently-hobbled Hargreaves. Instead, the former Nigeria captain, having spent 18 months getting acclimated at Old Trafford, would have been well-placed to immediately step into that breach. In addition, not only was Mikel younger, but he enjoyed a comparatively sterling injury record, and also demonstrated his versatility by playing a few games out of position at centre-back for Chelsea. For the player‚Äôs part, he might have benefitted from a less restrictive tactical brief had he joined Manchester United instead. Much has been made of Jose Mourinho‚Äôs decision to deploy him as a holding midfielder, but in truth, his skill set and physical attributes always lent themselves to the role. That said, while the idea of Ferguson‚Äôs United as a relentlessly attacking side is overplayed, he certainly would have been granted greater license to display the full range of his abilities in a less regimented system. In over 200 Premier League appearances, Mikel managed a single goal and 11 assists in his time at Chelsea. For contrast, Michael Carrick, who similarly played at the base of the midfield for United, scored 23 and assisted 36 in just under 500 appearances. It did not always manifest in his time in England, but Mikel always had a flair for goalscoring, as is clear whenever he was pressed into a more attacking role for Nigeria. It does paint a picture, and perhaps playing a freer game would have afforded the 34-year-old the degree of esteem his talent deserved. As already established, there was enough success on both sides of the aisle that there can be little regret on their parts, but it is easy to see how the question of how things might have panned out remains an intriguing one.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/john-obi-mikel-at-manchester-united-what-might-have-been/blta0aeb44dc872f907,Solace Chukwu,b3da9b57-737d-464f-bb0b-63bae6ce6f13

Asano had initially appeared on the fast track to success when he joined J-League champions Sanfrecce Hiroshima in 2013 aged 18, playing one senior game as they retained their crown, before going on to establish himself in the first team. By 2015, as Hiroshima sealed their third title in four seasons, he was their lead striker, with nine goals in 34 matches, having picked up a rookie of the year award along the way. Asano was also making a name for himself at international level, too. In 2016, earned Japan their maiden Asian Under-23 Championship title with two goals in a 3-2 final win over South Korea before being selected for the Rio Olympics later that year, scoring twice even though his country was eliminated at the group stage. His performances caught the eye of Wenger, who had coached Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan before joining Arsenal, and Asano moved to London in July 2016, aged 21, with his new manager convinced he could be a star of tomorrow. However, Asano immediately encountered problems as he was denied a work permit. At the time, players coming from outside the European Union (EU) either had to have a certain number of international caps or cost more than a particular fee ‚Äì Asano evidently did neither and was, thus, prevented from playing in the Premier League. However, the potential that Wenger had hoped to tap into was obvious. A quick and skilful dribbler, his direct style may have appealed to Arsenal as he joined the same summer they were rejected by Jamie Vardy. Certainly, his compatriots were in no doubt that Asano was capable of great things. ""He is a player between Eden Hazard and Theo Walcott,"" Japanese journalist Koki Harada is quoted as saying by Bleacher Report in 2016. ""Very fast and capable of finding the space behind the defender, he is not only a goalscorer but also a chance-maker. ""His nickname is 'Jaguar' because he runs quickly and hunts the ball. He is now doing an imitation of a jaguar as his goal celebration."" For the following three seasons, Asano went on loan to Germany as Arsenal attempted to sort his paperwork. He enjoyed some success on the continent, helping Stuttgart win 2.Bundesliga in 2016-17, but two subsequent top-flight campaigns, with Stuttgart and then Hannover 96, proved less successful, yielding just one goal in 28 games combined. ‚öΩ 6Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ ‚öΩ 8Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ How many of you remember üáØüáµ Takuma Asano's brace at the 2016 #AFCU23 Final ü§î #WaybackWednesday pic.twitter.com/yqh3U1Carq All the while, he continued to struggle to secure a work permit, and his issues at club level perhaps unsurprisingly affected his international standing. In 2018, he was named in Japan's preliminary squad for the World Cup, but manager Vahid Halilhodzic directly cited Asano's issues at Arsenal as a reason for him not being picked for warm-up friendlies before cutting the player from his final 23 for Russia. By 2019, Asano was at a crossroads. Hannover general manager Horst Heldt, unconvinced by his loan spell, deliberately left the forward out of his team for the final two months to avoid activating a compulsory purchase clause, even as they suffered Bundesliga relegation. Asano himself was losing confidence. ‚ÄúThis season I had repeated injuries and was unable to continue playing in the game and was unable to leave any results,"" he wrote on a personal blog. ""I think it was a difficult, tough, frustrating season looking back now. The only thing I can have confidence with is to feel that 'growth' is possible every day. ""I would like to do my best again from here to connect the growth to the results!"" With one year left on his Gunners contract and now aged 24, he needed a fresh start and was allowed to leave permanently. He spent two seasons with Partizan Belgrade, where, playing regular football for his parent club for the first time in Europe, he finally found form. In 2020-21, he scored 18 goals in 33 Serbian SuperLiga matches, thus earning himself a return to German football with Bochum at the end of that season. While he is still far from a Bundesliga goal machine ‚Äì scoring once since re-arriving in Germany ‚Äì he is still an important, hard-working cog for his club. He was also welcomed back into the Japan squad after two years in the international wilderness, becoming a virtual ever-present throughout his nation's successful qualification for Qatar. And his World Cup campaign could not have got off to a better start against Germany, as Asano netted an 83rd-minute winner to secure the greatest result in his country's history. The strike was nothing short of world class, with Asano taking down a high ball expertly, racing past Nico Schlotterbeck and smashing home at the near post.  Wenger always said Asano was one for the future. He has been proven right. It's just taken a little longer than expected.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/takuma-asano-arsenal-wonderkid-hazard-qatar-japan/bltc2d6832a8149ed9c,Emma Smith,227a9a2f-8404-4307-a217-25d4cb6b87b0
"Queen's Platinum Jubilee: Bale, Milner & the footballers who have been included on 2022 Birthday Honours List","Gareth Bale, James Milner and Rio Ferdinand are among the football stars of past and present to have been recognised in the 2022 Birthday Honours List as Queen Elizabeth II celebrates her Platinum Jubilee. Wales international Bale, who is leaving Real Madrid as a free agent this summer after winning five Champions League crowns while with the Blancos, has been awarded an MBE alongside veteran Liverpool midfielder Milner. Former Manchester United defender Ferdinand has collected an OBE, as have ex-Manchester City winger Mike Summerbee and Watford legend Luther Blissett. Bale, who is expected to prolong his distinguished playing career into 2022-23 while also taking aim at a potential outing for his country at the World Cup finals in Qatar, has been recognised for his services to football and charity. The 32-year-old has said: ‚ÄúReceiving an MBE in the Queen‚Äôs Birthday honours list is a very proud moment for my family and I. ‚ÄúTo be given this news as we prepare to celebrate the Queen‚Äôs Platinum Jubilee makes it feel even more special. ‚ÄúI joined a football academy at the age of nine, so the sport is a defining part of my identity.

"Tuchel: Chelsea are protected football-wise, but things can change tomorrow","Thomas Tuchel has expressed his belief that Chelsea appear to be ""protected football-wise"" despite the sanctions that have been imposed on Roman Abramovich, but he also admits that ""things can change tomorrow"". Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale after 19 years at the helm earlier this month, explaining that the move was in the club's ""best interest"" amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The Russian billionaire was unable to close a sale before being sanctioned by the UK government, though, and the Blues are now dealing with the repercussions of his assets being frozen. Chelsea are still able to continue playing games under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home fixtures from now on, and the club will be unable to make any transfers.¬† Tuchel was asked if he is concerned about the situation before his side's latest Premier League fixture away at Norwich, to which he replied: ""I don‚Äôt know if I am concerned, but we are aware of it. It changes almost every day, so we cannot do much about it. I am still happy to be here and be a manager of a strong football team. I am happy to play the match today. ""I know there's a lot of noise around but we try our best to focus on football. ""Relief would mean we struggled with the information and the news out there. It's quite a big change from yesterday to today but we cannot influence it. We didn‚Äôt cause the situation, at the moment it seems like business, let's say football-wise, is more or less protected, but let‚Äôs see. It can change tomorrow.  ""It is not a relief for me personally, it is more joy [playing tonight]. I feel privileged to have the chance to be involved in games and coaching football, which is what I love."" Chelsea were cleared to play against Norwich with the Three logo on their shirts, but will be unable to do so for any further matches after the company's decision to cut ties with the club. The Blues' could also see deals with several other sponsors suspended, and have asked the UK government to amend their licence so that they can go back to their usual day-to-day operations and push through a sale. Cesar Azpilicueta, the current Chelsea captain, admitted that Thursday's news came as a shock but also insisted that they cannot afford to dwell on matters outside of their control. ""I have to admit that this has not been a normal day,"" he told Premier League Productions before the Norwich game.

"AFC Women's Asian Cup 2022: Australia squad, fixtures, results, table, TV schedule and online streams","The AFC Women's Asian Cup 2022 is set to kick off on January¬†20, 2022 in India. The 2022 tournament has been expanded to 12 teams, with three groups comprising of four teams each. The top two teams will directly qualify for the quarter-final stage, while the two best third-placed teams will also progress.¬† While Japan are the defending champions, the Australian team are one of the favourites to win the tournament.  They have been drawn in Group B and¬†will fight against Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia in the round-robin stage.  Australia won the competition once in 2006 and are three-times runners-up.  The Matildas had a wonderful Olympic campaign in Tokyo where they finished fourth, their best-ever performance in the history of the tournament. Although they were placed in the supposed 'Group of Death' they navigated to the knockouts as one of the best third-placed teams. In the quarterfinals, they beat Great Britain with Ellen White scoring a hat-trick. The semifinal against Sweden broke television viewing records in Australia with 2.32 million viewers tuning in. However, they went down narrowly by a goal, and also saw Sam Kerr's goal disallowed.  Following their sojourn in Japan, they have played quality sides like Brazil and world number one United States in their own backyard as part of their preparations for the AFC Women's Asian Cup.

David Beckham hands over Instagram account to doctor in Ukraine amid Russian invasion,"David Beckham handed his Instagram account over to a doctor in Ukraine on Sunday amid Russia's ongoing invasion of the country. Manchester United legend Beckham, who also won 115 caps for England as a player and is the current co-owner of MLS franchise Inter Miami, has been using his global reach on social media to raise awareness for those working on the ground in Ukraine. The 46-year-old's 71 million followers were able to see the conditions doctors have had to deal with during the military conflict as he allowed Iryna, a child anesthesiologist, to take over his social media channels at the weekend. ‚ÄúToday I‚Äôm handing over my social channels to Iryna, the Head of the Regional Perinatal Centre in Kharkiv, Ukraine where she is helping mothers give birth,"" Beckham wrote on Instagram. ""Head over to my stories to learn more about the amazing work Iryna and health workers like her are doing to save lives in Ukraine.‚Äù Iryna detailed the harrowing reality of trying to care for newborn babies in war-torn Kharkiv and recalled having to evacuate many pregnant women and mothers to the hospital basement on the first day of the invasion. ""It was a terrible three hours that we spent together,"" she said on Beckham's Instagram stories. ""Unfortunately, we can't take babies who are in intensive care to the basement because they rely on life-saving equipment. ""The first days were the most difficult. We had to learn how to work with bombings and strikes."" Iryna also shared footage and images of the conditions, adding: ""We are probably risking our lives, but we don‚Äôt think about it at all.

Only around 600 away fans made the trip up to the Riverside Stadium due to ticketing restrictions imposed by the FA prior to the quarter-final clash.  But Thomas Tuchel's men nevertheless progressed to the last four as goals from Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech sealed a routine 2-0 victory over their Championship opponents.  ""We didn't have many fans here tonight but I felt that we let our football do the talking.

Williams explains hugging Eriksen after Brentford star pulled him to the ground,"Brandon Williams has opened up on his decision to hug Christian Eriksen on the ground after the pair were involved in a brief tussle during Norwich and Brentford's Premier League clash on Saturday. The Denmark international, starting for the Bees nine months on from his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, brought down the Canaries defender with a hefty challenge, prompting an initially furious response. But upon realising who had tackled him, Williams instead hugged his opponent with a grin before helping him back to his feet - and now the Manchester United loanee has spoken out on his thoughts about the incident. ""Yeah, obviously it was a moment that just happened,"" Williams said in an interview with Sky Sports News. ""It was instinct. I got past him and I felt him pull me down. We were on the attack and I was really angry. ""I was going to hold him but then, you know what he's been through. It's incredible, what he has done [to get] back now. It was something special for him to be back on the pitch, for himself, and to be involved in that, I felt like he needed a hug. ""It's something that no player wants to go through. It was amazing that he's back. He's a top-quality player and he'll show that he'll get back to his best very soon. It was just instinct and it was something that I felt was right."" Eriksen's recovery remains one of the feelgood sport stories of the past year, sparking an outpouring of support for the former Tottenham and Inter playmaker as he embarks upon his career once more. With the Bees, he will hope to push himself into contention to feature for Denmark at the World Cup later this year, having missed out on his country's run to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 following his collapse. Williams meanwhile will face an uncertain future beyond the end of the campaign, with Norwich facing a tough fight to escape relegation and questions over whether he has a long-term career back at Old Trafford.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/williams-explains-hugging-eriksen-after-brentford-star/blt1b1e89bc23117895,Andrew Steel,c4e837e1-1d95-4f53-aa39-c290b555710c

Everton 'comfortable' of Financial Fair Play compliance after Burnley and Leeds legal threat,"Everton are ""comfortable"" that they have not broken the Premier League's Financial Fair Play rules after it was revealed that Burnley and Leeds United have written to the league over potentially major breaches. The Toffees have been accused of significantly stepping over the ¬£105 million (¬£131m) three-year threshold that teams are capped to in terms of losses. But the Merseyside outfit - who secured Premier League survival on Thursday to ensure the Clarets and the Whites must fight it out to avoid the final relegation spot to the Championship - say they have done nothing wrong. Shortly after the initial allegations were broken by The Times on Friday, Everton responded in a brief statement protesting their innocence, stating they were confident they had not broken the laws of the game.

Teams are not allowed to post losses of in excess of ¬£105m (¬£131m) over a 36-month stretch, though such financial issues incurred by the pandemic are written off. Everton claimed ¬£170m ($212m) of their total was due to Covid-19 in thier most recent statements, a figure that would still leave them seriously in breach - and could incur a points deduction if found to be so, effectively relegating them at the expense of either the Whites or the Clarets.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everton-comfortable-of-financial-fair-play-compliance-after/bltf59ff18647f3f22a,Andrew Steel,ec8a3ca8-9bb8-442a-8987-b2a03e1c0814

The crowd were treated to plenty of goalmouth action during the game, but the biggest cheer came for former England, Tottenham and Rangers midfielder Gascoigne after he came off the bench late on to score with a completely mistimed shot, albeit with a little bit of help from the opposition. üöÄ An unstoppable strike from Gazza!#WeAre150 pic.twitter.com/zQD7mjOoRo",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-paul-gascoigne-scores-hilarious-goal-rangers-world/blt4cfa15c5d5f0ddc6,James Westwood,b9d44b43-3555-4659-b176-e5e6925df71b
Can Kane convince Guardiola to revive Man City's interest in struggling Spurs striker?,"Had things gone differently, Harry Kane would be wearing a blue shirt in Manchester City's Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday evening. The England captain was at the centre of a summer-long transfer saga that ultimately ended in disappointment for both the player and the Premier League champions.  City wanted it to happen, Kane too, but Spurs held all the cards, with the striker having three years remaining on his contract, and refused to let their star leave.  Kane had made no secret of his desire to lift trophies, having failed to collect any winner's medal in his career to date, and arrived back to pre-season training later than originally scheduled.  Guardiola also confirmed City's interest and when the clubs met on the opening day of the season, Kane was sitting in the stand with his future still uncertain.  However, 10 days later, the 28-year-old revealed he would be staying in north London and, not long after, City confirmed there would be no new attackers arriving at the club.  It now seems unbelievable but missing out on their top target was a major blow for City at the time, even if they had just won the Premier League title and reached the Champions League final. They had spent much of last season without a No.9 because of injuries and illness to main man Sergio Aguero, and were understandably keen to bring in a proven goalscorer. It wasn't to be, though, and, ultimately, very little changed for anyone involved since the close of the summer transfer window.  Spurs and Kane are still struggling, while City go into Saturday's match at the Etihad nine points clear of second-placed Liverpool, and with one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals after a 5-0 victory away to Sporting CP in midweek.  ""Now you can say: 'Harry Kane didn‚Äôt come and everything is going well', but at the time I didn‚Äôt know it,"" Guardiola told reporters on Friday.  ""When we lost to Spurs and Leicester in the Community Shield, I didn‚Äôt know what would happen in the next few weeks.  ""The club gave me these players, and I‚Äôm always delighted ‚Äì and then it‚Äôs, 'What can we do together?' ""So, this is the point: maybe if we had a proper striker, we would play with a striker. But with the players we have, we have to adapt.""  Unsurprisingly, Guardiola and City have adapted incredibly well. They are level with Liverpool for most goals in the Premier League and level with Bayern Munich for most goals in the Champions League.  Despite missing the prolific front man they wanted, nearly every member of Guardiola's stellar squad is contributing to the cause, with 18 goalscorers in total, seven of whom have netted six times or more.  For Kane, though, silverware still seems as elusive as ever, with Tottenham's Europa Conference and Carabao Cup campaigns already over, and Antonio Conte's side 27 points behind City in the Premier League.  After three consecutive defeats, even finishing in the top four will be a tough task, as the Italian manager admitted only this week. Turning 29 before the start of next season, and the clock running down on his top-flight career, it still seems that the only way Kane can realise his domestic ambitions is to change clubs.  City still want a striker, of course, but the chances of  him moving to the Etihad now are slim.  Despite Kane's age and the fact that there will only be two years left on his contract this time around, Tottenham would still demand a massive fee for him.  He would not represent good value in the long term, which is precisely why City are looking at other targets.  Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland, who turns 22 in July, is a far more attractive option, particularly with a reported buyout clause of ¬£68m ($92m).  Of course, while he is the son of former City midfielder Alfe-Inge Haaland, the club are set to face intense competition for the Norwegian sensation's services, particularly from Real Madrid.  Furthermore, City added Argentina international Julian Alvarez in the January transfer window in a ¬£14 million ($18m) deal, but he will stay at River Plate until the summer at least.  ""Julian scored three goals in his last game for River and Man City made an incredible deal because he is a player who moves really well,"" Guardiola enthused. ""The club is working, watching managers, keepers, full-backs, central defenders, attacking midfielders, strikers ‚Äì it never stops. ""If you believe now we have a settled team and then five players say they want to leave, we have to be ready."" So, expect City to bring in another striker this summer, one signed to go straight into the starting line-up. It's just unlikely to be Kane. Still, he'll doubtless be looking to deliver a match-winning performance this weekend to send a timely reminder of why City were so keen to sign him just six months ago.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/can-kane-convince-guardiola-to-revive-man-city-s-interest-in/blt49f09bf01d6737e8,Jonathan Smith,f2241d82-7e6f-4a70-ba65-898fe1b4d1f6
Liverpool make Keita transfer stance clear as Klopp plans to keep midfielder amid RB Leipzig interest,"Liverpool have no intention of letting Naby Keita leave before the transfer window closes, GOAL understands, and are continuing talks with the midfielder over a new contract. The Guinea international has entered the final 12 months of his current deal at Anfield, and as yet negotiations over an extension have yet to bring about a resolution. Reports in Germany have suggested the 27-year-old is unhappy with the situation, but GOAL understands that despite interest from a number of European clubs, including RB Leipzig, Liverpool‚Äôs plan is to keep Keita, both this season and beyond. Keita joined the Reds from Leipzig in a ¬£52 million ($63m) deal in 2018, and has since made 117 appearances, scoring 11 goals. But he is yet to consistently hold down a regular starting spot, with injuries often hindering his ability to build up a rhythm. And while others - notably Mohamed Salah, Joe Gomez and Harvey Elliott - have been handed new contracts this summer, Keita‚Äôs future remains unresolved. GOAL, though, understands that talks between Liverpool and the player‚Äôs representative, Bjorn Bezemer, are ongoing. There were face-to-face discussions earlier this month in Mallorca, and the relationship between the parties is strong. If Keita is unhappy or disillusioned, then that has not been communicated to the club, and there is little chance that they would sanction a sale at this stage anyway, given the injury crisis which has overshadowed their start to the new Premier League season. The intention, rather, is to thrash out a new four-year deal with Keita, who retains the full backing of manager Jurgen Klopp and who is viewed, fully fit and at his best, as part of Liverpool‚Äôs strongest XI. Liverpool expect to have Roberto Firmino available for next Monday‚Äôs Premier League trip to Manchester United, after the Brazilian missed the draw with Crystal Palace due to a muscle issue. Firmino‚Äôs absence has been described as ‚Äúprecautionary‚Äù, but he is expected to return at Old Trafford, a welcome boost given the Reds will be missing new signing Darwin Nunez through suspension. Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson should also come into contention to start, having been used only as substitutes against Palace due to minor concerns, but Joel Matip, Ibrahima Konate, Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are all definitely out. Liverpool will wait until late in the window to make a decision on the futures of Nat Phillips and Sepp van den Berg, with one or both likely to stay as cover until January at least. Van den Berg has interest from at least three clubs, including Championship side Blackburn, while Phillips has been tracked by Bournemouth and Fulham, but concerns over the fitness of Matip and Konate mean Klopp is likely to err on the side of caution and keep one of them around.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-keita-transfer-stance-clear-klopp-rb-leipzig/bltcbf57ea7b8ceeae3,Neil Jones,1c0b8add-4d4a-4a71-9028-87e67137ae88
"Almeria's Sadiq not ruling out AS Roma return, gushes over Mourinho","Almeria striker Umar Sadiq has not ruled himself out of a return to AS Roma, although he claims his focus remains with the Rojiblancos.

He went ahead to score two goals in six appearances ‚Äì a feat that saw Roma make his move permanent. Sadly, he could not justify the club‚Äôs faith in him and that saw him sent on loan to Bologna, Torino, NAC Breda, Rangers, Perugia, and Partizan before heading to Almeria on a five-year contract. He is expected to lead Rubi‚Äôs men against Leganes on Sunday and a draw would guarantee their place in the Spanish elite division.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/almeria-sadiq-not-ruling-out-as-roma-return-gushes-over/blt6d3ed021113f63af,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,49ae0f0a-ff63-4145-b4ad-83c8014d3819

UEFA vice-president confirms South American teams set to join Nations League,"The likes of Brazil and Argentina are set to compete in the UEFA Nations League after UEFA vice-president Zbigniew Boniek confirmed South America's governing body CONMEBOL has reached an agreement with its European counterpart over joining the biennial competition. The Nations League, which began in 2018, is currently contested by UEFA‚Äôs 55 member nations. However, the 10 members of CONMEBOL are set to form part of a newly expanded competition from 2024. Asked about the proposal, Boniek told Meczyki: ‚ÄúFrom 2024 CONMEBOL will join the Nations League. ‚ÄúWe do not know yet in what formula, in what form. We signed a memorandum about cooperation between CONMEBOL and UEFA and from 2024 these teams will play in the Nations League.‚Äù Boniek added that six South American teams will join League A of the Nations League while the other four will join League B. The games are expected to be played in Europe to cut down on travel. An expanded Nations League looks to be the next step in closer relations between UEFA and CONMEBOL. The two governing bodies signed a joint agreement last week pledging to ‚Äúbroaden their existing cooperation‚Äù and develop football ""beyond their geographical zones‚Äù. The agreement also includes the opening of a joint office in London, which will be in charge of ‚Äúcoordinating projects of common interest‚Äù. The first example of this is a friendly match between Copa America winners Argentina and Euro 2020 champions Italy in June 2022, the first of three such matches between the respective continental champions. A revamped Nations League also appears to directly conflict with FIFA‚Äôs plans to hold a World Cup every two years instead of four. The Nations League at present fits around other major international tournaments, but it would clash with a World Cup if it was held every two years. UEFA and CONMEBOL have both publicly opposed FIFA's plans for more regular World Cups, with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin expressing ""grave concerns"" about the proposals earlier this year. Football's world governing body is holding a global summit on Monday to discuss the future of the game, including their plans for a biennial World Cup.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uefa-vice-president-confirms-south-american-teams-set-to/blt65a9cfc2b594f282,Tom Mallows,3d9f7ceb-c9c8-4c91-90da-b31668e1c097

"Gucci, adidas Originals, and the future of football endorsement deals: Grealish, Williamson and Rashford lead the way","Earlier this year, the football rumour mill went into overdrive. Where this kind of speculation normally means a major signing or a manager on the verge of being sacked, this time it focused on a potential endorsement deal. According to those reports, Jack Grealish was poised to sign a  seven figure deal with Gucci that would make him an ‚Äúofficial ambassador,‚Äù something described as ‚Äúpretty much unprecedented for a sportsperson.‚Äù In May, Grealish appeared to confirm the rumours in an interview with The Face. While it may have seemed an unconventional move at the time, Grealish was keen to stress how deep his ties were with the Italian luxury house, telling the story of a Gucci wash bag his dad bought him as a present for joining the Aston Villa first team. ‚ÄúI was only 16,‚Äù he told the magazine. ‚ÄúIt goes that far back!‚Äù The move doesn‚Äôt just make sense because of a 10 year old wash bag. Gucci is known for working with unexpected collaborators and ambassadors, and its ‚ÄúFriends of the House‚Äù often includes musicians (Harry Styles and Celeste), actors (Jared Leto and Dakota Johnson), artists (Ignasi Monreal and Coco Capitan) and chefs (Massimo Bottura). Even trainspotter Francis Bourgeois is a regular presence at their fashion shows. While this list shows how far and wide Gucci throws the net in terms of ambassadors, the signing of Grealish is still the first time they‚Äôve worked with a footballer. This move, therefore, gives Gucci a formal entrance into a new market ‚Äì complete with a direct line to Grealish‚Äôs rapidly growing 5.2 million Instagram followers ‚Äì and the brand followed it up by signing Lionesses‚Äô captain Leah Williamson in another ‚Äúmajor deal.‚Äù Williamson was a special guest at the Gucci Cosmonogie show, sharing her behind-the-scenes pictures with i-D magazine. Both Grealish and Williamson were obviously partly signed due to their footballing abilities, but the sponsorship deals also hinge on who they are off pitch. Williamson is the leader of a new generation of footballers, and as well as now being a European Champion is also a powerful advocate for women and girls‚Äô access to sports. This ties up with Gucci‚Äôs own ‚ÄúChime for Change‚Äù program, described as ‚Äúa global campaign to convene, unite and strengthen the voices speaking out for gender equality.‚Äù Grealish, on the other hand, has built a tight bond with fans through his down-to-earth approach, including his Premier League winning celebrations at the end of last season. Throughout his career, Grealish has been more outspoken, more up-for-a-laugh and more approachable than most Premier League or international footballers, something that would endear him to Gucci‚Äôs own ideals. In 2018, Harry Styles became the face of its tailoring campaign, with images showing him holding a chicken in his local chippy. If you had to think of one Premier League footballer willing to do that, you‚Äôd probably go for Grealish. In that sense then, both of these partnerships are driven by the players‚Äô values rather than just their reach. Gucci isn't the first luxury brand to do this with football endorsements. One of the most high-profile examples is voice-of-his-generation Marcus Rashford, who signed with Burberry to ‚Äúchampion the power of giving back.‚Äù In the statement announcing the partnership, the London-based label said that Rashford‚Äôs ‚Äúwork to support the UK‚Äôs youth sits at the heart of our partnership and embodies our commitment to community and going beyond.‚Äù Away from the direct impact of Williamson and Grealish, Gucci‚Äôs decision to enter the footballing world also helps it lead in a growing area. The overlap between fashion and football has come a long way since David James modelled for Armani in 1995, and nowadays players often attend fashion shows, and sometimes participate themselves. Hector Bellerin, in many ways the OG of the new fashion-forward generation of footballers, walked for Louis Vuitton in 2019 and Trent Alexander-Arnold appeared in a Bottega Veneta campaign in 2021. And then there‚Äôs Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has become a darling of most fashion magazines since he went to New York Fashion Week with Everton teammate Tom Davies in early 2020. This relationship extends to product as well. Brands have been keen to play with football aesthetics in their collections, most notably Balenciaga who‚Äôs football-influenced releases cover everything from black leather football boots to jerseys seemingly inspired by Borussia Dortmund away kits. Gucci also got in on the act with its adidas Originals collaboration earlier this year, which nodded to terrace culture and arrived in a campaign featuring Paul Pogba, Serge Gnabry, Jude Bellingham and David Alaba. Gucci‚Äôs partnerships with Grealish and Williamson therefore make sense in a number of different ways. On a surface level, it gives the Italian luxury house a foothold in the football industry, bringing credibility from two global talents who both have their own platforms and their own reach. Deeper than that, though, it allows Gucci to work with players who share their values. Both Grealish and Williamson are young, progressive and not scared of being themselves. In this sense, the partnership between these two footballers and one of the world‚Äôs biggest fashion houses is based on principles, not just reach. In an era where players feel more empowered than ever to stay true to themselves, this could be the future.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gucci-adidas-originals-the-future-of-football-endorsement/blt71c0c106c515a927,Jack Stanley,0d9cf14d-ed1b-4904-9f82-a696888fc77b
Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' shirt to go to auction with ¬£4 million estimated price,"The Argentina jersey that Diego Maradona wore when he scored the controversial 'hand of God' goal against England in the 1986 World Cup is up for sale at an auction. The late legend put in a masterclass performance as he guided his side to the semi-finals of the competition with a 2-1 win against the Three Lions in Mexico. Maradona scored what is considered the ""goal of the century"" as he ran through the England team before slotting into the net, but his other goal caught attention for all the wrong reasons as he used his hand to beat Peter Shilton to the ball and send it into the net. The shirt the Argentina icon was wearing in that clash is now set to go to auction later this month. Sotheby's will hold the auction for Maradona's jersey and is set to go for a huge price, which is expected to be at least ¬£4 million ($5m) and possibly as much as ¬£6m ($8m).

How has Tottenham star Son become a Premier League Golden Boot contender?,"It speaks volumes that on the day of Arsenal‚Äôs trip to take on Tottenham, the player the visitors most fear is not the man with 11 goals in 14 games against them, Harry Kane. Instead, ahead of the most crucial North London Derby in years, it his his forward partner who will have been giving Mikel Arteta nightmares. There is no greater compliment to Son Heung-min, whose 27 goal contributions this season places him second in the Premier League charts behind Mohamed Salah. Twenty of those have been goals, making him the league‚Äôs top non-penalty goalscorer and leaves him just two behind Salah in the running for the Golden Boot. Son has always been a little under-rated, his highlights reel and hard-working attitude for some reason failing to grab enough attention outside of Tottenham. It is certainly strange that Son has not been the subject of record-breaking transfer bids in the same way that Kane has.¬† Finally, though, he is getting the attention he deserves thanks to those goalscoring numbers shooting up significantly over the last two years. Across all competitions, his 21 goals this season is a joint-career high, level with his 2020-21 performance, but achieved in eight fewer matches. The reason for Son‚Äôs improvements are largely tactical. Under a series of counterattacking managers, from Jose Mourinho through to Antonio Conte, Son‚Äôs role has changed significantly from the days when he was part of a possession-centric side, and Tottenham‚Äôs new way of playing is better suited to the South Korean‚Äôs skill set. Beginning with Mourinho and taken up, with wildly different success rates, by Nuno Espirito Santo and Conte, Spurs have spent the last three years as a team with a deeper base line than most big clubs. The focus is on making use of transitions ‚Äì when the ball is turned over ‚Äì to break quickly into space, as opposed to pressing high and focusing on dominating possession. Although this is a rather broad description of what separates Mourinho, Nuno, and Conte from most other ‚ÄòBig Six‚Äô managers such as Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp, Thomas Tuchel, or Arteta, it is a helpful way to appreciate how Son‚Äôs role has shifted. Whereas under Mauricio Pochettino, when Son would expect to get hold of the ball in the final third, taking part in a longer phase of build-up play that means he is facing an opponent chiefly sat behind the ball, now he collects possession in deeper areas and is part of a three-pronged attack to counter at speed. Naturally, this suits Son‚Äôs brilliant dribbling and acceleration, as well as his unusually high technical ability while running at pace. And while Tuchel or Klopp, for example, would be equally keen to utilise these qualities, they would do so from high turnovers, not from the deeper shape that a succession of managers at Tottenham have deployed. This is captured neatly in the statistics. As the table below shows, Son is passing longer and more vertically season on season, while the number of passes made while under pressure has dramatically reduced over the last two years.  Progressive distance of passes, per 90 Long passes completed, per 90 Passes made while under pressure, per 90 2017-18 93.9 1.25 7.94 2018-19 87.6 1.67 7.36 2019-20 92.6 1.89 7.31 2020-21 93.8 2.54 5.92 2021-22 105.2 2.42 5.42 This points to instructions for Son to be more direct, but also to him receiving the ball in larger amounts of space. That second point is crucial. With more space in which to work, and bearing down on the defence while on the counter, Son is far more productive. The second part of the tactical shift from which Son has benefitted is the adapted role of Kane, something first started by Mourinho and (reluctantly) taken up by Conte. Mourinho, never one to coach attacking players with much detail, gave Kane the freedom to do whatever he wanted, which led to Tottenham‚Äôs number 10 acting like one. Initially Kane dropping deeper worked well for Mourinho, although over time it left them short on players in the final third. Conte has gone on record saying he would like to sign a creative midfielder so that Kane can focus on playing as a striker, but for now he has embraced what Mourinho (then Nuno) discovered ‚Äì albeit with greater tactical specificity. What we see now is Son complimenting Kane‚Äôs movement by making runs on the shoulder of the last defender. Essentially the two players have swapped around, leaving Son as the de facto number nine.  Shot accuracy Goals per shot on target Distance per shot (metres) Total goals Expected goals (xG) 2017-18 45.9% 0.35 16.0 12 10.4 2018-19 37.8% 0.43 18.9 12 7.6 2019-20 48.1% 0.28 16.6 11 8.9 2020-21 51.5% 0.46 17.0 17 10.3 2021-22 52% 0.51 15.8 20 13.4 He scored four goals in 13 league games under Nuno this season (0.3 per game) and 17 goals in 29 (0.6 per game) under Conte. Son has embraced this change and become a clinical centre forward in the process.

'Nobody would have given us the title if we won' - Chelsea boss Tuchel plays down West Ham upset,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel played down the significance of his side's shock 3-2 defeat to West Ham United on Saturday, while admitting that they could not afford to keep making mistakes if they want to remain in title contention.  The Blues led twice against their London rivals before going down to substitute Arthur Masuaku's winner three minutes from the end.  That defeat could now see them knocked off the Premier League summit, depending on results elsewhere.  ""We hate to lose, we have to digest it now,"" Tuchel explained to Match of the Day after the final whistle.  ""It is not a performance to be mad about, but in detail we need to be better again.  ""If we won the game nobody would have given us the title and if we lose it I don't think anybody else gets it this weekend."" Masuaku's winner came from what appeared to be a mishit cross that flew past Edouard Mendy in the Chelsea net.  Earlier Manuel Lanzini and Jarrod Bowen both hit to peg back Chelsea, who took the advantage on two occasions through Thiago Silva and Mason Mount; and Tuchel affirmed that his charges paid the price for their errors throughout the game. ""This is a goal that OK, happens, it happens because it happens, there are no mistakes, just a freak goal - the problem is that it is the winner,"" he added. ""We had too many mistakes before in our game because the performance was OK, we created half chances and were in control. Overall we did too many individual mistakes. If you do this for three consecutive games you cannot expect always to get a result. ""This will not change, the schedule is the schedule and we need to overcome tiredness, mentally and physically, otherwise we have an excuse. We did not get a gift today from West Ham and they also played Europa League in between.  ""The schedule we play and effort we play, sometimes you feel tired, but you just need to accept it and control our risk management.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nobody-would-have-given-us-the-title-if-we-won-chelsea-boss/bltcc61d8d20d413f95,GOAL,936c961a-5be3-4d00-aa7b-ae4151b146c5
Rooney's Derby County relegated from Championship after QPR loss and Reading's dramatic comeback victory,"Derby County and manager Wayne Rooney will play in League One next season after the Rams were relegated from the Championship thanks to both their 1-0 loss to Queens Park Rangers and a superb Reading comeback for a 4-4 draw against Swansea. The Rams headed into their Easter Monday clash knowing that they had to avoid defeat at Loftus Road and hope that the Royals would fail to tame the Swans elsewhere in the second tier. But an 88th-minute Luke Amos goal and an injury-time dismissal for Tom Lawrence ended Rooney and Co.'s hopes of earning a result, while Tom McIntyre struck deep into stoppage time for Reading to seal a remarkable fightback that lifted them beyond Derby's reach with three games to go. The odds have been stacked against the Rams this season, after they were handed a combined 21-point deduction for falling into administration. Having stepped away from the playing squad and taken charge at Pride Park following the exit of Phillip Cocu last season, Rooney managed to steer the club from the foot of the table to dodge relegation last season by the skin of his teeth. But with a huge margin to make up this term, Derby - who otherwise would have been set for a likely mid-table finish with their missing points - have been battling against the tide, and ultimately have come up short in their quest to stay in the second tier.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rooney-s-derby-county-relegated-from-championship-after-qpr-loss-/blt0394cbd1f6ea8507,Andrew Steel,d8e6627b-33ef-4e8f-b4fd-be880e9551f9
PSG to replace sporting director Leonardo with Luis Campos following Mbappe extension,"GOAL can confirm that Paris Saint-Germain are set to sack Leonardo after Kylian Mbappe's transfer U-turn, with a formal announcement expected in the coming days. Leonardo has served as PSG's sporting director for the past three years, playing a key role in recruitment as the club has continued its dominance of French football while also fighting for a maiden Champions League crown. The Ligue 1 champions are planning a summer of wholesale changes, however, with Leonardo among those being touted for an exit following a turbulent 2021-22 campaign. PSG's first priority was to tie Mbappe down to a contract extension amid reported interest in his services from Real Madrid. The 23-year-old pushed for a move to Santiago Bernabeu in 2021 and was widely tipped to join the Blancos on a free transfer this summer, but has instead reaffirmed his commitment to PSG. Mbappe signed a bumper new deal at Parc des Princes on Saturday that ties him to the club until 2025, but GOAL understands that Leonardo did not have any influence on the final negotiations. It has been reported that the pair did not always see eye to eye and Mbappe did not want to continue with Leonardo in the boardroom, with PSG appearing to bow to his wishes. PSG have already identified a replacement for Leonardo, with GOAL confirming that former Lille and Monaco sporting director Luis Campos was present in Paris last week. Campos was at Monaco when Mbappe first broke onto the senior stage as he helped deliver the club Ligue 1 title success in 2016-17. He subsequently took up a similar role at Lille, who won the French top-flight last season, but he is now a free agent and Mbappe is reportedly eager for a reunion at Parc des Princes.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-to-replace-sporting-director-leonardo-with-luis-campos/bltec2d205b2525bd50,Marc Mechenoua,e71e701b-38c7-430b-bb56-5f2015d1f626
Rooney could be awarded 'Freedom of Derby' honour by local council,"Wayne Rooney could be awarded the 'Freedom of Derby' honour by a local council in recognition of his work as manager of the city's football club. Rooney initially inherited the managerial reins at Pride Park on a caretaker basis following Derby's poor start to the 2020-21 season, and was handed a permanent contract after pulling them clear of the relegation zone. The former Manchester United and England striker's first full campaign as Rams boss got off to a nightmare start as the club was plunged into administration with a points deduction last September, but he remained loyal and did his best to keep the team in the Championship. The Freedom of the City honour is awarded to either an individual or military unit in acknowledgement of their outstanding service to the city. Should¬†councillors approve calls for him to receive the award, Rooney will follow in the footsteps of past winners such as Derby legend Brian Clough and the club's former winger Reg Harrison. The motion for Rooney to be considered, which was called by councillor Steve Hassall, reads: ""It has not gone unnoticed that Wayne Rooney has been steadfast in his loyalty, support and determination to ensure he and the team remain committed to both the club and fans. ""Wayne Rooney has demonstrated that his integrity, passion and unquestionable loyalty for Derby County Football Club, fans and the city is absolute and we could not have asked for a better figurehead to champion our cause and lead in all senses of the word, during such perilous times. ""To Wayne Rooney, this city gives its wholehearted thanks and in recognition of our gratitude we would like to bestow one of our oldest and highest honours to someone we are all proud to say is one of our own. Wayne Rooney you are a Ram."" Derby were deducted 12 points after entering into administration, but that total rose to 21 in November as the club was punished for breaches of the English Football League‚Äôs profitability and sustainability rules under ex-owner Mel Morris. Rooney's side had a mountain to climb in order to avoid the drop as a result, but a strong run of form between January and February gave supporters a brief glimmer of hope that the Rams could pull off a great escape. Unfortunately, Derby were unable to maintain their run, and their relegation to League One was confirmed following a 1-0 defeat at QPR on April 18. Rooney said he was ""proud"" of his players for their efforts throughout the season, though, and it has been reported that he will stay on as manager as long as a proposed takeover goes through in the coming weeks.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rooney-could-be-awarded-freedom-of-derby-honour-by-local/bltfb40827c87f454e5,James Westwood,6a5f7f7d-8682-4fa2-b9e4-a620af151491
James Rodriguez: I'd take pay cut to join Cavani at Valencia,"WHAT HAPPENED? The former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich star is keen to return to Europe after a season in the Middle East with Al-Rayyan. In the knowledge that Valencia need to bring in reinforcements to account for the departure of PSG-bound Carlos Soler, Rodriguez offered himself to Gennaro Gattuso. WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to El Chiringuito, the 31-year-old said: ""If Valencia call me I will even walk from Qatar. I would take a pay cut. If they need someone to assist Edinson Cavani, I‚Äôll be there. They are a great club with great fans.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Valencia are very short on time to replace Soler who has been one of their stand-out players in the last few years.

"'Superstar' Ibrahimovic still being so good shouldn't actually be possible, says former Sweden team-mate Johansson","Zlatan Ibrahimovic is ""still so good"" and ""a superstar"", according to his former Sweden team-mate Jacob Johansson, who claims ""it shouldn't actually be possible"" for him to still be performing to such a high standard at the age of 40. Ibrahimovic has enjoyed a stellar career spanning over two decades, with successful spells taken in at a whole host of clubs including Juventus, Inter, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United. The veteran striker, who is currently taking in a second spell at AC Milan, is also Sweden's all-time record scorer and Johansson is in awe of the longevity he's had at the very highest level of the game. The former Sweden international played alongside Ibrahimovic for three years before the enigmatic forward announced his decision to retire from national team duty in 2016. Ibrahimovic performed a u-turn in March last year and is available for selection for Sweden's remaining World Cup qualifying fixtures, and Johansson believes he is still capable of being the difference maker despite his advancing years. ""Zlatan speaks for himself, he needs no introduction. He‚Äôs been a superstar for two decades and it‚Äôs unbelievably impressive that he‚Äôs still so good,"" the former AEK Athens and Rennes midfielder told FIFA.com. ""It shouldn‚Äôt actually be possible. He‚Äôs been battling with injuries recently, but we all know Zlatan. Anything is possible when he‚Äôs on the pitch. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs a superstar."" Ibrahimovic has struggled for fitness throughout the 2021-22 campaign, missing a total of 15 games. Despite his injury woes, the Swede has still scored eight goals in 21 appearances, and returned to action after two months on the sidelines with an Achilles tendon problem earlier this month. Milan have been boosted in their push for the Serie A title by Ibrahimovic's return and he will be in line to feature once again when they take in a trip to Cagliari on Sunday. After that fixture, Ibrahimovic will hope for another call-up to the Sweden national team ahead of their World Cup qualifying play-off against the Czech Republic on March 24.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ibrahimovic-still-being-so-good-shouldn-t-actually-be/blt804801a2bd6a673a,James Westwood,0aece1b4-60ae-45f8-90a8-9b670d4d34c5
Ramos to miss Real Madrid reunion through injury as PSG confirm absence for Champions League clash,"Sergio Ramos has seen an imminent reunion with Real Madrid ruled out, with Paris Saint-Germain revealing that a calf injury will force the former Blancos captain to miss the first leg of an eagerly-anticipated Champions League last-16 tie. The 35-year-old defender departed Santiago Bernabeu in the summer of 2021 and headed to Parc des Princes as a free agent. He had been due to cross paths with some familiar faces in a heavyweight European encounter on Tuesday, but any plans to line up against a side he represented with distinction for 16 years have been put on hold for now. A statement from PSG on the club‚Äôs official website reads: ‚ÄúSergio Ramos will continue his individual training for his calf injury. A new evaluation will be made in a week.‚Äù The World Cup winner had previously stated that he was looking forward to locking horns with Real and would be giving everything he has to the cause of new employers. Ramos said in December after learning of an emotional draw: ""You know the affection and love I have for Real Madrid. ""Now it's my turn to defend PSG and I'll do everything possible to do it. It's the team that bet on me. I'm going to die for PSG. ""I would have liked not to have that confrontation [with Real Madrid], but returning to the Santiago Bernabeu is cause for joy [because] I could not have a real farewell because of Covid restrictions."" Ramos arrived at PSG nursing a calf complaint and missed 19 games at the start of the 2021-22 campaign as a result. He did not make his debut for Ligue 1 giants until November 28, and was sent off on his second appearance against Lorient. Just four outings have been taken in by the legendary centre-half, but he finds himself back on the treatment table. After overcoming more muscular problems in late November, another calf problem has him laid low. Fitness setbacks have become a familiar theme for Ramos, as the end of his time in Madrid also saw regular spells taken in on the sidelines. It remains to be seen how long his latest ailment will take to shake, with PSG due at the Bernabeu on March 9.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ramos-miss-real-madrid-reunion-injury-psg-champions-league/blta1304e78b4a87d12,Chris Burton,be3faa56-2d3b-4b68-be12-825a3f2ed9f2
Dybala explains rejecting No.10 at Roma - but admits 'one day' he may wear Totti's iconic number,"After Paulo Dybala completed his transfer to Roma, he was offered the No. 10 jersey. But the Argentine refused it out of respect to club legend Francesco Totti. Instead, he chose to wear No. 21 for the upcoming season, the same digit that he had at Juventus.  The attacking midfielder is already in Portugal where the Giallorossi are holding their pre-season training camp under the guidance of coach Jose Mourinho. After signing a three-year contract with an option for a fourth, Dybala is eager to propel Roma back to Champions League after last season's Europa Conference League success. Dybala wanted to stick to 21, a number he is attached to, as he knows the responsibility and pressure that comes with the No. 10 jersey at Roma.  ""The director had suggested that I take 10, which is very important here for what Totti has done. That shirt must still be his. I thanked them, because for such a shirt there must be respect and responsibility,"" he stated.  ""Maybe one day I'll wear it, but today I'm happy with 21. It's a number I'm tied to and with which I started to win."" üÜï ùó™ùóòùóüùóñùó¢ùó†ùóò | Paulo Dybala üê∫üá¶üá∑The club is delighted to confirm the signing of the world-renowned forward!We also hope this video can help continue to raise awareness in the search for missing children all around the globe. üôè #ASRoma | @ICMEC_official pic.twitter.com/eb0TXYXamk Dybala revealed that Mourinho called him and explained his ideas which convinced him to choose Roma ahead of other options like Inter and AC Milan.  ""It was a lot of things. The call of the coach and the manager and the talk with the owners. They were very important things that gave me so many certainties. The coach was one of the main causes, he was clear with his ideas.  ""We all know him for what he has done and for what he will do.¬†We talked a lot, it was a good chat.¬†I was lucky enough to play with the greatest players in history and now I can say that I also work with one of the best coaches."" Roma are set to play a friendly against Tottenham at the Sammy Ofer Stadium in Israel on July 30. But it is unlikely that Dybala will play any part in that game as he has just started to train with his new team-mates.  Nonetheless, Dybala minced no words to express his goal for the club which is to win silverware. He is working hard to regain his physical fitness and it is likely that he would make his debut on August 15 in a Serie A fixture against Salernitana. ""I want to get back in shape, to contribute to the team. I want to be able to help Roma continue to win. They achieved a great mentality last year, the same one that the coach has.

"Liverpool vs Leicester City: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Liverpool will be aiming to return to winning ways when they welcome Leicester City to Anfield for Wednesday‚Äôs Carabao Cup clash. The Reds were held to a 2-2 draw away to Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday, bringing to an end their run of eight consecutive victories. However, Liverpool are 4/6 (1.67) favourites with bet365 to bounce straight back by securing their place in the semi-finals for the first time since 2017 with a win. Brendan Rodgers‚Äô Leicester ran out 3-1 winners at the King Power Stadium in the most recent encounter between the sides back in February but are 15/4 (4.75) outsiders to come out on top here. The hosts‚Äô last two EFL Cup games at this stadium have both resulted in draws, and you can get odds of 31/10 (4.10) on this clash also heading to a penalty shootout following a deadlocked 90 minutes. Mohamed Salah is the 3/1 (4.0) favourite to open the scoring after hitting the net 22 times in 24 fixtures this season, with Diogo Jota priced at 11/2 (6.50) following goals in his last two games. Jamie Vardy is the visitors' 13/2 (7.50) front runner to break the deadlock against an opponent he has fired past eight times in 13 previous meetings, while James Maddison is a tempting 14/1 (15.0) outside bet after scoring in four of his last six fixtures. With fixtures coming thick and fast and having lost a number of key players due to injury and Covid-19 recently, Jurgen Klopp is likely to give his youngsters and fringe players a runout in this clash. This should make for an open match against a Foxes side that have provided plenty of goalmouth action at both ends recently - keeping just one clean sheet in 17 fixtures but scoring 16 times themselves in the most recent six. With 14 goals scored in the last four meetings between this pair, odds of 6/4 (2.50) are well worth backing on over 3.5 goals going in for Liverpool‚Äôs seventh home game in 11, as well as a sixth match in seven for Leicester.

"'Man, he's fast' - Pulisic reveals how he tried to keep up with Kante before scoring Chelsea's second goal vs Lille","Christian Pulisic has revealed how he tried to keep up with N'Golo Kante before scoring Chelsea's second goal against Lille on Tuesday night. The Blues took a huge step towards the Champions League quarter-finals by beating Lille 2-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Kai Havertz opened the scoring in the eighth minute and Pulisic wrapped up the victory for Thomas Tuchel's side in the second half, but it was Kante who left Stamford Bridge with the man-of-the-match award. Kante made a huge contribution in both defence and attack throughout the 90 minutes, and provided the assist for Pulisic's decisive strike just after the hour mark. The Frenchman picked the ball up deep inside his own half before racing down the other end and playing a neat ball into the United States' international's path, and he then produced a cool finish past Leonardo Jardim in the Lille net.

'I prefer to stay with Barcelona' - De Jong responds to Manchester United transfer links,"Frenkie de Jong has responded to the rumours linking him with a transfer to Manchester United, with the midfielder admitting that he would ""prefer to stay with Barcelona"". De Jong moved to Barca from Ajax for ¬£65 million ($82m) in 2019 and has since established himself as a key member of the squad, featuring in 139 games across all competitions. The 25-year-old is under contract at Camp Nou until 2026, but it has been reported that the Blaugrana may be forced to sell him this summer as they continue to try and reduce their wage bill. United have been tipped to close a deal for De Jong amid reports that Barca are prepared to let him go if they can recoup their initial investment in the midfielder. De Jong has only managed to win one trophy in the form of the Copa Del Rey in his three years at Camp Nou, but has no regrets about joining the Spanish giants and would like to stay put for the foreseeable future.

'No problems' - Fernandes embraces Man Utd's new discipline approach under Ten Hag,"Bruno Fernandes says he and his Manchester United team-mates have ""no problems"" with their refreshed, disciplined approach under new boss Erik ten Hag, with the Portuguese playmaker suggesting that the results are already there for supporters and rivals to see. Ten Hag moved into the Old Trafford dugout at the end of a turbulent 2021-22 season and has set about remoulding the Red Devils in his own image - albeit without several of the transfer targets the former Ajax boss had hoped to bring on-board But that has not stopped a promising pre-season response from United under his watch, with three wins from three on their summer tour to date. Fernandes has pointed to a more concentrated off-field approach as key to the promising mood in the dressing room. Speaking ahead of Saturday's final clash in Australia - against Aston Villa in Perth - the Portugal international indicated that Ten Hag ran a tighter ship than predecessors Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, with fines handed out for players late to team meetings and events. ""We missed that for a while and discipline is important,"" he stated. ""Discipline is not only the way you play, the position that you have, what you have to do, it‚Äôs also off the pitch. Don‚Äôt be late for the meetings, don‚Äôt be late for the meals. ""That‚Äôs really important because if everyone is on time and someone comes late, he should be punished. That‚Äôs really good that he‚Äôs doing that and amazing, because I like to be on time, so I won‚Äôt have problems with that."" One major absentee from Ten Hag's squad as they tour the southern hemisphere has been striker Cristiano Ronaldo, who withdrew from the tour, citing family reasons, amid reports he is pushing for an exit from the club this summer. Fernandes however has refused to be drawn on his club and international team-mate's future, adding:  ""I don‚Äôt want to be involved in that. Obviously we have to respect the decision of everyone. I don‚Äôt know what Cristiano said to the club, to the manager, but we have to respect his space. ""The only thing I asked Cristiano, when he didn‚Äôt turn up, was if everything was OK with the family. He told me what was going on, that‚Äôs it and nothing more.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fernandes-embraces-man-utd-new-discipline-approach-under-ten/blt1f2dd63d205c66cb,Andrew Steel,adff6fda-c7ed-4587-bbc6-a4157813a2be
'Their beautiful friendship' - Atalanta duo Malinovskyi & Miranchuk remain close despite Ukraine-Russia conflict,"Ukrainian midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi and Russian midfielder Aleksey Miranchuk have formed a ""beautiful friendship"" as team-mates at Atalanta despite the ongoing military conflict between their countries, according to full-back Davide Zappacosta. Both players have been proponents of peace following the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. On Thursday, they played in a 3-2 Europa League victory over Bayer Leverkusen, with Malinovskyi scoring the opening goal and celebrating with a point to the sky dedicated to war victims. ""At this moment the situation is not easy for anyone, we could not imagine it would come to this,"" said Zappacosta to Sky Sport Italia. ""We try to stay close to them, who are great friends. Their beautiful friendship should be shown as an example to those who are fighting this senseless war.""

We spend a lot of time watching what's going on, the whole club is affected. For me personally this has shaken me more than Covid which was very bad in Bergamo.

"Atletico Madrid 'didn't expect' Trippier to leave for Newcastle, admits Savic","Atletico Madrid defender Stefan Savic has admitted the departure of Kieran Tripper ""changed"" the team as the Spanish giants have had to adjust to the defender's move to Newcastle. Trippier became the first marquee signing of Newcastle's new era in January, making the move back to the Premier League in a ¬£12 million deal that marked the first completed transfer under their new Saudi owners. The England international started strong before picking up what may be a season-ending injury, and a key player for his former club says his departure has impacted them in a big way. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs changed us, that‚Äôs for sure. We didn‚Äôt expect him to leave, but that opportunity arose and we have to accept it,"" Savic told AS. ‚ÄúWe have brought [Daniel] Wass, who was unlucky enough to get injured in the first game, and we have [Sime] Vrsaljko, who is important to us, he is physically well and can help us a lot. ‚ÄúWe also have [Marcos] Llorente, who can cover that position and with the return of Wass we will be well covered on the side.‚Äù Trippier started life at Newcastle with a bang with two goals in his first four Premier League appearances.

Bedlam at the Emirates! Arsenal seize Champions League destiny after Lacazette late show,"The Arsenal fans inside the Emirates celebrated like they had just won the Champions League. They hadn‚Äôt, of course, but they may well have just taken a giant stride back towards Europe‚Äôs elite club competition. For 82 frustrating minutes against Wolves it looked like Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side were going to blow their big chance to seize the initiative in the battle for the top four. Trailing to an early Hwang See-Chan strike, Arsenal battered constantly on the visitors‚Äô door without finding a way through. Wolves resisted attack after attack and seemed on course to seal the win they needed to move above Arsenal in the table. But then the game turned on its head in thrilling fashion. Nicolas Pepe, who had just come on, finally found a way through the Wolves rearguard to equalise and then - five minutes into stoppage time - Alexandre Lacazette‚Äôs effort was palmed into his own net by Wolves keeper Jose Sa. It was bedlam at the Emirates. Fans, who 15 minutes earlier thought they would be heading home reflecting on defeat, were embracing in the walkways celebrating what could be three huge points in the context of Arsenal's season. 90+5. ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE. pic.twitter.com/F8xWqso19f Instead of sitting seventh in the Premier League and wasting a golden opportunity to take advantage of Tottenham‚Äôs slip up at Burnley, they sit fifth, just one point behind Manchester United with two games in hand. Arteta‚Äôs side now have their Champions League destiny firmly in their own grasp. Whether they go on to secure their spot in the top four remains to be seen, but there‚Äôs no doubt this was a massive night for the Gunners. They have now won three games in a row in the Premier League since their winless January, beating Wolves twice in the process. Arteta had called for a response after his team‚Äôs disappointing start to 2022 and he has certainly got one. And the manner of this latest victory, secured in the most dramatic of fashion, can only add to the sense of momentum that is starting to build in North London. Arsenal fell behind after just 10 minutes against Wolves when Hwang seized upon Gabriel‚Äôs slack back pass to round Aaron Ramsdale and score. It was the worst possible start against a side who do not give up goals easily. ‚úä With us until the last minuteüòç Thank you, Gooners pic.twitter.com/RQpjmg6Bws Chances to equalise came and went, with Gabriel Martinelli, Lacazette, Ben White and Bukayo Saka all having efforts before the break. But the longer they went without scoring, the more you felt it was not going to be Arsenal‚Äôs night. Wolves, who have not lost in the last 45 Premier League matches in which they had opened the scoring, were looking resilient. But the introduction of Pepe and Eddie Nketiah changed things and it was the two substitutes who combined to draw Arsene level on 82 minutes, with Nketiah setting up Pepe for the equaliser. Suddenly, the Emirates believed again and they got their grandstand finish five minutes into stoppage time when¬†Lacazette broke through and fired in an effort which Sa could only turn into his own net. It was a huge moment for Arsenal as the subsequent celebrations demonstrated. The Champions League dream is very much alive.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bedlam-at-the-emirates-arsenal-seize-champions-league/bltd59dd6de629125b0,Charles Watts,924917c0-34cb-4cbe-870d-5c91be49622a
"Agents say: 'Don't pay Shakhtar' - Football exploiting Russia-Ukraine war, claims club's chief executive","Football agents have been accused of attempting to exploit the war in Ukraine for their own profit by Shakhtar chief executive Sergei Palkin.  Ukrainian football has been rocked by Russia's invasion of the Eastern European country in February. FIFA sought to make it easy for foreign players to leave teams in Ukraine outside of the regular transfer window by introducing temporary regulations allowing them to arrange transfers elsewhere. FIFA has decided to extend those rules by a further year, allowing players and coaches to suspend their deals until 2023. Palkin has argued that FIFA's latest ruling has weakened Ukrainian teams and opened up an opportunity for agents to exploit them. He told The Athletic: ""Some agents are destroying us. They are trying to steal players. They play games, contacting clubs, saying don‚Äôt pay us and deals are being broken. You cannot imagine what is going on. ""Agents are arriving to clubs and saying: 'Don‚Äôt pay Shakhtar, the players will become free, just pay me (the agent) ‚Ç¨10 million and forget about the club'. ‚ÄúThe power to decide on suspension of the contracts is now in the hands of players' agents. It doesn't reflect the club's intention to save players and investments. ""And we now basically have nine days to agree with our players their sale or loan to foreign clubs, which is just impossible.  ""FIFA has not helped Ukrainian clubs by issuing regulations. On the contrary, it significantly worsened our negotiations with players and made agents even more powerful and richer."" FIFA confirmed on Tuesday that the temporary rules had been extended, stating: ""Should clubs affiliated to the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF) or the Football Union of Russia (FUR) not reach a mutual agreement with their respective foreign players and coaches before or on 30 June 2022, and unless otherwise agreed in writing, these players and coaches will have the right to suspend their employment contracts with their clubs until 30 June 2023.

Zaha: Crystal Palace's Vieira considering new position for Ivory Coast star,"Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira has discussed why he is considering a new position for Ivory Coast international Wilfried Zaha. The Ivorian, at times, has been fielded as a central striker this season, and the French tactician believes the star can be convinced to change positions. ""I have to convince him and that will take time, but that is a position that I believe he can play,"" Vieira explained, as quoted by the club‚Äôs official website. ""He‚Äôs really strong at holding the ball, he is capable of linking the game and he can drop in the midfield.""

With a total of 12 goals this season, Zaha is currently ranked joint seventh in the Premier League goalscoring table and he is also the team's top league scorer. Meanwhile, Vieira praised the impact Crystal Palace academy products like Tyrick Mitchell have had this season. ""We knew that we had a couple of challenges with young players coming through,"" he added. ""I‚Äôm not going to lie to you: I‚Äôm satisfied and really happy with where we are on the table, but I‚Äôm more satisfied with the performance that we had. ""[I‚Äôm] satisfied as well with how those young players performed this season. Of course, it‚Äôs not finished yet, and we want to finish the league well."" Furthermore, he hinted that some of the young players would get more minutes in the remaining games. ""Of course, there are some young players that have been with us a couple of times this season that will get involved in the last couple of games we have,"" the tactician concluded.

'The owners want to win' - Man Utd boss Ten Hag addresses Glazer protests and Ronaldo future,"Erik ten Hag has called for unity in the face of planned anti-Glazer protests from Manchester United fans - insisting the hated American owners want success for the club. Furious supporters intend to voice their anger with demonstrations ahead of Monday's clash with Liverpool.  But Ten Hag insists the whole club have to stick together if they are are to turn around their disastrous start to the season.  Ten Hag on the Glazers: I can only say the owners want to win and the fans, we want them behind the club. I can understand (anger) sometimes - but I am not that long in the club to see all the background. We have to fight together and be unified. #mufc United fans have increased calls for the Glazer family to sell after back-to-back defeats have left them bottom of the table after two weeks of the 2022-23 Premier League campaign.  The #EmptyOldTrafford message has been shared on social media, with supporters planning to show their anger ahead of the meeting with fiercest rivals Liverpool.  But Ten Hag risked a backlash, by saying: ""I can only say the owners want to win and the fans, we want them behind the club. ""I can understand sometimes (the anger) but I am not that long in the club to see all the background. We have to fight together and be unified."" There is growing belief the Glazers are prepared to sell, with billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe confirming his intention to buy them out. As well as the disastrous start to the season, fans are furious about United's lack of transfer business this summer.  But Ten Hag is set to complete the signing of Casemiro from Real Madrid, with the Brazil international making clear his intention to move to Old Trafford in a deal worth around ¬£51 million ($60m) plus add-ons.  Ten Hag would not confirm the 30-year-old's imminent arrival. The United manager was also unclear on the future of Cristiano Ronaldo, with the club understood to now be prepared to listen to offers for the want-away Portuguese legend. ""He's in our plans, that's what I can say,"" said the Dutchman, who added there had been unfair focus on Ronaldo after last week's 4-0 defeat to Brentford.

Ten Hag cancelled United's day off on Sunday, in response to the performance at Brentford.  And he made it clear that he will not accepts a repeat performance against Liverpool.  ""It starts with yourself,"" he said. ""Act as a team, follow the rules and principles and work hard, as hard as you can maximise and if you do that you can get confidence. ""Every game is different, a different approach, philosophy but the plan will be the same. ""Obviously a lot went wrong, but we don't have to talk about anything when the attitude is not right. ""First, I look at it myself and make a clear analysis. I take some notice of some criticism. Some is really good, good advice, but also some is not that good.

'Italy won when nobody believed!' - Mancini 'not worried' about out-of-form players ahead of World Cup play-off,"Roberto Mancini says he is optimistic about Italy's chances of qualifying for the World Cup despite the club form of some of his side's players.

The Euro 2020 winners will meet North Macedonia on March 24, with the winner going on to meet either Portugal or Turkey in the final qualifying clash.

""We must think about what we did to have more self-confidence, the team is solid and with quality."" The Italy manager is hoping to win a second major tournament in a row. The country beat England on penalties to win the Euro 2020 final and the coach says his side are determined to claim another trophy this year.

Messi's debut for PSG had to be delayed due to the short turnaround between the start of the 2021-22 season and the end of the Copa America, in which he helped Argentina land the first international trophy of his career. The 34-year-old has only managed four goals and three assists in his first 12 outings for Mauricio Pochettino's side, including just one in Ligue 1. Messi's latest blank came during the 1-1 draw with Lens, but he will likely have the chance to improve his tally when PSG take on Club Brugge in the Champions League on Tuesday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-cold-weather-france-barcelona-suarez/blt6a55eda04604607f,James Westwood,951c49e3-7208-4d41-afae-e772312ef6d2
"Jurgen Klopp 'I'm so glad' chant: Lyrics, meaning and inspiration behind Liverpool fans' song","Liverpool supporters are among the most passionate and vocal in English football, and a list of terrace chants continues to grow with each passing season. New heroes rise to prominence on a regular basis and fans need to see their achievements recognised and acknowledged in the stands. Reds boss Jurgen Klopp ‚Äì as a Champions League and Premier League title-winning coach ‚Äì has always been a fan favourite and boasts plenty of songs. Another ode to the German tactician has been added to the Merseyside playlist, but what is it and how can you join in? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ The song is sung to the tune of the famous Beatles track, ‚ÄòI Feel Fine‚Äô and goes: I'm so glad that Jurgen is a Red.I'm so glad he delivered what he said.Jurgen said to me, you know. We'll win the Premier League, you know. He said so.I'm in love with him and I feel fine.

Reds followers are merely looking to express their appreciation for the work overseen by one of world‚Äôs football‚Äôs finest managers. Klopp did state, in his very first press conference, that he had the tools at his disposal to deliver tangible success while in charge at Anfield, saying: ‚ÄúIf we sit here in four years I think we win a title, I‚Äôm pretty sure.‚Äù He delivered on that promise, with Champions League, Premier League and Carabao Cup crowns added to the well-stocked trophy cabinet at Anfield. Just Klopp things. ‚úä pic.twitter.com/xTLgpJM8M1 Klopp announced he was leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023-24 season and he asked Reds supporters not to make every game about him by singing the song. That request echoed an earlier plea from Klopp not to sing the song too early in a game.  However, such is the admiration for the German coach among the Anfield faithful that they will no doubt feel compelled to serenade Klopp with every opportunity. Regardless of who replaces Klopp as Liverpool manager, his standing among the fans means that his song will continue to be sung long after his departure.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/jurgen-klopp-so-glad-chant-lyrics-meaning-liverpool-fans/blt25cd01a912087b57,Chris Burton,3e735fdf-f8e6-4561-bd36-51897097a18d
Ex-Arsenal star Ozil in talks to terminate Fenerbahce contract,"By Fatih Demireli - Mesut Ozil and Fenerbahce are in talks to terminate the playmaker's contract, GOAL and SPOX can confirm. Ozil is contracted to the Turkish side until 2024 but is set to be free to negotiate with other clubs. The Germany international joined the Super Lig team in January 2021 but has not lived up to expectation and was subsequently suspended by coach Ismail Kartal. Ozil will leave the club after just 36 appearances across a season and a half, having scored eight goals. Ozil's next move has not been decided as of yet as talks over a mutual separation with Fenerbahce are still ongoing.  However, it has been reported that he could stay in Turkey, with Basaksehir touted as a possible destination. The current Basaksehir coach, Emre Belozoglu, was sporting director at Fenerbahce when Ozil was signed by the Istanbul club in 2021. A move to MLS has also been listed as a possibility for the 33-year-old, as LAFC were said to be interested in signing him earlier this year. Ozil made the move to his dream club in 2021 from Arsenal, accepting a significant pay cut in the process. But things turned sour last season, starting with Ozil being left visibly outraged when he was substituted in a Europa League match against Royal Antwerp in October. Ozil was then dropped from the squad altogether earlier this year and suspended by coach Kartal. Despite the fallout, Ozil insisted he would stay at Fenerbahce until the end of his career and his hopes of getting back into the team were boosted when Jorge Jesus replaced Kartal at the helm. However, the Portuguese coach declared that the attacking midfielder would not be part of the squad. ""He had his time, his space,"" Jesus said at a press conference. ""He has a beautiful history in Turkey, nobody can take it away from him.¬† ""He is a well-known player around the world. But I will follow exactly what was the end of the Ozil era.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-arsenal-star-ozil-in-talks-to-terminate-fenerbahce/blt6e54249fa8a36d94,GOAL,d0c8c771-c723-4c9b-8c6e-fc5dc99bfb8d
'Gallagher can be a big asset' - Tuchel backs midfielder for breakthrough year at Chelsea,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has heaped praise on midfielder Conor Gallagher as the England international impressed in their pre-season friendly match against Club America on Sunday at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Chelsea won the game 2-1 against the Mexican club as Timo Werner and Mason Mount found the back of the net. The German coach spoke highly about Gallagher and suggested that it was a wise decision on the club‚Äôs part to send the player on loan to Crystal Palace last season which improved his standards. ‚ÄúConor trains at a really high level, and you can clearly see it was the right decision to let him go on loan,‚Äù said Tuchel after the friendly. ""He made a huge step in his development at Palace and became an England player. ‚ÄúIt was a very good start and a good match for him. Now it's important he gets used to our principles of the game, to understand when to move and when not to move, and his work rate is outstanding.

Ibrahimovic dedicates Serie A title win to Raiola and jokes about what his former agent's future advice would be,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a Serie A title winner with AC Milan at 40 years of age and has joked that Mino Raiola‚Äôs advice to him when it comes to big decisions on his future would be: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play another 10 years and steal more money!‚Äù The enigmatic Swedish striker has added more major silverware to his remarkable collection, with the Rossoneri bringing an 11-year wait for domestic supremacy to a close in 2021-22, but he is yet to sign a contract extension at San Siro. He no longer has a trusted confidant to lean on when it comes to thrashing out terms and making the right career call, with Raiola having died on April 30 at the age of 54, but the spirit of a larger-than-life agent lives on in one of his more high-profile clients. The vastly-experienced frontman returned to Italy in December 2019 following two years in MLS with the LA Galaxy and has hit 36 goals through 73 appearances. He told Sky Sport Italia on helping to inspire another title triumph in Milan: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful, I was here last time Milan won and 11 years later we win it and I‚Äôm here again. ‚ÄúI arrived here making a promise and I kept it. Many laughed when I said that we‚Äôd win the Scudetto again, but we worked hard and showed the team what it means to suffer for your results. ‚ÄúI dedicate this to Mino, he was one of those who wanted me at Milan and told me I was the only one who could save Milan. I dedicate this trophy to him.‚Äù Quizzed on what Raiola‚Äôs advice would be when it comes to contract discussions, Ibrahimovic added: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play another 10 years and steal more money!‚Äù Eleven years in the making üèÜ pic.twitter.com/bKsmSP3SWR Having helped to return Milan to the summit of Serie A, and with injuries starting to catch up with him, there have been suggestions that Ibrahimovic could head into retirement. He has offered no indication that will be the case, but concedes that he has much to mull over before deciding whether or not to prolong a distinguished career that has delivered major honours in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, France and England. Ibrahimovic said on making a decision on his future: ‚ÄúI need to be in good shape, I need to do things. When I feel good, then I‚Äôll see what the situation is. I still feel that I can make the difference when I‚Äôm on the pitch. I don‚Äôt see another Ibra out there. ‚ÄúI will make a decision over the next few days. I had a really tough time lately, it was bad both physically, but also for other personal matters.

'Dumornay is going to be one of the best players in the world' - How the NXGN 2022 winner is starring in France after leaving Haiti,"It was a bright summer‚Äôs day in north-western France, and almost 3,000 spectators were settling into their seats at the Stade de la Rabine for one of the final group stage matches of the 2018 Under-20 Women's World Cup, Germany vs Haiti. Among them was Amandine Miquel, head coach of Stade de Reims, and some members of her staff. Reims had a player, Helene Fercocq, competing in the tournament with France, and so the team had set up its pre-season training camp near the host cities. When the home nation was in action, the whole team would be in the stand supporting Fercocq, and when the staff had some time off, they would head out to other games, too. On this occasion, they were watching a Germany team touted for the title play against Haiti, debutantes at the tournament. The former, 3-2 winners in this match, were littered with stars already playing Frauen-Bundesliga football, but it was a Haitian player that made Miquel sit up and take notice. She was a commanding presence in the centre of midfield, despite being just four days away from her 15th birthday ‚Äì her age meaning she required special authorisation to even compete in the tournament. She was facing players older and with more top-level experience than her, but you couldn‚Äôt tell. ‚ÄúShe was way above the other players,‚Äù Miquel recalls to GOAL. ‚ÄúWe immediately knew we needed that player.‚Äù The player in question was Melchie Dumornay, the women's winner of NXGN 2022. It has been almost four years since that game and, as time has passed, the hype around Dumornay has only grown. That is understandable given the teenager flew back to France soon after the tournament to trial with seven-time European champions Lyon, and the club liked her - but could not sign her because of her age. The hype was building up to her 18th birthday in the summer of 2021, when she would finally get the chance to put pen to paper on a contract abroad and show what she can do on a regular basis at the highest level. At home in Haiti, that excitement was particularly big. Speaking to GOAL back in August, a few weeks before her destination could be revealed, Dumornay said, with a laugh: ‚ÄúMany people now are like, 'Oh my god, you're moving soon. So, who is it? Paris Saint-Germain or Lyon?'‚Äù Around 50 clubs wanted Dumornay. Clubs in Asia wanted her. Clubs in Europe wanted her. Clubs in the United States wanted her. ‚ÄúWe knew that the closer she got to being 18 years old, the more clubs would know what we already knew,‚Äù Miquel says. ‚ÄúWe knew we had to keep contact with Haiti and with the player to have a chance that she might choose us when she was 18.‚Äù In the end, Durmonay would indeed choose Reims, a club renowned for its ability to nurture and develop young talents while offering them the chance to compete in one of Europe‚Äôs top leagues. The midfielder knew that, but the club also had to make itself stand out from others that could offer similar. ‚ÄúI think what made the difference was that we didn't stop taking news from her, information from Haiti, I was even supposed to go and meet her and her family and other players in Haiti, but I couldn't because of the situation there in 2019,‚Äù Miguel explains. ‚ÄúWe were there all along and other clubs just came by at the last minute with bigger offers, obviously, but what we could offer to her in terms of time of playing, level of playing and also a team that is very close to her style - which is that we have a very young team with a lot of promising players that we try to get to their best level - [made the difference]. ‚ÄúShe knew she would be in a good championship, but she would still be an important player and not just a substitute.‚Äù What a goal by the 16 year old! üá≠üáπ Melchie Dumornay puts it in the back of the net with just two minutes into the second half. #CWOQ #WeBelong @fhfhaiti pic.twitter.com/OcLBse9ArK The club have not stopped putting that attention and care in since Dumornay arrived at the end of the summer, either. The signing of fellow Haiti international Kethna Louis, who has been playing in France for four years now, has helped her adapt to the ‚Äúsimple things‚Äù in particular. ‚ÄúHer integration was very fast and very, very positive,‚Äù Sonia Ouchene, another of Reims‚Äô rising talents who lives next-door to Durmonay, tells GOAL ‚ÄúShe's still a bit of a baby, she's barely 18, so she still has that childlike side, that fun side. She'll annoy everyone, hide, play jokes. I hope she will keep this spirit. She brings good humour and it's a pleasure to work with girls like her. I think she has brought us even more cohesion. ‚ÄúI got to know her very quickly. She's quite an open person. You might think she's a bit shy, but in fact she's not. She opened up very quickly, she became part of the group very quickly. She talked to everyone, she asked questions to everyone, she was really interested in our lives and our group life. ‚ÄúI didn't know Melchie at all before she signed for Reims. I had never heard of her. I started to hear about her when the signing was about to happen. That's when I saw some videos of her and I read about her a bit. I haven't forgotten her since!‚Äù It was October 2, 2021, when Durmonay made her debut for Reims. She had been available for the previous week‚Äôs game against Montpellier but, having missed pre-season, Miquel wanted to make sure she had enough training under her belt before getting on the pitch. She started the game against Issy on the bench. At half-time, the scores were level at 1-1 and the coach turned to her new signing. ‚ÄúI told her that she didn't need a full game to score and make good passes,‚Äù Miquel remembers. She was right. On 73 minutes, Dumornay lifted a long ball over the Issy defence for Kessya Bussy to run onto, and the winger made the pass into the assist it deserved to be with a thumping finish past the goalkeeper. 2-1. Ten minutes later, Dumornay burst down the left wing and drilled an inch-perfect cross along the ground to find Bussy again, unmarked at the back post, who tapped it home. 3-1. The win was secure. ‚ÄúWhen we saw that we said, 'Oh my God, imagine what she can do in a full game! If only in that short time, she can do so much good',‚Äù Miquel says. On her first start, the following week, she was even better. Against Bordeaux, who finished in the Women‚Äôs Champions League spots last season, behind only Lyon and PSG, Dumornay was the best player on the pitch, scoring twice and providing another assist for Bussy. ‚ÄúNow everyone's calling me, huh?‚Äù Miquel laughs. ‚ÄúTo get that player.‚Äù When most teenagers make such a big career move, to a foreign country no less, it usually takes them at least a little bit of time to adapt. Dumornay just has not needed that. Why? ‚ÄúBecause she's way better than the other players,‚Äù Miquel replies, quite simply. ‚ÄúI think she's at 30 per cent of her level right now. For me, this is going to be one of the best players in the world in the next few years. ‚ÄúShe's really far from her best level. She's going to continue to improve physically, technically and tactically. We'll do our best to get her through those steps and then she will sign to a big Champions League team and we will be very happy to watch her.‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm never surprised by players,‚Äù Ouchene adds. ‚ÄúThere are really very, very few things that amaze me, and she is one of them, especially because of her age. ‚ÄúAthletically, she is powerful and fast. In the game, she's very clever. Technically, she has everything you need, although, of course, she's going to improve in every aspect. ‚ÄúShe is a very complete player and she has shown it very quickly on the field.‚Äù üî•üò≥ Goal @fhfhaiti üá≠üáπ! Melchie Dumornay opens up the score with this magical free kick! Haiti now leads 1-0 over @miseleccionmx üá≤üáΩ. | #CU20W pic.twitter.com/kjUdBWN0Ol As was the case in the years before she signed for Reims, with Dumornay continuing to put in performances of this quality, her reputation and the interest in her will only grow. Reims and Miquel are well aware of that. ‚ÄúWe take a lot of time to watch the players from all over the world. Maybe the difference with other clubs is that we're not scared of taking risks,‚Äù she says, with there many young talents in the squad with the Haiti international. ‚ÄúWhen we feel that the player has something different, even if she's very young or if maybe she's small, or she has got weakness because she doesn't have enough muscle... Some clubs tell you she's too small, she doesn't have enough muscle, we don't do this. We feel talent. ‚ÄúIf we see a player that has talent, but some weakness, we know we will develop it and make a big player. ‚ÄúNow, I'm even sometimes refusing some players because I have all the parents, the agents of the best young players in France and in the world calling to come in our team, because they know that it's a very good experience for them and that we will take care of the players as if they were our own kids. It‚Äôs a global project, not just a football one. We develop the human being before the footballer. ‚ÄúWe know at some point, when they're 20 or 21, they will sign to a bigger club, but that's our aim right now, to help those young players be seen and progress in a team, maybe with less pressure than in a big team because we're more focused on the individual development than on the results.‚Äù When speaking to GOAL last summer, Dumornay described playing for Lyon as the ‚Äúabsolute dream‚Äù she was working towards ‚Äì but it is what she wants to do for her home nation if she is successful that speaks wonders of who she is, beyond the football pitch. ‚ÄúI want to be able to open an academy back home in Haiti to provide opportunities to players that I didn't have myself,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIn Haiti, there are so many talents, not only in soccer, that just don't get a chance. I got that chance to be in an academy, but there are top players and top talents everywhere. I hope that one day more people get the chance to get out of there.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe's very intelligent, very mature,‚Äù Miquel adds. ‚ÄúShe knows where she wants to go. She knows how to do it. She knew that she had to sign to a smaller club and not the big club straight away. I think she's dealing with her career with a lot of intelligence. ‚ÄúSome people have the qualities but will not make it. But she has the qualities and the intelligence to know what to do. That's why I'm pretty confident that she will make a very big career.‚Äù She may have only just began her professional career, but there are few doubts that Dumornay is on her way to the very top. What the future has in store for the NXGN 2022 winner is sure to be special.

'I still get flashbacks' - UN Refugee Agency ambassador Begovic opens up on fleeing war-torn Yugoslavia,"In a sporting sense, Everton are a club in crisis, with the Premier League side facing relegation from the English top flight for the first time since 1951. Asmir Begovic is acutely aware of the significance of the situation. However, as someone forced to flee war-torn Yugoslavia during his childhood, the 34-year-old goalkeeper also has a real sense of perspective. ""It was a difficult time for my family and I think the more I grew up, the more I think about it differently because the first time we were refugees, I was only four years of age,"" he explains in an exclusive interview with GOAL. ""With the pandemic and not a lot going on, I have had small glimpses in my brain, when something comes up, and I remember the travelling and the boats, and just trying to get to a safer environment. ""I get flashbacks every once in a while travelling in the car, too, not so much of when we had to leave Yugoslavia, but when we later had to leave Germany for Canada. That was difficult. ""We didn't have stability because we were on yearly visas and it was proving impossible to get renewed because our income wasn't enough. ""I remember that a lot more and, obviously, the impact that had on my family. These sorts of situations create a sense of unrest but also resilience and a sense of gratefulness for what you have today, which is a good life. ""It drives you to always do better and gives me a sense of fear of not ever wanting to go back."" Begovic, who was born in Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina, freely admits that even today he struggles to process exactly what he went through. However, there's one thing he's 100 per cent clear on: the incredible sacrifices his parents made to give him the best possible childhood. ""Looking back, it's a combination of things you feel, but I think the biggest thing is the respect for my parents ‚Äì that is huge. ""As you get older, you have responsibilities in life, and you become a parent yourself. But I could never imagine having to go through some of those situations now.¬† ""Nobody felt sorry for us and you couldn't feel sorry for yourself. My parents worked multiple jobs and my dad gave up playing football to work as a delivery driver. ""My mum was working in restaurants and as a cleaner, then studied to be a nurse while also learning a new language. ""We got through it; my parents made huge sacrifices. When you're put in that situation, it is quite simple: you either stay or go. We left and they worked out everything as they went along.""¬† As a kid ""with a funny German accent"" and a low level of English, Begovic initially found it difficult to settle in Canada. ""Luckily,"" he says, ""I was good at football and that helped me integrate. Of course, when you're younger, you don't overthink these things; you just kind of crack on."" Having continued to excel at football, making a name for himself as a promising young goalkeeper, Begovic eventually returned to Europe to join Portsmouth. However, because he was on a student visa, he couldn't play competitive fixtures. ""When I turned 18, I had to move to Belgium while paperwork was being sorted out,"" he explains. ""And it was to a club I never even heard of ‚Äì La Louviere. It was also a club in crisis.¬† ""Thankfully, Harry Redknapp came in [as manager of the Portsmouth senior side] and saw something in me. From there, you go to play against great Premier League clubs and play against great players, getting you into the national team.¬† ""And it really was good for me going into the Bosnian national team because a lot of the guys were from refugee families like me, and maybe more German or French because of it.¬† ""For me, it was like flirting with being Bosnian again after settling in the UK. I say it in my academies now: the biggest trait you need to make it as a footballer is resilience."" Begovic's story is certainly proof of that. Despite all of the difficulties he and his family went through, this is a footballer with over 450 professional appearances to his name. Fittingly, he is also now an ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency and it pains him to see the human cost of conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""This role brings back difficult memories,"" he admits. ""No one likes to see people being displaced by wars. It is absolutely awful.  ""These wars are just for people's egos. They are fighting over something that wasn't theirs in the first place.¬† ""Nothing good will come of it, it is just suffering and people losing things or, worse, loved ones. ""I try to do what I can to give money to the UN, an unbelievable organisation, or by raising awareness and helping people live their dreams. ""I'd say to people to just be open-minded. These people would rather be getting on with their normal lives and now their lives have been turned upside down. ""Be open-minded, compassionate and helpful as possible. Overall, our society is okay but in these moments we can always do more."" Despite his commendable commitment to addressing the refugee crisis, Begovic also remains intent on doing what he can to help Everton beat the drop. ""I have been blessed to play football for a living and I want to do it as long as I can,"" he says. ""It has obviously been a difficult season for many different reasons. It is just about surviving and kicking on next season.¬† ""We have got a great manager and staff who have achieved everything in the game you could imagine. I knew some of them from my Chelsea days. ""They are resilient people and we won't give up and stop fighting. We're trying our best and want to make the best of a difficult situation."" Just as Begovic has been doing his whole life.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/un-refugee-agency-abmassador-begovic-fleeing-war-torn/blt405be020720cc794,Nizaar Kinsella,f768b8b4-6a2e-476c-970d-b4dccb84b482
Brighton troll Man Utd with viral post-match tweet,"Brighton toasted their 2-1 victory over Manchester United on Sunday by trolling the Red Devils on social media.

"Villarreal 'know how to suffer' and will not be intimidated by Liverpool, insists Moreno","Villarreal will have an advantage when they face Liverpool in Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, says former Reds defender Alberto Moreno, because they know how ""to suffer"" against bigger opposition in the long game. The Yellow Submarine have turned last season's Europa League triumph in a remarkable run to the last four this term, knocking out both Juventus and Bayern Munich to set up a clash with Jurgen Klopp's Reds. Despite their success however, they enter as major underdogs - but Moreno believes they can thrive under the pressure as they know how to play when the going gets tough. ""Suffer,"" Moreno stated when asked how the Yellow Submarine would perform. ""We are going to suffer. But if you want to win against these teams you have to suffer. You're not going to beat one of these teams face-to-face, it's impossible. ""You have to suffer and we know how to suffer. Villarreal has a virtue, that we all know how to suffer together as a team, but then we also know how to play ball because there are players in this squad of spectacular quality. ""That explains the way we are doing. Because when we have to suffer against big teams, we suffer. And we know how to do it. And then with the ball the big teams suffer against us. They are aware of that."" Villarreal head to Merseyside in the first leg looking to mount a surprise advantage away from home soil, and Moreno adds that he considers the ground more hostile to visit than Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu - but says the Yellow Submarine have an advantage. ""For me personally, yes,"" he stated. ""I don't want any conflict or anything! But many of Villarreal's players have already played at Anfield and they know what it's like.

The signing is not yet complete, with formalities still to be carried out ‚Äì but the playmaker is now set to become one of a host of new recruits this summer. Eriksen became a free agent after his short-term deal with Brentford came to an end last month. Tottenham had also shown interest in re-signing their former player ‚Äì but when Antonio Conte turned his attention to other targets, it left United as front-runners for the 30-year-old. The news is a welcome boost to Ten Hag, who is dealing with the fall-out of Cristiano Ronaldo making clear his intention to leave the club. Ronaldo did not show up for his first day of pre-season training on Monday, citing family issues as the reason for his absence. United have accepted his explanation ‚Äì but are adamant he is not for sale and he will be expected to see out the remaining 12 months of his contract. Christian Eriksen has verbally agreed a three-year deal with Manchester United üó£ pic.twitter.com/qXvWdJQSTv As reported by GOAL, Ten Hag told United he wanted to sign Eriksen and top target, Frenkie de Jong, as part of a midfield overhaul. That is the area he considers most in need of address since taking over at the club, with Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard all leaving at the end of last season. Ten Hag sees Eriksen as capable of playing in a deeper midfield role or as a No10 to give him more options in the middle of the pitch. United‚Äôs priority is central midfield, with Ten Hag closing in on a deal for De Jong, but defensive reinforcements are also being sought at Old Trafford. Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia was due to complete his medical on Monday ahead of becoming the first signing of the summer, while a bid has also been made for Ajax centre-back Lisandro Martinez.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/christian-eriksen-agrees-to-manchester-united-transfer/blt798fb6155c0de8ce,James Robson,ce5da853-2bf5-44f5-aa1f-b3e128718bae
Barcelona have 'closed two signings' amid Christensen & Kessie transfer links as Laporta reveals Traore swap deal hope,"Barcelona have ""closed two signings"" amid transfer links with Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie, according to Joan Laporta, who has also revealed that he hopes a swap deal for on-loan Wolves winger Adama Traore can be arranged. Christensen is fast approaching the final few months of his contract at Chelsea, who are not currently in a position to offer him fresh terms after seeing the assets of club owner Roman Abramovich frozen amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. AC Milan midfielder Kessie is also set to become a free agent this summer, and Barca president Laporta has now hinted that they have already tied up deals for both players. The Liga giants have been scouring the market for free agents as they seek to reinforce their squad without having to fork out huge transfer fees, and it has been reported that Christensen and Kessie have both agreed terms at Camp Nou. When quizzed on the reports, Laporta told RAC 1: ""We have closed two players who end their contracts.  ""One is a midfielder, the other one is a centre-back. But I'm not allowed to mention their names."" The Barca chief also expressed his delight over how well Traore has settled in since his loan move from Wolves in January. The 26-year-old has recorded four assists in his first 10 appearances for the Blaugrana, helping them progress to the Europa League quarter-finals and close the gap on Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Barca remain short on funds as they continue to recover from a financial crisis, but Laporta has suggested that Traore could be signed permanently in a swap deal involving Francisco Trincao, who is currently on loan at Wolves. He said: ‚ÄúI think a swap deal with Wolves between Francisco Trincao and Adama Traore could be a very good option. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really happy with Adama and his impact, attitude, performances.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-closed-two-signings-christensen-kessie-transfer/blta32ac9af72e5f364,James Westwood,6ecee5f2-a90e-486a-a3e4-8475163122b3
Afcon 2021: Choupo-Moting 'felt disrespected' by Cameroon coach Conceicao,"Bayern Munich forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has come out to explain why he felt Cameroon coach Toni Conceicao had disrespected him during their Africa Cup of Nations third-place play-off fixture against Burkina Faso on Saturday. The 32-year-old played for the Indomitable Lions in the first four games at the 33rd edition of the tournament but he was not used during the quarter-final and semi-final matches. He missed the last eight fixture against the Gambia as Cameroon won 2-0 and he was also an unused sub as the Indomitable Lions suffered a 3-1 penalty defeat against Egypt in the last four to miss out on the final. Ahead of the third-place fixture against the Stallions, Choupo-Moting was listed as among the players to start in the game at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium but when the line ups came out, his name was missing. ‚ÄúEspecially what happened in the quarter-final and semi-final when the coach didn‚Äôt count on me for me it was a kind of disrespect,‚Äù Choupo-Moting, who has also played for French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain, said after the game as quoted by BBC Sport Africa. ‚ÄúI came here to help the team to win the Afcon I am not a young 18-year-old player and I want to play and to give everything. At the end of the day I respect every decision from the coach you have to as he is the boss but you don't have to understand it - so I don't understand. ‚ÄúThis is the reason I told him I was not fit to play today [Saturday]. But I will always be happy to represent Cameroon. It was just difficult.‚Äù During the Burkinabe game, the Indomitable Lions came back from three goals down to win 5-3 on penalties and clinch the bronze medal after a 3-3 stalemate in regular time. Speaking after the game, coach Conceicao explained why he reshuffled his squad against the Stallions. ‚Äú48 hours after playing extra time, I couldn't take any risks with the players and that's why I reshuffled my team,‚Äù Concei√ßao told the media as quoted by CafOnline. ‚ÄúWe saw several players play tonight and I'm satisfied with the performance of several players. ‚ÄúWe have a first objective which was to play the final but it was decided on details in the semi-final against Egypt. Today [Saturday] we demonstrated the strength of character of this group and we won on penalties.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-i-felt-disrespected-by-cameroon-coach-conceicao/blt025b5179bbe310d0,Dennis Mabuka,610a8258-6f64-4b05-af2a-f73128a0fefe
Crystal Palace hopeful of striking deal to take Gallagher from Chelsea again,"Crystal Palace ""would love"" to take Conor Gallagher from Chelsea again this summer, club chairman Steve Parish has admitted. Gallagher joined Palace on a season-long loan in July 2021, and has since played a key role in the club's push for a top 10 Premier League finish under Patrick Vieira. The 22-year-old has recorded eight goals and five assists in 36 games across all competitions for the Eagles, but is due back at Chelsea at the end of the season. No option to buy was included in the loan deal for Gallagher, who is still under contract at Chelsea until 2025, and Parish says a final decision on his future will be made by the Blues. The Palace chief is still holding out hope that the midfielder's services can be secured for next season, though, as he has told reporters: ‚ÄúConor‚Äôs future and that decision lies not with us but with him and Chelsea. They're the people that have to decide. ‚ÄúOnce they decide what their choice is, they know where we are and what we want. We're not going to pretend any different but we've got to respect them as a football club because he's their player. ‚ÄúAt the end of the season he goes back to Chelsea and they'll make their decision. Based on that, we'll be there and if everybody thinks it's the right thing for him to come back then we would love it. ‚ÄúIf it doesn't work out, we wish him all the best as well.‚Äù Even if the Eagles are unable to keep hold of Gallagher, Parish still has high hopes for the future and says they have other targets in mind to improve the squad. Palace's end goal is to emulate unfancied 2015-16 title winners Leicester and start challenging for silverware, as their chairman added: ‚ÄúObviously with Conor, we've got to see what we can do there. He's going back and we've got to either replace him or see if we can get him back. ‚ÄúWe've got one or two other situations that are well-documented so keeping what we've got here is an important thing. Then we've got one or two ideas of where we think we can add to make a difference, give ourselves something different, get even better at keeping the ball and be a bit more damaging when we've got it. ‚ÄúThere's no limit to our ambition at the football club. We'll obviously look to bring some of the youngsters through that we've got who are very good and we start every year dreaming of being Leicester.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/crystal-palace-hopeful-deal-gallagher-chelsea/blt57c3e79d3718fe2d,James Westwood,24dd4b09-5894-4bb6-85d2-e5b242b42a3b
Afcon 2021: Malawi 'must stand together' - Orlando Pirates' Mhango ahead of Morocco duel,"Orlando Pirates striker Gabadinho Mhango has called on his Malawi teammates to show team spirit¬†ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 duel against Morocco on Tuesday. Mhango has been a key figure for the Flames in Cameroon as he scored a brace against¬†Zimbabwe in their¬†second group game. The Bucs' forward insists Malawi must remain united as they are on the verge of making history in Cameroon. ""I think it‚Äôs a great feeling for everyone as a team and for the supporters as well in Malawi. Everyone is happy for us to be in the Round of 16,"" Mhango told iDiski Times. ""I think this is a time that I think we need to stand as a team, to be united, and the way the game is going now, we meet the big guns, with the big boys. ""So, now we just need to stand together to fight, and then, for me as well, I think we do it as a team together."" On his part, vice-captain John Banda described the game against Morocco as an encounter of their¬†lives. ""The Morocco game is the biggest game of our lives and we are looking forward to it,"" Banda said. ""We respect Morocco but don‚Äôt fear them. We played them twice in the Afcon three years ago, and I played in both matches. They are a beatable side with a proper game¬†plan."" Meanwhile, this will be the first meeting between Morocco and Malawi in Afcon, with the Atlas Lions having only lost one of their last 11 games when facing an opponent in the competition for the first time. The Flames will contest their first game in the knockout stage of the continental competition, in what will be their 10th game in the competition overall. They have only won two of the previous nine (D2 L5), but are unbeaten in two games coming into this one (W1 D1). The Cosafa nation had the lowest possession average of any team during the group stage of the ongoing Afcon edition (31.5%).

Watch: Neymar & Messi booed by PSG fans as Mbappe is cheered following Champions League meltdown vs Real Madrid,"Neymar and Lionel Messi were both booed by Paris Saint-Germain supporters while Kylian Mbappe was cheered in the trio's first appearance since the team's Champions League meltdown against Real Madrid. All three men played the full 90 minutes of PSG's 3-1 loss at Real Madrid, which saw them exit the Champions League 3-2 on agregate. Mbappe scored in both legs of the tie and has thusly escaped the wrath of the Parc des Princes faithful, but Neymar and Messi were both jeered whenever they touched the ball during the early stages of their latest Ligue 1 outing against Bordeaux. The boos were initally heard when Neymar and Messi's names were announced as both sets of players lined up before kick-off, and continued throughout the first 30 minutes.

Why is Messi wearing No.10 for PSG vs Nice? French shirt number tradition explained,"Paris Saint-Germain take on Nice in the last-16 of the French Cup, and you may be wondering why Lionel Messi hasn't been given the No.30 shirt ‚Äì and will instead wear his old iconic No.10 shirt, the number he favoured during his time playing for Barcelona. GOAL has what you need to know about why Messi is wearing the shirt usually occupied by Neymar and more. Messi is wearing the No. 10 for PSG against Nice because of a French Cup tradition which maintains that in the last 16 stage, the 11 starting players must wear numbers from 1 to 11. In the team news announcement posted by PSG in the lead-up to the match, the No.10 was assigned to Messi. The Argentine currently wears the No.30 shirt for PSG, due to Neymar occupying the No.10. Usually, of course, players are allowed to wear numbers higher than the number 11. Neymar¬†will not be featuring in the game against Nice as he is currently recovering from a left ankle sprain with ligament damage sustained in a Ligue 1 match against Saint-Etienne back in November. Tonight‚Äôs starting 1‚É£1‚É£ for the Nice game!  üèÜ #CDF | #PSGOGCN pic.twitter.com/YWH8R6b4nv And so, because Neymar will not be playing against Nice, the No.10 shirt has been temporarily vacated for Messi to wear in tonight's French Cup match only. The fact that Messi has history with the No.10 shirt playing for the Blaugrana only adds to the special nature of tonight's occasion. Assuming that PSG progress to the next round of the French Cup and Neymar returns to fitness, it is assumed that the Brazilian will reclaim his No.10 shirt ‚Äì¬†meaning that Messi will have to borrow another shirt number once again, at least temporarily, should both feature in the game. PSG's No.1 to No.10 shirts are all occupied, so Messi (assuming he plays in the next game) will have to swap shirt numbers again. Messi will forever be one of Barcelona's most iconic No.10s, his legend status at the club synonymous with his shirt number.  The Argentine began his first-team career at Barcelona and scored his first senior goal for the club¬†wearing the No.30, before switching to No.19 after establishing himself as a regular in the side. He inherited the No. 10 shirt from¬†former team-mate Ronaldinho, and the shirt holds a huge amount of weight in and of itself, usually reserved for the central¬†playmakers¬†of the team. Messi has spoken about the influence Ronaldinho has had on his career, especially with guiding him on transitioning into the senior side. ‚ÄúHe [Ronaldinho] was a great help,‚Äù Messi¬†told¬†the Barcelona official website in 2013. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never easy to go into a changing room at the age of 16, especially with my character. ""Before leaving the club [Ronaldinho] was coming off a few months where he was thinking about things. ""He had it in his mind that he was leaving and he told me to have his number. I took it without looking at what he had done with the shirt. If I did, I would not have taken it."" Messi took the No.30 shirt after signing for PSG as a tribute to the first shirt number he wore for Barcelona.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-is-messi-wearing-no-10-for-psg-vs-nice-french-shirt/blt3fdbaec9b0f3e420,Cady Siregar,06822ab7-9e5c-4491-b5c5-a0d5406d8af6

When is the Champions League final? Liverpool vs Real Madrid follows thrilling Lyon vs Barcelona match,"After last weekend's absorbing UEFA Women's Champions League final between Barcelona and Lyon in Turin, now it's time for the men's main event in Paris.¬† Liverpool will take on Real Madrid in a repeat of the 2018 Champions League final, which was marred by Mohamed Salah's early injury but illuminated by the Gareth Bale wonder-goal that sealed a third consecutive triumph for los Blancos, and a 13th overall. The Reds have every reason to be confident of gaining revenge for that 3-1 loss in Kyiv, given they have won every single away game on the road to Paris. But one can never, ever write off Madrid, who have pulled off one miraculous comeback after another on one of the most thrilling runs to the final the Champions League has ever seen. Drama, then, is guaranteed Drama in this clash between two of the European game's traditional super-powers.¬† Liverpool's eagerly-awaited rematch with Madrid will kick off on Saturday, May 28 at 2000 BST/1500 ET. The game will be broadcast by BT Sport in the United Kingdom, while American viewers will be able to follow the action on CBS, in English, and Univision, in Spanish. The Champions League final will be staged at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris. The 80,000-seater arena has staged two previous tournament deciders: Madrid's 3-0 rout of Valencia in an all-Spanish affair in 2000; and Barcelona's 2-1 victory over Arsenal in 2006. However, it is worth noting that the last time Liverpool met Madrid in a European Cup final in Paris, in 1981 at the Parc des Princes, the Merseysiders' triumphed 1-0 thanks to Alan Kennedy's late goal. Madrid are the most successful side in Champions League history, having conquered the continent on 13 occasions.¬† They are also bidding for what would be a fifth title in the past eight years and can still call upon many of the players that helped them win three in a row between 2016 and 2018, including Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, Casemiro, Dani Carvajal and, of course, Karim Benzema. Bale, Marcelo, Lucas Vazquez and Nacho are also likely to be on the bench. It was the introduction of Bale which turned the 2018 final against Liverpool, with the Welshman netting a spectacular overhead kick less than two minutes after coming on to put Madrid 2-1 up before sealing victory with a speculative shot from distance that Loris Karius spilled. However, the Reds have improved exponentially since that painful night and it is they who are bookmakers' favourites to prevail in Paris.¬† Liverpool put their 2018 defeat behind them as quickly as possible by returning to the final 12 months later to clinch their sixth European Cup with a 2-0 defeat of Tottenham. The following year, they ended their 30-year English title drought by winning the Premier League by a whopping 17 points from second-placed Manchester City. Injuries to key players such as Virgil van Dijk derailed their 2020-21 campaign ‚Äì during which they were knocked out of the Champions League 3-1 on aggregate by Madrid. However, having made a couple of shrewd signings in Ibrahima Konate and Luis Diaz, Liverpool now boast what Jurgen Klopp has admitted is his strongest ever squad. Salah admitted before the second leg of Madrid's semi-final with City that he wanted to play the Spanish side in Saint Denis and then, after the fixture had been confirmed, he tweeted: ""We have a score to settle."" The Egyptian's declaration drew criticism from some quarters, on the grounds that it might serve as added motivation for Madrid, but his preference was understandable. After all, Salah was forced off just half an hour into the 2019 final with a shoulder injury sustained after a controversial tangle with former Madrid captain Sergio Ramos. Klopp was in no doubt that the centre-half had deliberately wrapped up Salah's arm and dragged him to the ground, accusing Ramos of acting ""like a wrestler"". ‚ÄúRamos said a lot of things afterwards that I didn‚Äôt like,‚Äù the Reds boss told reporters. ‚ÄúAs a person, I didn‚Äôt like his reaction. He was like: ‚ÄòWhatever, what do they want? It‚Äôs normal.‚Äô No, it is not normal.‚Äù Ramos has always maintained that he did nothing wrong. At the time, he posted on social media: ‚ÄúSometimes football shows you its good side and others the bad. Above all we are fellow pros. Get well soon, Salah. The future awaits you.‚Äù As for Salah himself, he stated: ‚ÄúIt was a very tough night, but I‚Äôm a fighter."" And now he will get another chance to go toe to toe with Madrid in a Champions League final. Salah, of course, will also be hoping to advance his Ballon d'Or cause by lighting up the final and he's certainly one of the leading contenders, given the role he's played in Liverpool's fantastic season. However, many believe that this year's trophy will go to either Sadio Mane or Benzema, given the integral roles they've played in their respective teams' runs to the Champions League final. Benzema, of course, is the tournament's leading goalscorer, with 15 goals in just 11 games. The Frenchman has been on fire in the knockout stage, netting in five consecutive matches, a brilliant run of form that has featured hat-tricks against both Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. 2022 belongs to Karim Benzema. pic.twitter.com/S4hctHGXpm However, Mane has been decisive for Liverpool, scoring in both legs of their semi-final win over Villarreal. It's also worth remembering that the Senegalese superstar also fired his country to a first Africa Cup of Nations triumph earlier this year, with Mane netting the decisive penalty in the shootout success over Egypt. The winger then repeated the feat in Senegal's World Cup qualifying play-off with the same side, which is why some believe Champions League glory would result in Mane becoming just the second African after George Weah to win the Ballon d'Or. Lyon re-established themselves as the dominant force in women's football with a stunning 3-1 victory over Barcelona in Turin.  A number of the French side's players had admitted beforehand that they had been irked by the suggestion that their Catalan rivals had re-invented the game while winning a treble last season, and they certainly seemed keen to prove a point. Indeed, Lyon raced into a 3-0 lead inside 33 minutes, with Amandine Henry, Ada Hegerberg and Catarina Macario all on target. Barcelona captain pulled one back for Barca shortly before the break, with a strike that saw the Blaugranes captain finish the tournament as top scorer with 11 goals, but there was to be no dramatic second-half turnaround. Consequently, Lyon cemented their status as arguably the greatest dynasty in Champions League history by lifting the trophy for an eighth time in just 11 years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-final-liverpool-real-madrid/blt88cf79472b8cbcf2,Mark Doyle,99852949-03e0-43d4-922f-379a13626773
Emery: Villarreal's respect for Bayern Munich must be enormous in second leg of Champions League quarter-final,"Villarreal coach Unai Emery has warned his team to show ""enormous"" respect to Bayern Munich when they meet in their Champions League semi-final tie this week. Villarreal beat the German giants 1-0 in the first-leg in Spain last week and travel to Munich to conclude the tie on Tuesday. But Emery has warned that his team cannot underestimate Julian Nagelsmann's side and admits that the clash will be the most difficult of his coaching career. ""Respect for Bayern must be enormous in every way. It will be very difficult and we must know how to respond,"" he told reporters. ""It will be complicated, we know that they are accustomed to scoring a lot of goals at home and that's normal. ""They have respect for us, but they know that if they play at a high level they're favourites and they score goals. They're optimistic and they feel strong at home. ""Naturally in the sense of difficulty [this is the biggest match of my career], but I'm convinced of competing against a team favourited to beat us. ""I'm trying to help the players to do their best, knowing that it is very complicated. Knowing the importance, and to show them the team is capable of facing teams of this level. ""It will be a very different game from [the quarter-final against] Juventus and because it's away from home, it will be more complicated. ""We must hold them in defence and be dangerous in attack. But I expect a different game from the one at home."" Whoever wins the last-eight tie between Villarreal and Bayern will go on to face either Liverpool or Benfica in the next round.

He was contracted to Serie A champions Inter at that time, but regulations in Italy regarding player welfare prevented him from rejoining the fold at San Siro. The Nerazzurri agreed to the termination of his contract, allowing the ex-Tottenham star to spend time training with former clubs Odense and Ajax. A return to the ranks of competitive football was then presented to him by Premier League side Brentford, who have a fellow Dane at the helm in the form of Thomas Frank. Eriksen has been eased into the Bees fold, making an emotional comeback appearance against Newcastle on February 26, 2022 as he saw 38 minutes of action off the bench. A first start for new employers was made in a clash with Norwich on March 5, while 90 minutes have also been taken in against Burnley. Eriksen has done enough to convince Denmark boss Kasper Hjulmand that he should be returned to international ranks, and he could now line up against Netherlands and Serbia in upcoming friendlies. Eriksen only signed a six-month contract when linking up with Brentford, as both sides of that agreement sought to avoid committing to anything too long-term during a period of ongoing uncertainty. The talented midfielder has looked at home back on a Premier League stage, helping the relegation-threatened Bees to six precious points across his three outings so far. Should Eriksen continue to impress, while helping to preserve top-flight status in west London, then there is the option within his current terms to trigger an extension through to the summer of 2023.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/eriksen-denmark-squad-first-time-since-cardiac-arrest-euro/blta73824fe1d534beb,Chris Burton,f824871b-a7eb-4bce-bd86-c343d45d05e1
‚ÄòPower of Suarez and intelligence of Cavani‚Äô ‚Äì Liverpool new boy Nunez given big billing by former coach,"Liverpool have a ¬£64 million ($79m) deal in place for Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, with the Reds informed by the Uruguayan‚Äôs former coach they are acquiring a Luis Suarez-Edinson Cavani hybrid in the 22-year-old. The Reds have fended off rival interest in the South American from arch-rivals Manchester United as questions continue to be asked of how long Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah will be around at Anfield as they enter the final 12 months of their contracts. Now the man who handed a hot prospect his senior debut at Penarol is suggesting another Uruguayan sensation can emulate the efforts of illustrious countrymen. Leonardo Ramos, who handed Nunez his bow at 18 years of age, told La Pagina of a frontman following in Suarez‚Äôs footsteps in linking up with Liverpool: ‚ÄúHe has a similar style to Cavani, but it seems to me that Darwin is faster and more powerful. ‚ÄúHe is much more explosive and apart from that explosiveness he obviously showed incredible goal scoring ability. He has two parts, he is half and half between Suarez and Cavani. ‚ÄúHe has the power that Suarez had to go for it all, to go to the clash and fight with the rival. He also has the part of Cavani, of being a much more athletic player, more physical, more intelligent. ‚ÄúI think he is a combination of those two things.‚Äù The way Darwin Nunez had Liverpool dancing üï∫ pic.twitter.com/QTNlTm3Wla The deal Liverpool have put in place for Nunez could be worth as much as ¬£85 million ($104m), with various add-ons included.

Suarez made his own move to Liverpool in January 2011 and went on to register 82 goals for the Reds in 133 appearances.

Watch: Eriksen hit with coin during post-match interview following goalscoring Denmark return,"Christian Eriksen was hit with a coin during his post-match interview following a goalscoring return to international duty with Denmark on Saturday. Eriksen came off the bench to a standing ovation in the 52nd minute of Denmark's friendly clash with the Netherlands at Johan Cruyff Arena, and marked his first appearance for his country since suffering cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 with a goal. Denmark ultimately lost the match 4-2, but the Brentford midfielder expressed his delight at reaching another personal target after the game - until he was interrupted by a flying object thrown from the stands. Eriksen was asked by a reporter if supporters can now start to look forward to him playing at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, to which he initially replied ""well there are a few more games before"" and then lost his train of thought after being hit on the arm with a coin.

Juventus complete ‚Ç¨16m signing of Filip Kostic as West Ham miss out on Eintracht Frankfurt star,"Juventus have completed the permanent signing of Eintracht Frankfurt winger Filip Kostic. The 29-year-old attracted attention from clubs across the continent with his performances in the Europa League last season. Frankfurt won the competition after a final victory over Rangers, 42 years on from their historic UEFA Cup triumph, with Kostic providing three goals and four assists during their run to glory. West Ham looked set to win the race for the Serbia international at one stage, but he has now chosen Juve as his next destination, bringing to an end his four-year stint at the Waldstadion. Kostic has made the switch from Frankfurt to Juve for a reported fee of ‚Ç¨16 million (¬£14m/$17m) including add-ons. It is said that he will pocket around ‚Ç¨2.5m in annual wages during his time in Turin.

He will remain a Juve player through to at least the end of their 2025-26 campaign. Juve have moved for Kostic in order to bolster their options on the left, with the Serbian capable of operating as a wing-back or a more traditional winger. Kostic recorded 33 goals and 64 assists in 172 games for Frankfurt, and Allegri will hope that he can produce the same kind of form in the final third for the Italian giants. With the acquisition of Kostic, Juve are up to six signings so far in the summer transfer window as he joins the likes of Paul Pogba, Angel Di Maria and Bremer in making the switch to the Allianz Stadium. There are no hard feelings here, as manager Oliver Glasner called him a ""hero"" when confirming the sale. ""He's leaving Eintracht as a European Cup winner,"" Glasner said.

Rabiot's mother blasts critics for trying to 'destroy' Juventus midfielder,"Adrien Rabiot's mother Veronique has blasted critics for trying to ""destroy' the Juventus star, insisting he ""has nothing to prove"". Rabiot joined Juventus on a free transfer in the summer of 2019 after leaving Paris Saint-Germain. The Frenchman has struggled to live up to his big billing at Allianz Stadium, but his mother believes he does not deserve such criticism. Veronique, who is also Rabiot's agent, has come out to defend her son and offer an insight into the ""sacrifices"" he's made throughout his career. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where the negative image that the media has of us comes from, they destroy us all the time,‚Äù she told Ouest-France. ‚ÄúAdrien has nothing to prove, he plays football and it is his passion on and off the pitch. ‚ÄúWhen he‚Äôs not playing, he‚Äôd like to have a decent life and not spend time justifying himself.

Canada & Liverpool keeper Foster focused on full recovery after horrific car accident left her fearing she would never play football again,"Canada and Liverpool women's goalkeeper Rylee Foster says she is focused on making a full recovery after being involved in a horrific car accident that left her fearing she would never play football again. Foster was in a road traffic accident while away visiting friends in Finland during the November international break and suffered a number of injuries, including seven fractures to her neck. The 23-year-old was subsequently fitted with a special halo device to keep her neck mobilised and initially worried that her career may have to come to a premature end, but her prognosis is looking far more positive after a recent scan. Doctors have confirmed that Foster's fractures are knitting together naturally with the help of the halo, which she will soon be able to remove if her recovery continues to run smoothly. The Canada youth international has been present at Liverpool's recent games to cheer on her team-mates and is optimistic of joining them back on the pitch in the future after a serious health scare.

Moffi scores as Mbappe and Neymar propel PSG past Lorient,"Terem Moffi scored Lorient‚Äôs only goal as the Merlucciidaes were brushed aside 5-1 by Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday‚Äôs Ligue 1 fixture. The Nigeria international was on target in the second half, however, that could not stop them from crumbling against the Parisians. Still fresh from their 3-0 defeat to AS Monaco before the international break, Mauricio Pochettino‚Äôs team welcomed the Merlucciidaes to Paris - aiming to bounce back to winning ways. They made that intention known as early as the 12th minute with Neymar firing past goalkeeper Matthieu Dreyer thanks to an assist from Kylian Mbappe. Mbappe doubled PSG‚Äôs advantage in the 28th minute as he curled Idrissa Gueye‚Äôs assist home. For Lorient, they could not muster any shot on target as they were comfortable holding back to keep the scoreline respectable.¬† Nevertheless, Christophe Pelissier‚Äôs team stepped up their game in the second half to reduce the deficit through Moffi six minutes before the hour mark. The Nigerian took advantage of Achraf Hakimi‚Äôs poor square pass to Marquinhos before stabbing the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma - who was slow to react. Having in mind that the visitors could level matters, the hosts woke from their slumber to increase their lead through Mbappe, who skipped past a defender before finding the bottom corner of Dreyer. In the 73rd minute, the Frenchman turned provider to Argentian superstar Lionel Messi who scored for the first time in eight league outings. Neymar completed his double in the 90th minute as PSG sealed a comfortable win while former Real Madrid centre-back Sergio Ramos was booed with every touch of the ball by the home fans.

Man Utd hostile takeover plan confirmed by ex-director Michael Knighton as he insists the Glazers' 'time is up',"Michael Knighton has claimed that he is planning a ""hostile takeover"" of Manchester United, amid further fan protests against the Glazer family. Knighton came close to buying the club back in 1989 for just ¬£10 million, and famously showed off his football skills in front of the Stretford End prior to the deal being signed.  That takeover eventually fell through, but he did hold a seat on the Old Trafford directors' board for a time, and over 30 years later the businessman claims he is ready to mount a fresh offer for the Red Devils.  Fan pressure for the Glazers to sell does not show any signs of abating, with the latest demonstration resulting in the club's megastore being closed down prior to their 2022-23 Premier League opener against Brighton - which they lost 2-1.  ""We are a club in crisis and we all know the reason why,"" Knighton told Man Utd The Religion. ""We have an inept and frankly useless ownership who know little about this game of football. Everyone knows that we need new ownership of this football club and that is my aim and those are my objectives.  ""I am making good progress, continuing to talk to the people, I have got some good pledges and good finance. We are now working on the offer document. Remember, it is a hostile bid - that simply means that the club isn't officially for sale. Man United fans‚Äô Glazer protest forces closure of Megastore ahead of their first game of the season at Old Trafford pic.twitter.com/vUIGlNfKGC ""But my intention is to present these owners with a legitimate, potent and commercial offer to say: 'You have run out of road, it's time go, because your time is up'. ""And frankly, the fans worldwide have had enough of this regime. The exciting feeling of a new season, which we all have, and that balloon of excitement that is there, it was all burst when we quickly saw the performance against Brighton. The club is in crisis and it will remain in crisis while we have this current ownership."" The Glazer family very rarely give interviews, much to the frustration of the United faithful. Fans did get an insight into the feeling at the club earlier in the summer, though, as chief executive Richard Arnold highlighted the owners' willingness to invest in the squad in recent seasons during a debate with aggrieved supporters at a pub. Despite the mounting pressure to end their involvement with the club, there is little indication that the Glazers are looking to sell. Following United's opening-day defeat to Brighton, Sky Sports pundit and club legend Gary Neville called for the current owners to entertain a takeover bid. ""The time has come for the Glazer family to sell the football club. It's now,"" he said.

Football came home! Wiegman and England's Lionesses win the Women's Euros and become immortal at Wembley,"‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt fear anyone.‚Äù Those were the words of England head coach Sarina Wiegman ahead of the Women‚Äôs Euros final, as her team prepared to come up against its old foe, the team it had lost to on so many occasions ‚Äì Germany. There are several reasons why that is the genuine truth about the Lionesses and not just some empty words. The investment in the game in England, the growth and development of it, has been massive. The exposure to the highest level and the fact they‚Äôve been so many top teams is another factor. But among the biggest reasons has been the woman who uttered those words herself ‚Äì Wiegman, the coach that, on Sunday evening, led England‚Äôs women‚Äôs team to its first ever major title. She‚Äôs now coached this side 20 times since she took over. She‚Äôs yet to taste defeat. The old saying is that Germany always win. Often, that is true. They‚Äôve won the Women‚Äôs Euros eight times, the World Cup twice and clubs representing the nation have won nine Women‚Äôs Champions League titles ‚Äì more than any other country. But on this occasion, they were on the losing side of a final, Chloe Kelly stabbing the ball into the back of the net after an extra time goalmouth scramble in front of a raucous but nervous Wembley crowd ‚Äì the attendance of 87,192 a new record for the competition. That it was Kelly who scores the goal was fitting in a way. The Manchester City winger has been one of Wiegman‚Äôs ‚Äòsuper subs‚Äô throughout the summer, the Dutchwoman becoming the first coach in history to name an unchanged team for every single game in a Women‚Äôs Euros despite numerous calls for her to make changes. That‚Äôs because of how effective those players off the bench, like Kelly, have been. Ella Toone scored England‚Äôs first goal on Sunday, a lovely finish lifted over the onrushing Merle Frohms that initially gave the hosts the lead. She has been outstanding this summer ‚Äì as has Alessia Russo, the go-to sub for starting No.9 Ellen White scoring twice as many goals as her team-mate in the tournament. But this is what Wiegman did in 2017, when she won the Euros with the Netherlands. This is what she did in 2019, when she reached the World Cup final with her native country. It works and it worked again this time. That consistency and rhythm was crucial to this triumphant success ‚Äì but she wasn‚Äôt brought in by the Football Association because she plays the same XI a lot. What Wiegman has brought to this team has made a difference ‚Äì it‚Äôs won them a major trophy. She‚Äôs calm. She‚Äôs composed. She gives the players belief but she doesn‚Äôt let the highs be too high. ‚ÄúSarina has been brilliant,‚Äù Jill Scott, the midfielder who became the first England player to play in two major tournament finals on Sunday, having featured in the 2009 Euros defeat to Germany, said earlier this week. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an incredible woman. She‚Äôs very logical. She doesn‚Äôt allow us to overthink and keeps everything to the task and keeps us focused. I don‚Äôt think she realises how good she is actually! ‚ÄúShe is so calm on the side and she knows what we need to do to win. She is the driving force behind the reasons the team is in the final.‚Äù England needed all of that this summer. The hysteria around the team has been incredible. The support of the nation beyond anything these players have experienced before. They‚Äôd never been in this moment. Scott was the only one to play in a Euros final, but even that was a world away from this. It was at Wembley. It was a sold-out crowd. It was huge. Yet, in the build-up to this game, there was such a relaxed feeling. ‚ÄúNone of us have been in this position before,‚Äù Leah Williamson, the England captain, said before the game. ‚ÄúThe opportunity I've had for growth in this tournament has given me confidence. I think I'll be ready for whatever emotions come my way tomorrow."" At full-time, she was in tears ‚Äì as were so many of her team-mates. They made history. They did it on the biggest stage, amid the highest pressure. They changed women‚Äôs football forever this summer off the pitch, but they also became immortal on it. They brought football home.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/football-came-home-wiegman-and-england-s-lionesses-win-the-women-/blt03e1306009078090,Ame√© Ruszkai,8d176797-6144-47f6-b071-8dd99e3f2061

"Messi is the GOAT but Ronaldo is 100% the man for the big occasions, says Man Utd-linked Rice","Declan Rice has seen a move to Manchester United speculated on, which could allow him to work alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, and the West Ham midfielder says the Portuguese superstar is the player he would turn to for inspiration on ‚Äúbig occasions‚Äù. The five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner has proven himself to be the most reliable of options for United, Real Madrid and Juventus, with a remarkable goalscoring record seeing him break countless records down the years. Rice is a big fan and admits that a man still going strong with the Red Devils at 36 years of age would be his selection to step up and take a nerve-shredding penalty that had plenty riding on it. England international Rice told Gary Neville on ‚ÄòThe Overlap‚Äô when asked who he would pick to stand over a decisive spot-kick: ‚ÄúGoing to have to say Ronaldo - 100 per cent Ronaldo. ‚ÄúThe penalties he's scored in big moments, Champions League finals, tournaments. I'd 100% put my money on CR7 for the big occasions.‚Äù Ronaldo‚Äôs penalty record is more than useful having converted 143 efforts from 12 yards in his career to date, while missing only 28. His eternal rival Lionel Messi has failed with 29 of the spot-kicks he has taken, while scoring with 103 for club and country, and the mercurial Argentine is another player that Rice holds in the highest regard. In fact, the Hammers skipper considers the South American icon to be the finest talent to have ever played the game, with that statement difficult to argue against given all that a man with seven Ballon d'Or awards to his name has achieved. Rice said when asked for his take on the Ronaldo vs Messi debate: ‚ÄúYou know what, it is such a hard question because obviously what him and Cristiano Ronaldo have done is a freak of nature, nobody will ever do that ever again. ‚ÄúMessi, I just feel what he does with a football, he is just special, and I don‚Äôt think we will ever see a player like that ever again.‚Äù Rice will be hoping to grace the same Champions League stage as Messi and Ronaldo at some point in the near future, with there plenty of speculation to be found regarding his future.

When will Paul Pogba be back for Man Utd? Red Devils star's absence explained,"Manchester United's Paul Pogba has yet to feature under new manager Ralf Rangnick, after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed in late November. Pogba has been absent from the United squad since late 2021 ‚Äì so why has the Frenchman not been playing and when is he likely to return? GOAL takes a look. Pogba is not playing for Man Utd as he is currently recovering from a groin injury that he suffered on international duty with France back in November. He has been training in Dubai, taking advantage of the warmer weather conditions to get back to full fitness. Rangnick stated on January 18 that the Frenchman is likely to be available after the next international break.

Is Elon Musk buying Manchester United? SpaceX mogul clarifies tweet on potential Old Trafford takeover,"SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has clarified a tweet he sent to his followers on social media indicating that he wants to buy Manchester United. United supporters' discontent with the Glazer family's ownership has reached new heights in recent times, with the Red Devils enduring another disappointing transfer window. They are no closer to signing long-term target Frenkie de Jong, while they have also been linked with Marko Arnautovic and Adrien Rabiot - two deals which were hugely unpopular with fans. On the pitch, things have been equally disastrous, with United crashing to a 2-1 defeat to Brighton and losing 4-0 against Brentford in their opening two Premier League games. Musk got United fans very excited with an interesting Twitter outburst on Wednesday. After providing another update on his political leanings, the Tesla CEO followed up by tweeting: ""Also, I'm buying Manchester United ur welcome."" When asked by a user if he was being serious, Musk clarified his position. He added: ""No, this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I'm not buying any sports team. Although, if it were a team, it would be Man U. They were my fav team as a kid."" Although, if it were any team, it would be Man U. They were my fav team as a kid.

Everyone knows that we need new ownership of this football club and that is my aim and those are my objectives,"" he said. ""I am making good progress, continuing to talk to the people, I have got some good pledges and good finance. We are now working on the offer document.

"Champions League all-time top scorers - Ronaldo, Messi & UCL goal kings","The Champions League has featured some of the best goalscorers in history. As the premier club competition in Europe and arguably the world, it is a stage that has been graced by countless icons of football. Striking sensations such as Raul and Andriy Shevchenko dominated during the 1990s and 2000s, while Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have taken the art of scoring to a whole new level. This page contains affiliate links. When you subscribe through the links provided, we may earn a commission. GOAL takes a look at the all-time top scorers in the competition's history, dating back to the inaugural European Cup in 1955. As you can see from our table below, Cristiano Ronaldo is the top scorer in the history of the Champions League (including the European Cup). He¬†is closely followed by his arch-rival,¬†Lionel Messi. There is a significant gulf between that pair and the rest, Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski following in third. Karim Benzema follows in fourth, while Raul completes¬†the top five, with the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Thomas Muller and Thierry Henry among the best of the rest. Rank Player Goals Appearances 1 Cristiano Ronaldo 140 183 2 Lionel Messi 129 162 3 Robert Lewandowski 91 111 4 Karim Benzema 90 150 5 Raul 71 142 6 Ruud van Nistelrooy 56 73 7 Thomas Muller 53 139 8 Thierry Henry 50 112 9 Alfredo Di Stefano 49 58 =10 Andriy Shevchenko 48 100 =10 Zlatan Ibrahimovic 48 124 12 Eusebio 46 65 =12 Filippo Inzaghi 46 81 14 Mohamed Salah 44 79 =14 Didier Drogba 44 92 16 Neymar 43 81 17 Alessandro Del Piero 42 89 18 Sergio Aguero 41 79 19 Kylian Mbappe 40 60 20 Ferenc Puskas 36 41 21 Erling Haaland 34 25 *Correct as of games played on April 20th, 2023**The list takes into consideration data from 1955-present***Players in bold are still active The composition of the all-time¬†goalscorers list is mostly made up of players who are playing or played in the modern Champions League era (i.e. 1992 onwards) which has added more continental games to the modern day calendar.¬†Specifically, of the 20 players in the list above, 17 of them played from the mid 1990s on. However, despite that,¬†two players who played in the pre-Champions League era (when the tournament was known as the European Cup)¬†still figure prominently, with former Real Madrid star Alfredo Di Stefano and Benfica icon Eusebio featuring in and around the top 10. Ferenc Puskas , who shone for Real Madrid in the 1950s and 1960s, is¬†also in the top 20. Former Bayern Munich striker Gerd Muller was in the top 20 before being edged out by Mohamed Salah. Despite being nudged out, no player comes remotely close to Gerd Muller's phenomenal goals-per-game ratio of 0.95. Puskas boasted a goal-to-game ratio of 0.85 and Di Stefano's was 0.84, while Messi's is currently 0.8, which is undoubtedly the best in the modern era.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/champions-league-all-time-top-scorers-ronaldo-messi-ucl-goal/bb6oc60xwhwz1955ojuru3l00,GOAL,b3949c18-042e-4d1f-a0c7-b871f159105e

With @wilfriedzaha replacing Jean-Philippe Mateta vs Southampton, the Ivorian has made his 274th appearance in the EPL.

The lanky striker accrued that number during a spell that saw him represent Arsenal, West Bromwich Albion and Portsmouth during his 13-year stay in England. Even at that laudable feat, Kolo Toure and Shola Ameobi remain the only Africans to have played more games in the competition. While former Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City defender Toure accrued 353 caps, Newcastle United icon Ameobi occupies the second spot with 298 matches under his belt. Should Zaha remain in the Premier League in the 2022-23 campaign, he is expected to eclipse Toure‚Äôs mark which he achieved during his spells at Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool.

""He [Zaha] has been linked after the [Arsenal] game?! There is no truth about that,"" the Frenchman was quoted by Metro. ""I believe Wilfried [Zaha] is an important player for the team, for the football club, he is a really good inspiration for the young players that we have.

West Ham manager Moyes attacks Champions League reform proposals for favouring Premier League 'Big Six',"West Ham manager David Moyes attacked the latest proposals for Champions League reform after seeing his side rise to sixth in the Premier League with a 2-1 win against Everton. The current version of the Champions League consists of 32 teams, but it has been reported that UEFA are considering adding two more from 2024. It has been proposed that the extra two places will be awarded on the basis of coefficients with the winners of the FA Cup potentially being given the opportunity to qualify, but Moyes is against any changes that might threaten the tournament's ""inclusive"" model. The Hammers boss feels league finish is still the only fair way for teams to qualify for Europe's elite competition. ""We talk about being inclusive in football, that means to give all the teams the opportunity to get there,"" Moyes said after his side's latest Premier League victory. ""If a smaller side won it, we'd expect to be treated the same way. Maybe if I was at a top-six regular, would I want that? I don't think most people see that as the correct format to go. It should be on merit."" West Ham moved into the top six after beating Everton, and Europa League qualification is once again within the Hammers' grasp. They could even steal a place in the Champions League by winning their remaining games as they now sit just three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, albeit having played a game more. Moyes was happy with the final result against Everton but played down the possibility of a top-four finish, telling reporters: ""It could have been a bit cleaner at times but at this stage of the season you're happy to get the points. ""Being back in the European bracket shows in the main we have had a good season, and we have to keep it up.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/west-ham-moyes-champions-league-reform-premier-league-big/bltff4b5908a00fa8c4,James Westwood,3de412c5-9a84-48bb-a038-690aea70bd76
Dele Alli misses open goal from one yard as Everton thrashed 4-0 by MLS side Minnesota United in friendly,"A point-blank miss from Dele Alli perfectly summed up the day for Everton as they were hammered 4-0 by Minnesota United in the final game of their United States tour.  The England international had a gaping goal in front of him without the keeper, and yet he somehow failed to poke the ball into the net. Frank Lampard will have a lot to ponder as his side looked toothless against the MLS outfit and they suffered their second loss within a span of four days.  The midfielder got the best opportunity of the night for the Blues after Mason Holgate drilled in a low cross inside the six-yard box across the face of the goal.  The Minnesota defence were caught wrong-footed and even the keeper could not stop the cross from reaching Dele despite getting a hand to it.  I think Dele Alli will want this chance back. pic.twitter.com/aePr1rVsf6 Video credit: Bally Sports Lampard used 23 members of his squad in the friendly but three first half goals from Emanuel Reynoso, Kemar Lawrence and Luis Amarilla sealed the match. The hosts got their fourth ten minutes from the final whistle through Abu Danladi making the most of a sloppy Everton defence.  After a disappointing pre-season tour in the United States, the Toffees will head back to England where they have a couple of more friendlies lined up. On July 24, they will get an opportunity to get back to form when they take on Blackpool at Bloomfield Road. On July 29, they will host Dynamo Kyiv at Goodison Park which will be their last friendly before they face Chelsea in their Premier League opener on August 6.

From Neymar to Mbappe - Top players who rejected Real Madrid,"When Real Madrid come calling, invariably the player in question tends to make the move. There are not too many players who would have the heart to say no to the Spanish giants given their trophy-laden history and legacy. From David Beckham to Luis Figo, they have snapped up the biggest stars of football for astronomical prices. A few have their dreams fulfilled while many fail to make the cut. There are several examples where even after joining Madrid, they could not prove their worth and had to leave. However, there are some legends of the game who have turned down the offer to Real Madrid. While Kylian Mbappe's decision not to join Real Madrid must have been a hard one to take for Real Madrid fans, especially given the 2017 incident. One must note that the French international had already turned them down once back in 2017 when he was with Monaco. Steven Gerrard rejected Madrid in 2004 and did so again in 2010.

"PSG vs Brest: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain aim to get back to winning ways on Saturday night when they welcome Brest to the Parc des Princes. Mauricio Pochettino's men have drawn four of their last five league matches and face a Brest team who have been in strong form on the road, with three wins and two draws in their last five away games. The side from the French capital have won 11 of their last 12 home league clashes and PSG can be backed at 1/5 (1.20) with bet365 to pick up three more points. Brest for their part are priced at 10/1 (11.00) to record their fourth away win of the season while the draw is offered at 13/2 (7.50). Lionel Messi will miss the game as he recovers from coronavirus, with Kylian Mbappe the favourite to open the scoring at 5/2 (3.50). Mauro Icardi meanwhile can be backed at 10/3 (4.33) while Brest's top scorer is Romain Favre with seven goals and the 23-year-old is priced at 25/1 (26.00) to break the deadlock in Paris. The Parisians may be running away with the Ligue 1 title but their recent results have not been overly impressive. Defensively, PSG have been less solid than they would like and their record of two clean sheets in their last nine league matches underlines just how regularly their opponents have been able to cause them problems. Brest, meanwhile, boast a superb scoring record on the road, having netted in all 10 away matches they have contested in the French top flight this season, and the visitors will be confident of being able to at the very least get on the score sheet. The most recent meeting between the sides saw Brest net twice in a 4-2 defeat and backing goals at both ends once again this weekend should appeal. Both teams to score is priced at 4/5 (1.80) and looks like an excellent option while combining this selection with over 2.5 goals sees the odds rise to evens (2.00).

'Sarr's quality important for relegation-threatened Watford' - Hodgson,"Watford manager Roy Hodgson is confident his winger Ismaila Sarr will play a vital role in helping the team get a positive outcome against Liverpool in the Premier League. On Tuesday, the Senegal international scored to help the Lions of Teranga win the penalty shootout 3-1 against Egypt to seal a place in the 2022 World Cup after an aggregate 1-1 score. With the Hornets fighting relegation, Hodgson believes the quality of Sarr might impact his teammates positively. ""It‚Äôs great when [players] go away, and come back fit, but it‚Äôs even better when they come back like Sarr, celebrating that his team has now qualified for the World Cup..."" Hodgson said ahead of the Saturday game. ""[Sarr‚Äôs] been recovering today. His chances of being involved are okay, as long as he shows us [on Friday] that he‚Äôs recovered from 120 minutes, and both games. ""It has been a hard journey for him playing for Senegal, but a very successful one, so that‚Äôs buoyed his spirits I‚Äôm sure. ""I am pretty certain he‚Äôll put his hand up tomorrow to be asked to come into the starting line-up, and as far as I am concerned, a player of his quality will be very important for the club if we are going to pull ourselves away from the relegation zone because you can‚Äôt do it without players of that quality."" The tactician has been impressed with the way players are fighting for their positions, including Nigeria international Emmanuel Dennis. ""I think the competition for places has become hotter, '' Hodgson continued.  ""I was happy with [Craig] Cathcart, I was happy with Tom Cleverley, and Dennis, Sarr and [Joshua] King, but the other players that have come in have made me think.  ""That‚Äôs good going forward. We need to keep these players fit, keep the competition going, but most important of all this club needs spirit! ""If Watford survive this year, it will be partly because the players have shown themselves to be good enough, but it will be because the spirit is good, and they‚Äôve really wanted it."" Watford are in the 18th position with 22 points after playing 29 games.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sarr-quality-important-for-relegation-threatened-watford/blt180a2bf6809aacbb,Seth Willis,135fdef0-23ea-4426-be69-c333fb17d32f
Aubameyang grabs ninth goal of the season as Barcelona see off Real Sociedad,"Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was on target as Barcelona snatched a 1-0 La Liga victory against a stubborn Real Sociedad at Reale Arena on Thursday night. The 32-yer-old scored the all-important goal in the 11th minute to help Barcelona move to second on the 20-team table with 63 points from 32 matches. Aubameyang, who moved to the Catalans giants in February, should have scored early on as he missed a clear chance after being put through by Ousmane Dembele. Dembele also had a chance to put Barcelona ahead in the ninth minute but his weak effort whizzed over the bar. However, it was the former Arsenal captain who put them ahead after his glancing header, following a pass from ex-Manchester City player Ferran Torres, and beat the outstretched hands of goalkeeper Alex Remiro. In the process, Aubameyang became Barcelona‚Äôs joint-top goalscorer this season with Memphis Depay on 11 goals in all competitions. The Gabon international has now netted in nine La Liga encounters as well as twice more in the Europa League. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has nine La Liga goals in 11 appearances üëç pic.twitter.com/5KdDdqXm52 The goal gave Barcelona some confidence and they continued to attack Sociedad, and it was Dembele who once again got another great chance to score the second, but his well-worked effort was stopped by Remiro. Aubameyang could have doubled the score in the 34th minute but after an inviting cross from Dani Alves, he opted to dribble instead of shooting and was cut out by Sociedad defender Joseba Zaldua. Sociedad‚Äôs first real chance of the game came in the 54th minute when Alexander Isak found himself unmarked inside Barcelona‚Äôs danger zone, but his final effort was easily dealt with by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who dived the right way to push it out for a fruitless corner. Aubameyang was later withdrawn for Luuk de Jong with nine minutes left to the final whistle. His goal also helped Barcelona to return to winning ways in the top-flight as they had lost 1-0 against Cadiz on Monday. A first league goal of the season for Aubameyang came against Valencia in a 4-1 victory on February 20, when he netted twice. In last season's Premier League, he played in 29 games for Arsenal, scored 10 goals, and provided three assists.

Man Utd close in on ¬£46.5m Lisandro Martinez transfer as De Jong remains top target,"Manchester United are closing in on the signing of Lisandro Martinez for ¬£46.5 million ($55m). Negotiations with Ajax are now at an advanced stage, with a deal expected to be agreed to make the centre-back Erik ten Hag's second signing of the summer. As revealed by GOAL, United moved into pole position for Martinez after rival bidders, Arsenal, stepped back in the belief the player favoured a move to Old Trafford. Ajax had been reluctant to sell ‚Äì rejecting earlier bids of around ¬£40m ($47m). But the Argentina international made it clear he wanted a move to the Premier League and be reunited with Ten Hag, who was his manager with the Dutch champions. United chief executive, Richard Arnold, and football director, John Murtough, stayed behind as the club flew out on their tour of Thailand and Australia last week in a bid to tie up their transfer business. They have been in Barcelona this week to step up negotiations for top target, Frenkie de Jong, with Martinez next on their list of priorities. Manchester United have made a formal offer to Ajax for Lisandro Martinez üìù pic.twitter.com/KY4mfc9nks United waited to formalise their interest in Martinez but were aware a fee of between ¬£45-50m would be enough to secure a deal after seeing lower bids from Arsenal rejected. The player‚Äôs determination to join up with Ten Hag has also been critical. United remain confident De Jong is prepared to move to Old Trafford, despite his public insistence that he wants to stay at Barcelona. A base fee of ¬£55m ($65m) has been agreed between the clubs, but issues surrounding back pay are standing in the way of a deal being completed.

'Salah played with injury in Champions League final' - Egypt's team doctor makes new revelation about Liverpool star,"Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has been struggling with injury for two months and played in the Champions League final despite his fitness issues, the Egypt national team doctor says. Salah sustained an injury in the first half of the Reds' FA Cup final win against Chelsea on May 14. He was subsequently left out of their next Premier League match and was limited to just 32 minutes in the last domestic game of the season against Wolves amid fears that he would not be able to play against Real Madrid in the European decider. Salah returned to play the full 90 minutes in the 1-0 loss in Paris and went on to captain Egypt in their African Cup of Nations qualifying match against Guinea earlier this month. Egypt team doctor Mohamed Abou El Ela has revealed that the 30-year-old was still struggling with his injury when he joined the national squad. He told On Time Sports: ""Salah's injury occurred¬†during the FA Cup final in the adductor muscles, then he played against Wolves and in the Champions League final, and all of this in just 14 days.  ""We read a statistic that he's the second highest player in terms of minutes played this season. ""We send and receive¬†players with medical reports, and Liverpool's said that he had pain and should get an x-ray, there's not a 100% fit player, but there's the question of whether he can push himself and play without risk. ""The club thought that one game is enough and we chose the Guinea game because the second against Ethiopia would be hard for him to travel in a long flight. He couldn't play another¬†game after three days."" Salah featured in 51 games for Liverpool in all competitions, starting 45 of those matches. He also made 15 appearances for Egypt, including the 1-0 win over Guinea on June 5. Seven of those matches for Egypt came at the African Cup of Nations, where he helped his country reach the final before they were beaten on penalties by Senegal. That's a grand total of 66 matches played in the 2021-22 campaign. The attacker has entered the final year of his contract at Liverpool and the club are determined to convince him to sign an extension. However, both parties have been unable to reach an agreement thus far, sparking reports that he could leave in the near future. Indeed, The Athletic reported that Salah - who has been linked with the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona - would prefer to stay in England if he left the Reds. Depite the rumours, Salah has confirmed that he will stay at Anfield for at least one more year, saying in May: ""I'm staying next season for sure. That‚Äôs clear. I‚Äôm staying next season. Let‚Äôs see after that.""

"Arsenal's young English core makes history as Nketiah, Saka and Smith Rowe shine in win at Chelsea","Arsenal's young core shone bright in a 4-2 win over Chelsea on Wednesday, with Eddie Nketiah, Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe making history while securing a result Saka called ""huge"". The trio, all aged 22 or younger, combined to score all four Arsenal goals. They are among the driving forces of the Gunners' pursuit of the top four, which remained very much alive with the victory at Stamford Bridge. Saka and Smith Rowe are the second and third Arsenal players aged 21 or younger to score at least 10 times in a Premier League season, joining Nicolas Anelka in that club. The Gunners are the third Premier League side to have multiple players aged 21 and younger reach double figures in the same season after Leeds in 1999-00 (Michael Bridges and Harry Kewell) and Manchester United in 2006-07 (Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo). Meanwhile, Nketiah enjoyed a return to the goalscoring department as he netted his first league goals in more than a year and his first brace in the top-flight. Each of Nketiah, Saka and Smith Rowe are English, which makes the team's young core particularly rare. It was the first time Arsenal named six Englishmen in their starting XI for a Premier League match since 2001 with the trio joining Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White and Rob Holding in the team.

Keep calm and carry on: Man City prove their mettle at Leeds to keep Liverpool at bay in title race,"Leeds United 0-4 Manchester City: Match Statistics Amid the chaos, Manchester City kept calm to keep their destiny in their own hands. At Elland Road on Saturday evening, Leeds United did everything they could to drag Pep Guardiola's side into a match of disarray and disorder; one that was just as crucial to their relegation battle as it was to City's Premier League title hopes. However, City know how to hold their nerve in high-pressure situations and, thanks to a 4-0 win which restored their one-point advantage over Liverpool at the top of the table, the English champions are now just four more victories away from retaining their title. Tuesday night's chaotic Champions League victory over Real Madrid was an extreme example of what can happen if you throw City out of their rhythm, with both sides exchanging punches like two heavyweight sluggers, and Guardiola is determined to stop it happening too often. Ruben Dias returned to the ground where he made his City debut in October 2020 and instantly pulled together a struggling defence ‚Äì and reprised the role here alongside Aymeric Laporte. City's centre-back pairing provided City with the platform for their success, shutting down a passionate but toothless Leeds side who didn't manage a shot on target until the 89th minute. Still, the hosts gave their all from start to finish, and there were undeniably moments in the first half when City looked upset by the home side's physical approach. Bernardo Silva quarrelled with the home side's bench, Guardiola and Jack Grealish exchanged views over a hacked clearance, and Joao Cancelo almost recreated Seven Gerrard's infamous slip that cost Liverpool the 2014 title, before Ilkay Gundogan sprinted back to save his embarrassment. Manchester City go back above Liverpool after beating Leeds 4-0 üîù pic.twitter.com/F2DPxgzUDY However, City were ultimately far too strong for their opponents, even though Guardiola rotated his squad ahead of the return to the Santiago Bernabeu, with Kevin De Bruyne and Silva missing as part of a calculated gamble. Raheem Sterling was recalled and danced through what looked like the floor of a school disco after Leeds fans covered the pitch with paper detritus, and he was unfortunate not to find the goal. On the other side, ¬£100 million Jack Grealish sparkled sporadically in between being targeted by the fans and Leeds players. Stuart Dallas, caught him late with one challenge, but came off worse and unfortunately left the pitch on a stretcher. Again, though, it was the magic of Phil Foden that was the biggest threat. A certain starter in the Spanish capital, he moved to a more central role and pulled the strings and pulled the Leeds defence apart. He claimed two assists, the first with a driven free-kick that Rodri simply had to touch in to put City ahead. His second, and City's third, showcased why the No.8 position will be his long-term role, as he drove at the Leeds defence and played a beautifully-weighted pass for Gabriel Jesus to score his sixth goal in three games. Guardiola's instant reaction was to take Foden off and wrap him up for the huge second leg in the Spanish capital on Wednesday. The pressure may be building, but City show no signs of imploding.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-prove-mettle-leeds-liverpool-title-race/blt99e0ed2b5f629890,Jonathan Smith,1855624c-1300-41d2-966b-53c6473963d3
Arsenal-linked Tielemans admits summer transfer away from Leicester 'not out of the question',"Youri Tielemans has not discounted the possibility of a transfer this summer, as Arsenal remain linked to the Leicester star. The Gunners, along with Tottenham, have been speculated to be in pursuit of the Belgium international, who has been an impressive figure for the Foxes since his arrival from Monaco in 2019. With the midfielder entering the final year of this deal under Brendan Rodgers, suggestions are rife that he may well be headed for pastures new - and now Tielemans has not ruled out the chance of an exit himself. ""That is not out of the question,"" Tielemans admitted when asked about the possibility of a move while on Belgium duty during the international break. ""I feel very good at Leicester, I was welcomed with open arms from day one. I'll give everything for the club until the last day. ""But of course you have to listen to other opportunities, you have to look at your career, and sometimes you have to make choices. Maybe one will come my way."" While the 25-year-old says he is settled at the King Power Stadium, his form has nevertheless attracted a share of admirers - and with European football off the table next season, Leicester may have to field some enterprising bids. Both Arsenal and Tottenham have been linked with a move for his services, with Mikel Arteta's side thought to have the edge in the race for any signature. But Antonio Conte's Spurs would be able to offer Tielemans the chance of playing Champions League football next term, in what could prove a persuasive dealbreaker.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-linked-tielemans-admits-summer-transfer-away-from/blt304ff6d3cb606aa9,Andrew Steel,52ff3ccf-0811-4636-93df-858f4b73565d
Dembele and Toko Ekambi propel Lyon past Wahi‚Äôs Montpellier,"Olympique Lyon outplayed Montpellier 5-2 in Saturday‚Äôs Ligue 1 fixture with Karl Toko Ekambi and Moussa Dembele finding the net. Having failed to win any of their last four league matches, La Paillade travelled to the Groupama Stadium aiming for redemption, however, they were hit for five in the seven-goal thriller. Still hurt by their 2-1 defeat against Brest, the Kids began the game on the right note as they went ahead courtesy of Dembele‚Äôs 26th-minute strike. The 25-year-old pounced on a rebound to drill an unstoppable shot past goalkeeper Jonas Omlin. That deficit was a reality check for the visitors who went close to restoring parity a few minutes later, but they paid for their profligacy in front of goal. With three minutes left to the half-time break, the home team doubled their advantage thanks to Thiago Mendes‚Äô sumptuous free-kick.¬† In the goal-laden first half, Sepe Wahi reduced the deficit for Olivier Dall'Oglio‚Äôs side after he was teed up by Teji Savanier. Before referee Francois Letexier signalled the end of the first half, Montpellier levelled matters through Savanier‚Äôs penalty following a handball by Jerome Boateng. Three minutes after the hour mark, Houssem Aouar helped the Kids regain their lead after profiting from Mendes‚Äô assist. Five minutes later, Toko Ekambi made it four goals to make up for his early miss - where his shot rattled the crossbar. The former Villarreal man has now scored 11 times in the French top-flight this term.¬† The Cameroonian turned provider for Aouar to give Peter Bosz‚Äôs side a comprehensive league triumph.

Austin FC 'Wolf of Wall Street' chant: Matthew McConaughey's classic humming song comes to MLS,"Hollywood superstar Matthew McConaughey has been bringing joy to football and film fans in Major League Soccer, by hyping up Austin FC supporters with a rendition of a chant from an iconic scene in The Wolf of Wall Street. The Austin chant is a homage to one of McConaughey's classic movie scenes in the 2013 Martin Scorsese film, which sees the actor discuss secrets of their trade with Leonardo Di Caprio's character. McConaughey has mentioned in the past that he is ‚Äúnot interested in just being a mascot‚Äù at Austin, but he has been enjoying these moments with the fans. GOAL brings you everything you need to know about the Austin FC 'Wolf of Wall Street' chant. Austin FC's 'Wolf of Wall Street' chant is a simple rhythmic chant based on an iconic scene between Di Caprio and McConaughey in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. You can watch the chant in the video below. Before it became a renowned chant (or hymn) thanks to the movie, McConaughey actually used it as a ""relaxation tool"" before his shoots. McConaughey only has one significant scene in The Wolf of Wall Street, but it turns out to be one of the more memorable moments of the movie. The scene itself saw McConaughey‚Äôs character (Mark Hanna), giving Di Caprio‚Äôs character (Jordan Belfort), a run-down of his stock broker firm and what it meant to be a successful stock broker during a lunch meeting. At the end of their meeting, McConaughey‚Äôs character begins to beat on his chest and hum the song, just like he did at the beginning of the meeting, except this time, he gets Di Caprio‚Äôs character involved. The pair used the chant almost to conclude the meeting and to psych one another up. However seven years after the release of the movie, McConaughey took to Twitter and revealed that the chant was never supposed to be a part of the scene. #McConaugheyTakesThe Wolf Of Wall Street@paramountpics @leodicaprio @jonahhill @margotrobbie pic.twitter.com/AN4NGkJSnH Di Caprio had noticed that before each take, McConaughey was chanting away to himself, to help him relax and prepare for the take. To which, Di Caprio had an inkling that the chant would work with his character, and asked McConaughey to perform the chant at the beginning of the scene. McConaughey agreed, but then threw everyone off when he also began chanting away at the end of the scene too, and so this ritual became a notorious chant through improvisation, and it was all shot in one take. McConaughey has spoken out about how his soccer-obsessed Brazilian wife helped him rekindle his relationship with the world‚Äôs most popular sport. The Oscar winning actor spoke to CNN about how he did play soccer as a child but lost touch with the sport because it wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúquintessential American game then‚Äù. Matthew McConaughey killing it on the bongo ü™òThat's it. That's the tweet.pic.twitter.com/U8GncZCK2G He then went on to describe his marriage as having ‚Äúsoccer injected into my blood‚Äù and thus he has grown a deep love for the sport, commenting that it is a great tool for peace and togetherness. ""Reykjavik, Cape Town, Cleveland, New York, Malibu, Warsaw. There's a soccer ball there,"" said McConaughey. ""You can go up to anyone. You do not have to introduce yourself or even say your name. Just put a foot out and the ball comes to you. It's the great peacemaker. I call the soccer ball the greatest invitation in the world.‚Äù His passion for the sport grew so big that in 2019 he bought a minority share of Austin FC, located in his home state. Austin FC fans are building their songbook and they even have another McConaughey-inspired track among them. Check out a few of them below. Alright‚Ä¶Alright, Alright, AlrightAustin!

McKenna leaves Man Utd to become new manager at Ipswich,"Kieran McKenna has left his role as first-team coach at Manchester United to become the new manager at Ipswich Town. McKenna kept his job at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last month but GOAL confirmed on Thursday that the 35-year-old coach was looking to leave and had held talks with an ambitious League One side.¬† United granted McKenna permission to spread his wings, with everyone at the club accepting it is a great opportunity for the Northern Irishman, and it has now been confirmed that he will succeed John McGreal at Portman Road.

""It feels like the right time, project and Club to make my first step into first-team management. ""For now, the focus for the team has to be on a huge game on Saturday. After that, I cannot wait to meet everyone and get to work."" He added in a farewell statement on United's official website: ¬†""It has been a great honour to work for Manchester United for the last five years.

"Manchester City vs Sporting: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Manchester City are all set to sail into the quarter-finals of the Champions League when they host Sporting CP in the second-leg of their last-16 tie on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola's team thrashed the Portuguese side 5-0 in Lisbon last month to all but confirm their spot in the next round. The Premier League leaders approach the match after a convincing win against Manchester United and will be looking to keep building momentum with another victory. Manchester City are the heavy favourites to win the match with odds of 1/9 (1.11) with bet365. Sporting, meanwhile, are serious underdogs at 20/1 (21.0) and the draw is offered at 9/1 (10.0). Riyad Mahrez is priced at 10/3 (4.33) to open the scoring in the match against Sporting, while team-mate Gabriel Jesus is available at 4/1 (5.0). Paulinho is the lowest-priced Sporting player to score first at 12/1 (13.0) while Pedro Goncalves is 14/1 (15.0). Manchester City have failed to win on just two occasions so far in 2022 and head into this game off the back of a fantastic 4-1 win against Manchester United. Pep Guardiola will not want his men to take their foot off the gas despite their incredible lead in the Champions League tie and will hope to send a message to their rivals by increasing it further. The coach almost has a full team to choose from, too, minus the injured Nathan Ake and Rubin Dias, and the suspended Kyle Walker.  Kevin De Bruyne is a slight doubt after picking up a knock against Manchester United. Sporting have been rather inconsistent in recent weeks, having drawn with Maritimo and lost to Porto. They did beat Arouca 2-0 ahead of this match, however. Matheus Nunes is suspended for this match, while Daniel Braganca, Pote and Joao Palhinha are all expected to be out due to injury. Manchester City are on a three-game winning run and expected to pick up another convincing victory against Sporting. You can back them with a -1 handicap at 4/9 (1.44), while over 2.5 goals is priced at 2/5 (1.4).

Ex-Manchester United man Neville admits he wanted Man City to beat Liverpool in Champions League final,"Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville has admitted he wanted Manchester City to beat Liverpool in the 2021-22 Champions League final. The Reds reached their 10th final after seeing off Villarreal in the last four at the start of the month, with Real Madrid now the only team left standing in their way of the trophy. City looked destined to reach the showpiece for a second successive year only to fall victim to a stunning comeback from Madrid in their semi-final tie, and Neville believes they have missed a golden opportunity. The Man Utd legend felt City had the tools to beat Liverpool in an all-English final, which he would have welcomed because of his fears over the Merseyside outfit adding to their haul of major silverware. Neville doesn't want the Reds moving too far ahead of his old club as the most successful side in English football, and said on his Sky Sports podcast: ‚ÄúI actually thought Manchester City could beat Liverpool in the final. ‚ÄúObviously they are the great rivals, and we cannot have them getting ahead in the Champions League or titles, to be honest with you.‚Äù Neville was speaking after Man City's 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday, which saw them move three points clear of Liverpool at the top of the table. The Reds slipped up against Tottenham to hand the reigning champions the initiative in this season's title race, but Ruben Dias suffered an injury during City's latest win to join Kyle Walker and John Stones on their list of absentees. Neville thinks Liverpool still have a chance of stealing the trophy due to that news, with Pep Guardiola's side now set to face tough examinations away at Wolves and West Ham. ""I do believe Wolves or West Ham could shock Manchester City,"" he said. ""With Ruben Dias injured, they are going to teams who have got systems of play that can hurt City. Both teams have had good seasons.  ""They are awkward. Man City will need to be at their best. The centre-back partnership has been obliterated. The injury is a boost for Liverpool's chances. I do think there is something left in this title race. It won't go plain sailing to the end.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-neville-man-city-liverpool-champions-league-final/blt17c701f703fec831,James Westwood,86fce9d5-0391-4293-9281-6e8c28f5128a
Why do Real Madrid wear white? La Liga giants' kit colour history explained,"Real Madrid are synonymous with their classic all-white home kit that they have worn for decades. This page contains affiliate links. When you subscribe through the links, we may earn a commission. Just as Barcelona are known for their signature blue-and-red striped shirts and nicknamed the 'Blaugrana', Real Madrid's iconic all-white get-up have them known as 'Los Blancos'. So why do Real Madrid wear all white? GOAL takes a look. Real Madrid's all-white get-up was actually inspired by London side Corinthians FC. While the all-white strip has been Real Madrid's trademark look throughout their long and decorated club history, there was one season where the Madrid side did not, in fact, have both their shirt and shorts be white. In 1925, former Real Madrid players Patricio Escobal and Felix Quesada were inspired by London's Corinthian FC side during their travels in England. Corinthian were known for their famous kits with black shorts, synonymous with their legacy for elegance and fair sportsmanship. In a view to emulate the Corinthians, Real Madrid introduced black shirts to their previous all-white get-up, but this change only lasted one year. The season they wore the black shirts, they were eliminated from the cup by Barcelona in a humiliating 5-1 loss in Madrid and a 2-0 defeat away. Former President Pedro Parages then stated that the club were to return to the all-white number, stating that any deviation to the norm would be a bad omen. Real Madrid have been playing in their traditional all-white kit ever since. Real Madrid are called ""Los Blancos"" because of their all-white kits. ""Blancos"" means ""whites"" in Spanish, so in Spanish, they are referred to as ""The Whites"".",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-do-real-madrid-wear-white-la-liga-giants-kit-colour/blt3bcff820367bc5f5,Cady Siregar,b8878484-f52d-4baf-a31f-44deccbfa18a
Senegal 2022 vs Senegal 2002: Whose achievement was greater?,"It‚Äôs been no secret during the course of the Africa Cup of Nations that this current Senegal team were walking in the footsteps of giants and living in the shadow of ghosts. 2022 marks the 20-year anniversary of the Teranga Lions‚Äô previous finest achievements in football, and the iconic team of 2002. 20 years ago, Senegal broke new ground in the Nations Cup when they reached their first final, and pushed an iconic Cameroon team close before falling on penalties. Later in the year, they would make history as Africa‚Äôs second team‚Äîand the first for 12 years‚Äîto reach the quarter-final of the World Cup. Like Cameroon in 1990 and Ghana in 2010, that campaign was full of iconic moments, and an argument could be made that the opening tournament victory over France‚Äîthe reigning European and world champions‚Äîwas the continent‚Äôs greatest ever achievement at the World Cup. It certainly rivals Cameroon vs Argentina in 1990, and I would argue surpasses that due to the perceived imperiousness of that France team when they entered the 2002 tournament. While Cameroon in 1990 were multi-time African champions and had already tasted World Cup competition, that was Senegal‚Äôs first ever appearance on the global stage‚Ä¶and they defeated the ‚Äô98 winners no less. There were some sublime moments during that campaign, from El-Hadji Diouf terrorising France‚Äôs ageing backline, to Papa Bouba Diop‚Äôs goal and subsequent dance.  There was the enthralling 3-3 draw with Uruguay, and the Salif Diao wondergoal against Denmark, while Henri Camara‚Äôs golden-goal winner against Sweden in the Last 16 finally ended Africa‚Äôs wait for another World Cup quarter-final appearance. That team enjoyed days of glory, but they also tasted failure as well, ultimately falling to Turkey‚Äôs Golden Goal winner in the quarter, and missing out on the African title earlier in the year. That last failure might not have hit so hard had Senegal made amends sooner and clinched their maiden African crown earlier, but in fact, they fell far from those heady heights in the next two decades. When Aliou Cisse took over in 2015, they‚Äôd fallen in the group stages of three of the five previous Afcon tournaments, while failing to qualify entirely in 2010 and 2012. After finishing fourth at the tournament in 2006, they would only win one Afcon match in the next 11 years before Cisse led them to the quarter-finals in 2015. Some could argue that he‚Äôs enjoyed the services of a talented generation, but Senegal had been blessed with the likes of Papiss Cisse, Demba Ba, Mohamed Diame, Mamadou Niang and Moussa Sow in the intervening years without being able to drag themselves out of the doldrums. After the 2017 tournament, Cisse took Senegal back to the World Cup in 2018, although, despite being pooled into a favourable group along with Japan, Colombia and Poland, they fell at the first hurdle after taking four points from their three matches.  Still, it was progress, and a terrific learning experience for a young team who held their own against tough opponents from three different continents. What followed was a run to the Nations Cup final in 2019, seeing off Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Benin and Tunisia, while losing both matches against Algeria‚Äîincluding, critically, to Baghdad Bounedjah‚Äôs early goal in the final. For Cisse, it completed a cruel double, losing the final as both a player and a head coach, although the loss did fuel his single-minded determination to end Senegal‚Äôs wait for the crown this time around. His achievements before the victory on Sunday have been impressive, driving the Lions on their way to success. Cisse has taken Senegal into the world‚Äôs top 20 in the Fifa World Rankings‚Äîhaving been 64th when he took over‚Äîwhile under him, they‚Äôve become the first team to reach back-to-back finals since Egypt in 2010. Mane‚Äôs penalty against the Pharaohs at the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe‚Äîto secure the crown‚Äîwas surely the greatest moment in the country‚Äôs footballing history, although overall, this Nations Cup campaign doesn‚Äôt have the iconic status for the Lions as their achievements in 2002. It‚Äôs more balanced, it has more star power, it has Mane, but it doesn‚Äôt quite have the character of Senegal in ‚Äô02, nor the unpredictable creative talents that made for such compelling viewing 20 years ago. Similarly, while 15 separate nations have won Nations Cup crowns across 33 separate editions of the tournament, only three have reached the last eight of the World Cup, and only two‚ÄîCameroon and Senegal‚Äîdefeated the reigning champions en route to the quarters. If the Teranga Lions can build on this success by qualifying for a second consecutive World Cup and, who knows, perhaps even emulate (or surpass?) the team of 2002, then they surely would‚Äîindisputably‚Äîbecome the country‚Äôs greatest ever side.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/senegal-2022-vs-senegal-2002-whose-achievement-was-greater/blt8c2f5315a50a2109,Ed Dove,40794e8d-6077-4a15-9dfc-9ee918c5d7e6
How adidas‚Äôs 2022 World Cup kits celebrate national identity,"adidas has unveiled its federation kits for the 2022 World Cup, revealing the away kits for Argentina and Mexico alongside both home and away designs for Germany, Japan and Spain. All of the kits mix two very different requirements, meeting the needs of the players wearing them and the fans at home. ‚ÄúEvery time we create a football jersey, we have two main priorities,‚Äù Mateo Kossmann, a senior product manager at adidas Global Football tells GOAL. ‚ÄúFirst is to celebrate the culture of a nation by creating a shared identity that allows players and fans to connect and unite under one idea. The second is to provide the best for the athlete and the player to perform, not only from a performance perspective but also doing it in a sustainable way.‚Äù All of the now unveiled kits are inspired by the countries that will be wearing them, whether that‚Äôs through cultural references or nods to their footballing history. This includes graphics taken from national crests or flags, as well as patterns that highlight the country‚Äôs history ‚Äì both on and off the field. Speaking about the kits, Kossmann draws attention to the Japanese home kit, which has been given an all-over pattern. ‚ÄúThe inspiration for the graphic on the kit is a three-legged origami crow, such as the crow in the crest of the federation,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIf you create 1000 origamis, you get a wish granted. The wish we have for Japan in this World Cup is to go further than ever before.‚Äù adidas hopes that the repetition of the crow, which makes up a pattern on the front and sleeves, is enough to get this wish granted. Other references that run throughout adidas‚Äô 2022 World Cup lineup include a graphic based on the Sol de Mayo from Argentina‚Äôs flag, an undulating pattern taken from Spain‚Äôs 1982 logo ‚Äì the last time it hosted the World Cup ‚Äì and an all-over pattern on the Mexico away shirt, which is inspired by the art of its ancient civilizations. For the German home kit, adidas have looked into the country‚Äôs footballing history to create a new design. The stand-out feature of the shirt is its large central stripe, which hosts a gold crest and adidas logo. ‚ÄúThe vertical bar on the front is a very familiar element for the German federation because it was used on the very first German national kit in 1908,‚Äù explains Lisa Datz, an adidas Global Football senior product manager who worked on the design of the new Germany kit. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve used that element already on some kits, including the away kits in 2008 and 2016. Here we just bought it even further to really capture the DNA and to bring the nation together.‚Äù As well as attempting to capture the spirit of each nation, adidas also ensured that their 2022 World Cup kits are also packed with their latest technologies to help players perform. This includes the use of lightweight heat-applied details and adidas‚Äô HEAT.RDY technology across the kits for all five federations. ‚ÄúThe technology used means perfect moisture management and breathability,‚Äù Datz continues. ‚ÄúWe want to make sure that our athletes can perform in the best way, using the best technology we have within adidas to make players feel comfortable and to keep them cool.‚Äù The commitment to performance capabilities is matched by adidas‚Äô commitment to sustainability, something that the brand announced was a priority for the 2022 World Cup. All of the kits are produced using 100% recycled polyester, while adidas has also upgraded its HEAT.RDY technology in line with its environmental focus. ‚ÄúFor the first time now the HEAT.RDY fabric is made using Parley Ocean Plastic, plastic that has been diverted from coastal towns and regions and prevented from going into the ocean,‚Äù says Andrew Dolan, senior product manager for apparel in adidas‚Äô Global Football team. ‚ÄúSo not only are these the best performing jerseys we‚Äôve ever had, but the most sustainable as well.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/adidas-2022-world-cup-kits-celebrate-national-identity/blt80575e3f73f401cf,Jack Stanley,5058e605-1aef-441d-9141-1a04dcf13243

Klopp backs Liverpool winger Luis Diaz to become consistent scorer like Salah & Mane,"Jurgen Klopp believes that Luis Diaz has the ""potential"" to match the goal-scoring exploits of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane at Anfield. Diaz joined the Reds from Porto in January, having attracted their attention by scoring 16 goals in 26 matches during the first half of the 2021-22 campaign.  Liverpool forked out an initial fee of ¬£37.5m (‚Ç¨45m/$50m) to bring in the 25-year-old and he made an instant impact to help Klopp's side win a League Cup and FA Cup double, but he has only managed to find the net six times in 28 outings to date. Diaz drew another blank in the Reds' season opening 2-2 draw with Fulham last week, but Klopp is confident the Colombian's numbers will improve as he continues to adapt to life on Merseyside. When asked if Diaz, who is expected to hold down a spot on the left wing following Mane's departure to Bayern Munich this summer, could score 15 goals or more in 2022-23, Klopp told reporters: ""Definitely, that is his quality. We need to see it but of course, that is his potential.‚Äù¬† The German manager added: ""We work on it but not with Luis specifically ‚Äì we don‚Äôt take him out because the other two scored [Salah and Darwin Nunez] and he didn‚Äôt so we show him how. That‚Äôs not necessary.  ""You can‚Äôt force it. People asked: ‚ÄòHow can you play without Sadio?‚Äô when in November/December everybody was thinking about when he would score the next goal. You just let it go."" Diaz was left frustrated against Fulham as he spurned two golden opportunities, while last season's Golden Boot winner Salah and summer signing Nunez were far more clinical, but Klopp remains unfazed. ""You see the situations he [D√≠az] had [at Fulham], big chances, and he was unlucky,"" he said. ""He is in a really good shape and that is more important.  ""It‚Äôs not that I tell him after a game, ‚ÄòYou should have scored here or there‚Äô. The boys know that in the moment. It happens. It‚Äôs a normal process.‚Äù Klopp took Mane under his wing after luring the Senegal international to Anfield from Southampton in 2016, and he managed to score 129 goals in 269 appearances for the Reds, while also setting up another 48 for his team-mates. The 55-year-old head coach believes Diaz can emulate Mane and flourish in his system for years to come, with a home clash against Crystal Palace up next on Monday night. ‚ÄúWhen Sadio played against us, he scored three times for Southampton but it was not that he scored every week. He didn't even start the game when he played against us,"" said Klopp. ""It is the way we play. It‚Äôs the way we bring the boys in the situation. They will be in a lot of goalscoring situations and that then makes you the player we remember. He just needs one goal and then we will go from there."" Next up, a return to Anfield üè°#LIVCRY pic.twitter.com/wygPZxCCai",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-backs-liverpool-winger-luis-diaz-become-consistent/blt91b2131dc57d51e8,Soham Mukherjee,82fa1d5a-deea-48e3-a6e0-82907798629e
What is St Totteringham's Day? Arsenal & Spurs top four Premier League taunt explained,"When it comes to the rivalry between Arsenal and Tottenham, it is fair to say that the Gunners have had more to shout about. With 13 league titles and 14¬†FA Cups, Arsenal's trophy cabinet requires a lot more polish than that of Spurs, who have eight FA Cup wins to their name and last won England's top prize in 1961. And, even though Spurs boast a greater number of continental trophies, Arsenal have been much more of a fixture in the likes of the Champions League and Europa League. Winning more trophies than Tottenham is not the only concern for Arsenal fans each season though. These days there is a day of celebration which does not even involve silverware.¬† It is called St Totteringham's Day. If you are not sure what that is, do not worry as GOAL brings you everything you need to know right here. St Totteringham's Day is the name given to the day on which it becomes mathematically impossible for Tottenham to finish above Arsenal in the Premier League. It is a time of celebration for Arsenal fans, who find themselves in a position to gloat about the superiority of their team as officially confirmed by the composition of the league table. The concept is believed to have been born in 2002, when it appeared on the Arsenal fan website 'Arseweb', but it did not become mainstream until 2010. Since then, St Totteringham's Day has been a common feature in discussions related to the north London derby. It might come as a disappointment to some to learn that there is no such saint as St Totteringham. The name of the unofficial 'holiday' is a portmanteau of Tottenham and the adjective 'tottering', which Merriam-Webster defines as ""being in an unstable condition"". Given the nature of the celebration, the date of St Totteringham's Day changes each year and (whisper it if you are an Arsenal fan) sometimes does not occur at all. When it does happen, the date tends to fall in March, April or May. You can see the breakdown of St Totteringham's Day dates going back to the 2010-11 season below. During the tenure of Arsene Wenger as Arsenal boss, it became something of an inevitability and Gunners fans were able to celebrate finishing ahead of Spurs for a remarkable uninterrupted period of 21 years. Gunners supporters even began singing a song created to bask in their dominance, known as 'It's Happened Again', which goes: ""It's happened again / It's happened again / Tottenham Hotspur, it's happened again."" However, the tide has been turning since the final years of Wenger's reign and Tottenham ensured that the holiday was cancelled in the 2016-17 season, doing so in emphatic fashion by beating the Gunners 2-0 at White Hart Lane. There was no St Totteringham's Day in 2017-18 either as Spurs finished third, a massive 14 points ahead of Arsenal, who ended the campaign in sixth place.  Nor was there a St Totteringham's Day in 2019-20 - when Spurs finished sixth, three points ahead of the Gunners. Indeed, it failed to happen again in 2020-21 and 2021-22. However, St Totteringham's Day returned in 2022-23 when Arsenal's title hope suffered a huge blow in a 3-3 draw against bottom side Southampton, but on the plus side it did mean Spurs can not now finish above the Gunners in the table. One of the most memorable St Totteringham's Days for Arsenal fans came in the 2015-16 season when Wenger's side leapfrogged Spurs on the final day of the campaign. Mauricio Pochettino's side needed only to avoid defeat against already-relegated Newcastle United in order to finish the season ahead of their rivals, but astonishingly lost 5-1 while the Gunners beat Aston Villa 4-0. The earliest St Totteringham's Day happened on March 9, 2008 when Arsenal completed the feat with nine games remaining. They actually did it with 10 games to spare during the year of The Invincibles, but the date itself was March 13, 2004 - four days later than in 2008. The 2012-13 season saw the latest ever St Totteringham's Day with the Gunners finishing ahead of Spurs in the final game of the season on May 19. There does not appear to be an accepted Tottenham equivalent to Arsenal's St Totteringham's Day, though Spurs fans undoubtedly take great pleasure in finishing above their fiercest rivals in the league. When Tottenham 'cancelled' St Totteringham's Day in 2017, the Telegraph indicated that the name ""St Arse's Day"" had been mooted as a possible name for an equivalent unofficial feast day. However, that does not seem to have caught on. St Hotspur Day - the name given to the day when Tottenham defeated Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final - could arguably be considered an equivalent to St Totteringham's Day. Part of the reason St Totteringham's Day became a thing was Arsenal's dominance during the late 1990s into the 2010s when Gunners fans became accustomed to finishing ahead of Spurs. Tottenham have come roaring back in more recent times and, if they can maintain that in the coming years, perhaps a new holiday title will emerge.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-st-totteringhams-day-arsenal-spurs-top-four-premier/lsnbmicl82jbz4ymppbp9xng,Ryan Kelly,7ed974a4-d12b-4906-9de3-b1030f720042
Klopp excited as 'special' Elliott signs new five-year Liverpool contract,"Jurgen Klopp has spoken of his excitement after ‚Äúspecial‚Äù talent Harvey Elliott signed a new five-year contract at Liverpool. The 19-year-old has put pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Anfield until at 2027, and which offers reward for his impressive progress with the Reds since joining from Fulham three years ago. Elliott, who placed fifth on the 2022 NXGN list of the world's best teenage footballers, is viewed by Liverpool as a star of the present as well as the future, and is looking to establish himself as a regular starter under Klopp this season. Elliott‚Äôs new deal is a five-year contract, which features a significant pay-rise. The teenager had signed an extension last summer, following an impressive season on loan with Blackburn Rovers, but this latest move sees him rewarded for his development within Liverpool‚Äôs senior set-up. Elliott was a starter in midfield this time last year, for example, only to suffer a serious ankle injury in a win at Leeds in September 2021. He battled back to return to action the following February, scoring his first competitive Liverpool goal in his comeback game against Cardiff City, and was part of the squad which won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, while going agonisingly close in both the Premier League and Champions League. Speaking to Liverpool's official website after penning his new deal, Elliott said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always nice to know that I‚Äôm going to be here for many more years, which is always a great thing with it being my boyhood club and there is nothing in this world that makes me more happy and more excited than this. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a big rollercoaster for me and my family and even for the club. So much has happened in the years that I have been here. Harvey Elliott has signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool!‚úçÔ∏èThe No #5 ranked NXGN 2022 baller for a reason üí´üì∏: Liverpool FC pic.twitter.com/BUCatOICX0 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already won so much and hopefully we can win so much more, so just to know that I am going to be here for a long time again ‚Äì as I said, it‚Äôs always a wonderful feeling for myself and my family [and] being Liverpool supporters there is no better place in this world to be than playing for Liverpool and to put the shirt on and go out and play for the team and the fans. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping there are many more memories to come with it but I‚Äôm just so excited to put pen to paper and stay here for a lot longer.‚Äù Klopp, meanwhile, expressed his satisfaction at the news, saying: ‚ÄúThere is so much to like about this. For us, as a club, we get to continue our journey with a special young player who has already made a big impact on Liverpool. ‚ÄúFor Harvey, he gets to carry on developing, improving and hopefully fulfilling his incredible talent at the club he has always supported. What‚Äôs not to like? ‚ÄúHarvey got a big knock last season but, like all of the experiences he has had so far, he used it to grow as a person and a player. ‚ÄúIt was always obvious that he was a good footballer but taking the next steps was always going to be about using information and experiences to grow and this is exactly what Harvey is doing. ‚ÄúNow it is all about carrying on enjoying his football as much as we enjoy watching him develop.

Man City's 'mentality monsters': Runaway leaders deserve more respect for fighting spirit,"Manchester City ended 2021 with the most victories in a calendar year and they started the new one in the same menacing manner. They didn't produce the performance of Premier League champions in Saturday's 2-1 triumph at Arsenal but it was undoubtedly the kind of result that wins titles. How Rodri's last-minute winner at the Emirates must have demoralised Chelsea and Liverpool. The midfielder and his team-mates can have a relaxing Sunday afternoon watching their two closest rivals face off at Stamford Bridge knowing that at least one of them will drop points. And if it wasn't already, it's now undoubtedly a must-win match for both Thomas Tuchel and Jurgen Klopp. Chelsea are now a whopping 11 points behind City. Third-placed Liverpool are a point further back, though the Reds do have a game in hand. In truth, it's hard to see how either side can catch up, not with City in this form. The win over Arsenal was their 11th in succession and even when they fail to hit their usual heights, they still find a way to pick up all three points. Pep Guardiola's players probably haven't endured a more difficult first half all season. They were outplayed for 45 minutes in north London and deservedly trailed 1-0 at the break, after Bukayo Saka's 31st-minute strike. However, Arsenal offered City a way back into the game, and City took full advantage. Man City move 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ points clear pic.twitter.com/yVkc0jcTvW Opinion is split on the VAR penalty awarded against Granit Xhaka for his challenge on Bernardo Silva, but the midfielder was certainly guilty of a clumsy challenge before then compounding his carelessness by needlessly grabbing the Portuguese attacker's shirt. Brazilian defender Gabriel deserves far less sympathy than his Swiss colleague for two ridiculous yellow cards, the first of which arrived for scuffing the penalty spot, just two minutes before he took out Gabriel Jesus with a clothesline. Even then, a 10-man Arsenal side proved difficult to break down as they reorganised themselves brilliantly to frustrate their visitors. However, three minutes into injury time, a hopeful cross into Aymeric Laporte dropped for Rodri to steer the ball home from close range. ""We were 1-0 down and things changed because of our mentality,"" the match-winner told BT Sport. ""We didn‚Äôt do a great game but we pushed, we never dropped. ""I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing there [in the penalty area] with Aymeric. It was crazy!"" Klopp may have claimed that the Premier League's Covid spike has not impacted on City but he should perhaps give more respect to their winning mentality. While the club has not confirmed any cases, John Stones, Olkesandr Zinchenko and Phil Foden were all described as ""not fully fit"", while Joao Cancelo played less than 48 hours after a run-in with thugs at his home. Title race over? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/9FXpFg75ZP Arsenal, meanwhile, may have been without manager Mikel Arteta, but had just short of a week to recover from their 5-0 win over Norwich, while City were back in London only two days after winning at Brentford. Squad restrictions meant Pep Guardiola made three changes to his starting line-up and admitted it affected his side. ""Congratulations [to my players],"" the Catalan said. ""Arsenal were better. We faced a team in the last year who struggled to be in the top four but they are there now and had six or seven days from their last game. ""We had two and a half, we came back and didn‚Äôt have energy."" Despite that, they kept pushing. In injury time, Bernardo Silva chased to get the ball back off a ballboy as Aaron Ramsdale feigned injury. At full-time, Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling slumped to the floor because of fatigue. The rest of the side summoned what energy they had left to gather in a huddle to celebrate a huge three points. It was a joyous scene that summed up their spirit and togetherness. ""We are not a team to score goals in injury time,"" Guardiola added. ""I don‚Äôt remember the last time we scored a goal after 90 minutes. ""Eleven wins in a row is so great in this period. Just take a look at our bench today: it was four guys from the Academy. ""We had many injuries. Today, we were mentally and physically tired. But sometimes the luck falls on our side."" Guardiola and his players, though, know exactly what's required to win titles. Saturday's victory at Arsenal will have only hammered that home to their already wavering rivals. City have ""mentality monsters"" of their own.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-mentality-monsters-runaway-leaders-deserve-more/blt75e90428558c6f7d,Jonathan Smith,8980d986-d36b-4a43-a78d-b67533e1b038
Manchester City goalkeeper Carson makes Champions League history with first appearance since 2005,"Manchester City goalkeeper Scott Carson has become the player with the largest gap between appearances in Champions League history. City defeated Sporting CP 5-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie last month, making Wednesday's second leg at the Etihad Stadium all but a formality. Carson, 36, came on as a second-half substitute for Ederson, appearing in the competition for the first time since April 2005 when he played for Liverpool at 19 years old. ""Scott is very important,"" City manager Pep Guardiola said after the game. ""The reason is the chemistry in the locker room with Eddie and Zack.

Arsenal striker Aubameyang tests positive for Covid-19 just days before Gabon's AFCON opener,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has tested positive for coronavirus just days before the start of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), GOAL can confirm, putting his participation for at least some of the tournament in doubt. Aubameyang has suffered a turbulent few weeks, losing his place in the Arsenal team after being dropped by manager Mikel Arteta due to a disciplinary breach. He was also stripped of the captaincy by Mikel Arteta and, having played little football recently, was hoping to make a big impact at AFCON, which gets underway on January 9, when hosts Cameroon face Burkina Faso. AFCON 2022 begins on Sunday, with Gabon playing their opening group-stage fixture against Comoros the day after, on January 10. They play Ghana four days later before concluding their pool-stage matches against Morocco on January 18. Should Aubameyang be forced into isolation due to testing positive, he would be doubtful to feature in at least the first game, while it is unclear at this stage if he would then be unable to participate in the rest of the competition. The former Dortmund striker has already missed games for Arsenal in the first half of the 2021-22 campaign due to testing positive for Covid-19. The Gabonese FA posted photos of the squad arriving in Cameroon on January 6, before news of Aubameyang's positive test came to light. The Gunners forward can be seen in one of the images, although it's unclear if he is now in isolation.

Mane becomes highest-scoring Senegal player of all time as he overtakes Camara with hat-trick,"Sadio Mane‚Äôs hat-trick against Benin has seen him leapfrog Henri Camara to become the highest-scoring Senegal player in international football history. In Saturday‚Äôs 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification fixture against the Squirrels, the Liverpool star found the net on three occasions to inspire Aliou Cisse‚Äôs men to a 3-1 victory in Dakar in the Group L match. Prior to the game, the Liverpool star had scored 29 goals on the international scene, a feat also achieved by Camara, who represented the West Africans between 1999 and 2008 in 99 appearances. With Saturday's game just 12 minutes old, the 30-year-old put his country ahead from the penalty spot after referee Alaa Sabry judged that David Kiki handled the ball in the penalty area. While Michel Dussuyer‚Äôs Benin were hoping to regroup, Mane doubled Senegal‚Äôs advantage 10 minutes later,  drilling Nampalys Mendy's assist past goalkeeper Saturnin Allagbe. Benin's ambition for a comeback suffered a massive blow as Sessi D'Almeida was given his marching orders in the 51st minute for dangerous play against Mane. At the hour mark, the reigning African Player of the Year completed his treble via another penalty. This time, it was Allagbe who fouled Ismaila Sarr in the box. Even after numerous scoring opportunities came their way plus the visitors‚Äô numerical disadvantage, Aliou Cisse‚Äôs men could not increase their lead. In the 88th minute, the Squirrels pulled one back thanks to sub Junior Olaitan. This was former Southampton player Mane‚Äôs first international hat-trick since his debut in 2012, and his first in a full senior match, with his previous coming for the Senegalese U23 team at the 2012 Olympic tournament. While he remains committed to Senegal, it is a different story at club level with Mane claiming he will do what ""60 to 70 per cent"" of Senegalese people want him to do, which is to apparently leave Liverpool. As revealed by GOAL, Mane is set to inform Jurgen Klopp's side of his desire to leave this summer, with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich leading the race to sign him.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-overtakes-camara-to-become-highest-scoring-senegal/bltae1943e188c198bc,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,e4053d01-71c3-471e-a854-0cf76745e19b
Lloris signs new Spurs contract to 2024 as World Cup-winning goalkeeper ends uncertainty over his future,"Hugo Lloris has signed a new contract at Tottenham that will keep him at the club until the summer of 2024. The World Cup-winning France international goalkeeper has already spent a decadeat Spurs making close to 400 appearances, and has agreed to extend his association with the Premier League heavyweights. He is club captain in north London and, with fresh terms agreed, appears set to remain first choice between the sticks as Antonio Conte ushers in a new era for a team desperate to end a long wait for major silverware. A statement on the club‚Äôs official website reads: ‚ÄúWe are delighted to announce that Hugo Lloris has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract with the club, which will run until 2024. ‚ÄúCaptain of club and country, World Cup and UEFA Nations League winner with France, Hugo, 35, has racked up 395 appearances since his arrival from Lyon in August 2012. ""Already 14th in our all-time appearance list, he will soon become only the 12th player to make 400-plus appearances for us in all competitions.

Speculation suggested Conte, who took the managerial reins from Nuno Espirito Santo in November, was ready to let the veteran move on as a free agent.

Chelsea takeover: Saudi investor Amr Zedan becomes eighth public bidder as process drags on,"Amr Zedan, a Los Angeles-born Saudi investor, is the latest individual to have made an offer to buy Chelsea, GOAL can reveal. The 47-year-old is the chairman of Zedan Group, a company involved in the energy and petrochemical sectors in Saudi Arabia, along with an interest in horse racing through Zedan Racing Stables. Like other bidders, he is thought to have looked for extra finance after the deadline passed and is considered to have an outside chance of winning. This is the case even with his connections to Jordan's royal family, through his marriage to¬†Princess Noor Bint Asem, factored in. Chelsea's board will ultimately decide who the new owners will be but they are being advised by Raine Group, a New York investment bank, who were initially appointed by sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich. Raine Group is behind on their attempts to reduce the potential future owners down to a small shortlist of 'preferred bidders'. However, they are attempting to run a process that can usually take several months in under a week, with further checks to be made in the next phase on every aspect of any consortium. The Blues had hoped to get a new owner in at the end of March but that seems almost impossible now, with the process set to drag on. It comes amid fears that the ownership situation is proving a distraction to Chelsea's sports team, as well as concerns over cash flow. The UK Government is involved in the process but won't impose themselves on decision making, seeking only to ensure that none of the money derived from the Chelsea takeover process ends up with owner Abramovich. There are several known bidders with the Chicago Cubs-owned Ricketts family among those attempting to buy Chelsea. There's also a reported ¬£2 billion ($2.6bn) offer from Woody Johnson, who owns the New York Jets. Todd Boehly's consortium, which own the Los Angeles Dodgers and features further backing from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and Englishman Jonathan Goldstein, are also in the running. There's also Saudi Media's competitive bid, which was first revealed by GOAL, and hopes to make the next phase. From the United Kingdom, there's an offer from Nick Candy, who is backed by a Catalina Kim-led South Korean consortium for up to a ¬£1bn stake in the west Londoners. Former Blues striker Gianluca Vialli is involved in Candy's bid through his company Tifosy Capital and Advisory, with AC Milan investors Elliott Management also rumoured to be providing backing. Sir Martin Broughton is leading another English bid and has brought in Lord Sebastian Coe, a Conservative Party MP. They are thought to have backing from Crystal Palace's American co-owners, Josh Harris and David Blitzer, which could be problematic in the process. Furthermore, Centricus, the London-based global investment firm, have confirmed their ¬£3bn ($4bn) bid to buy Chelsea. In total there are eight known options for Chelsea to work through as they finalise this phase of their new owner selection process.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-takeover-saudi-investor-amr-zedan-eighth-bidder/blt8b4932cade2cec66,Nizaar Kinsella,2ccd31f7-36ee-4f33-bb3e-7e0c5e38220a
Arsenal's loss is Newcastle's gain: Bruno Guimaraes the statement signing Magpies were seeking,"Newcastle are set to truly showcase their status as ""the richest club in the world"" when they sign Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon. The St James‚Äô Park club are ready to pay up to ¬£43 million ($57.5m) for the Brazil international, with ¬£35m ($47m) of that an up-front fee and the remainder in potential bonuses. Having been mocked for their amateurish attempts to sign Hugo Ekitike for Reims by including what the French club branded ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù bonus clauses in the deal, Newcastle are set to add a Ligue 1 player to their ranks that will genuinely have clubs envious. After all, Guimaraes is a player who has attracted the attention of both Arsenal and Juventus in recent weeks ‚Äì two clubs who have long been recognised as heavyweights in the European game. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta even admitted that he wanted to sign an additional central midfielder this January. It appears that one he really wanted is heading to the north east. And though Guimaraes may not be a name recognised in England, the 24-year-old is a player worthy of a club with Champions League ambitions. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal that clubs are interested in you when you are an Olympic champion, called up to the full national side and you are playing well,‚Äù he told Globo Esporte earlier in January. Such high-profile interest is nothing new.  Atletico Madrid were desperate to sign him in January 2020, but instead he moved to Lyon, where the influence of Juninho as sporting director proved critical. It has proven to be a profitable move for both the player and the club, with OL set to more than double the fee they paid for him only two years ago. Of course, life was complicated in Lyon for the Brazilian initially, with the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic hampering his integration into the squad.  This did not stop him impressing against Juventus as Lyon progressed all the way to the Champions League semi-finals in August. He has since earned a reputation as a player who can struggle on the big occasion, though a recent blockbuster performance against Paris Saint-Germain in a 1-1 draw should have allayed some of those fears and is doubtless one of the reasons that Newcastle have moved for him. Although branded a box-to-box midfielder, Bruno is a player who does much of his work defensively.  He is certainly classy with the ball at his feet and possesses impressive vision, but his return of three goals in 71 Lyon appearances gives an accurate picture of just how often he finds himself around the opponents‚Äô penalty area. Nevertheless, he has hinted that he could show more in his game if given the freedom. ‚ÄúIn France, there are times when we play like robots,‚Äù he told Globo this week. ‚ÄúNobody tries to dribble, to find a pass, for example. It irritates me sometimes.‚Äù Playing with Allan Saint-Maximin, then, should be right up his street. Meanwhile, he rates well compared to his Ligue 1 peers in all aspects of his defensive game, justifying his reputation as a ball winner. Mentally, too, Guimaraes is a player who demands the most from those around him ‚Äì seemingly ideal for Newcastle in their present situation. ‚ÄúWe always say that we‚Äôre not in the right league position, but we‚Äôve not done much else to show that,‚Äù he said following a 1-1 draw with relegation-threatened Metz in December that left Lyon in the lower half of the Ligue 1 table over the winter break. ‚ÄúIt disgusts me, it hurts me. I‚Äôm going to have a bad Christmas because of this.‚Äù With Juninho, his great mentor, departing the club after a failed stint as sporting director, this proved to be the beginning of the end for Bruno in France.  While the fan of Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Toni Kroos had hinted that he might like a move to Spain, it is the Premier League that has opened its doors for him as he continues to steady march to the top of the game. Now, he promises to be Newcastle‚Äôs first big statement signing of the Saudi era and he is a player who can underpin the success of the club for years to come.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bruno-guimaraes-statement-signing-newcastle/blt2245727b8352d3bb,Robin Bairner,52fbaac9-5b74-4e09-964e-1a2b4e6ec713
Kenya‚Äôs Okumu scores first goal as KAA Gent defeat KV Mechelen in Belgian league,"Kenya international Joseph Okumu was on target as KAA Gent defeated KV Mechelen 1-0 in a Belgian Pro League fixture at Ghelamco Arena on Saturday. The 24-year-old lanky defender powered home with a header in the 82nd minute to help the Buffalos pick a second straight victory, having won the last meeting 3-1 against Sporting Charleroi. Okumu, who joined Gent from Swedish side IF Elfsborg, has explained his goal saying he has been training on many occasions to score from such opportunities and was happy it yielded maximum points for his side. ‚ÄúWe trained on stationary phases. Then it‚Äôs nice that it works in the game and results in a goal,‚Äù Okumu told the club‚Äôs official website after the game. ‚ÄúI am especially happy that we won, because KV Mechelen is a good team with a good organization.‚Äù It was Gent, who started the game on a high and they should have taken the lead with only six minutes played when Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe combined well with Julien De Sart and from the resultant ball, they put through Tarik Tissoudali but from a one-on-one situation, his weak effort was put out by goalkeeper Gaetan Coucke. 1-0!!!

Rangnick suggests Man Utd players should vote for next captain amid questions of Maguire‚Äôs future,"Harry Maguire is facing further questions of his standing as Manchester United captain after seeing Ralf Rangnick stop short of recommending him as skipper to incoming manager Erik ten Hag, with the Red Devils‚Äô interim boss suggesting that a player vote should determine who fills the armband. An ¬£80 million ($100m) centre-half inherited a prestigious role at Old Trafford in the wake of Ashley Young‚Äôs departure to Inter in January 2020, with a leadership position passed his way within months of completing a record-setting transfer from Leicester. Maguire boasts the experience required to accept such responsibility, but he has struggled for form in recent times and, with a knee injury currently keeping him on the sidelines, Rangnick has stated that a squad poll should be held ahead of a big captaincy call for a new head coach in 2022-23. Quizzed on whether he will be urging Ten Hag to stick with Maguire as United‚Äôs on-field leader when a change is made in the dugout this summer, Rangnick has said: ‚ÄúI understand your question but again it doesn‚Äôt make sense because we don‚Äôt know what kind of players will be here, what the group will look like. ‚ÄúI can only tell you what I have done in the past when I was head coach or manager because in Germany it‚Äôs called Mannschaftskapitan ‚Äì the captain of the team. ‚ÄúI strongly believe the captain should be elected by the team. ‚ÄúWe always had a board of four or five players ‚Äì we called it the Spielerrat [players‚Äô council] ‚Äì elected by the players. The player with the highest amount of votes was the team captain at the end. That was how I did it. ‚ÄúI know a lot of head coaches don‚Äôt do it that way. That‚Äôs what I would do if I was still the manager next season, but in the end I‚Äôm not. This is something that Erik will have to decide.‚Äù Maguire has struggled to provide the necessary level of inspiration as skipper this season, with United seemingly destined to miss out on a top-four finish and Champions League qualification. An untimely injury is also doing his cause few favours, but Rangnick has previously shrugged off claims that he could look to hand the armband to five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Cristiano Ronaldo on a permanent basis. He said back in February: ‚ÄúWell, to start with, I must say that this is absolutely nonsense. ‚ÄúI have never spoken with any player about a possible change of captaincy and Harry is fully aware of that and so is Cristiano, and all the other players. ‚ÄúSo this has never been an issue for me, it is me who decides the captain and therefore there is no reason to speak about that with any other person. ‚ÄúHarry is our captain and will stay our captain until the end of the season and there is nothing else to add on to that.‚Äù United will, with someone other than Maguire filling their armband, be back in Premier League action on Thursday when playing host to Chelsea. Ahead of that contest, Rangnick has also told Sky Sports that there is no truth to the rumours claiming that he has criticised the professionalism of certain players in a report that will be passed to Ten Hag. He has said: ""This is completely false, completely untrue. The board has never asked me to prepare a dossier, neither for the board nor for Erik.

AC Milan star Leao responds to Real Madrid transfer links,"AC Milan star Rafael Leao admits that he is flattered by transfer links to Real Madrid, but wants to continue to shine with the Serie A champions. Leao, 22, netted 11 goals for the Rossoneri as they pipped city rivals Inter to the crown.  It was their first league title since 2010-11 and the Portuguese striker believes both he and the club can go on to greater things together.  ‚ÄúI am at Milan, I have another two years left on my contract and I feel at home there. I am happy to hear Milan say I am untouchable,‚Äù Leao explained to A Bola when asked about the Madrid reports. ‚ÄúThe rumours about Real Madrid interest make me happy, but I am keeping my feet firmly on the ground. I am proud to work with such experienced players.‚Äù Leao first moved to Milan from Sporting as a teenager, and took time to establish himself at San Siro.  The 2021-22 season proved a breakout year for the forward though as he topped double figures in goals for the first time, and he believes this is only the beginning. ‚ÄúI left Sporting very young in 2018 and went to Lille. People might not realise it, but Ligue 1 is a strong league too and I evolved from there,"" he added. ‚ÄúThe first two years didn‚Äôt go the way I wanted at Milan, but now I am more mature and feel more confident in myself. I want to be a reference point for my club and national side.

"Beckham brings Man Utd expectations to Inter Miami, says Neville","David Beckham is ‚Äúnot happy‚Äù when Inter Miami draw a game and ‚Äúmore than unhappy‚Äù when they lose, admits Phil Neville, with the former England captain looking to replicate standards once set at Manchester United in his latest footballing venture. The Red Devils and Real Madrid legend is one of the co-owners at a MLS expansion franchise that made its bow on a prominent North American stage in 2020. Progress has been slow in Florida, with results on the field yet to match shows of ambition off it, with Neville currently learning the hard way how difficult it can be to meet the expectations of a fellow Class of ‚Äò92 graduate that he once played alongside at Old Trafford. Inter Miami have, after finishing 11th in their Conference last season and 20th overall, stumbled out of the blocks in 2022 to take just four points from six games. They are a long way short of hitting ultimate targets at present, with Neville telling MUTV of the demands placed on him by Beckham: ‚ÄúDavid and his ambition to make this club global was probably one of the biggest [reasons]. ‚ÄúI am quite ambitious as a manager, I want to manage at the top level and the plans that David and the [other] owners have got for this football club are huge. He wants Inter Miami to be known worldwide. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new club, we are starting fresh and David is building his own club. He was the big influence for me as I know how much he wants this to be a success.‚Äù Former England Women‚Äôs boss Neville, who linked up with Inter Miami in January 2021, added on Beckham: ‚ÄúHis standards are so high, if we draw a game he‚Äôs not happy and if we lose a game he‚Äôs more than unhappy. ‚ÄúHe wants us to win the league and he wants us to win competitions, that‚Äôs the type of expectations we had at Manchester United. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt just want to be an MLS team, they want to be a worldwide brand, they want to compete in the North American equivalent of the Champions League.‚Äù Questions have been asked of Neville‚Äôs ongoing presence in Fort Lauderdale as he struggles to generate results but he is ‚Äì with his son Harvey and Beckham‚Äôs son Romeo forming of the set-up at Inter Miami ‚Äì thoroughly enjoying his time in the States. He has said of embracing a new challenge: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a brilliant way of life out here. ‚ÄúI'm obviously at a new football club where it‚Äôs new and it‚Äôs just starting to take off and has brilliant expectations.

Ibrahimovic declares himself the greatest ever MLS player: 'I was still too alive',"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has declared himself the ‚Äúbest player to ever play in MLS‚Äù and claimed he was ‚Äútoo good for the whole competition‚Äù during his two-year spell with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Ibrahimovic scored 53 goals in 58 appearances for the Galaxy over two seasons between 2018 and 2019 before returning to Milan in Serie A. Despite leaving Galaxy empty handed, with the club failing to make the play-offs in 2018 before losing in the Western Conference semi-finals the following year, Ibrahimovic still thinks his impact warrants him the number one position. Ibrahimovic joined the Galaxy in March 2018 after his contract at Manchester United was terminated early. The then 36-year-old had only just returned from a serious knee injury the previous November and says the move across the Atlantic helped him regain full match fitness. ""I'm very happy. I'm very thankful for MLS because they gave me the chance to feel alive.‚Äù He told ESPN. ‚ÄúBut the problem was I was still too alive. So I was too good for the whole competition. That is what I showed. And I'm the best ever to play in MLS and that is not me having ego or trying to show off now. That is true. ""And when I was there, I enjoyed [it]. I had a good time. And I like the way they were working, the way they were doing the marketing stuff. ""And I think [playing in MLS] was the best way for me to come back after my injury. I was in the best condition ever. And I'm very proud I played for the MLS, because they were saying to me the stadiums are pretty empty when you play in that. ""There was no empty stadiums when I was playing. It was even overbooked, so I cannot complain, and I'm very happy I was there."" Ibrahimovic is still playing at the highest level despite being the age of 40, though injuries have limited him to 24 appearances for Milan in all competitions so far this season. His contract expires in the summer and there had been speculation he could retire - something he emphatically denied earlier this month. When quizzed on his future, the former Sweden striker did not rule out a return to the United States, either as a player or following in David Beckham‚Äôs footsteps and buying a franchise of his own. ""You never know - maybe one day I'll come back,"" Ibrahimovic said. ""So to show them how, to give them a reminder what real football is. ""So it's for two years. They get to see what real football is and I think they will never see something like that before. Maybe I come back and have my own club -- you'll never know.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ibrahimovic-declares-himself-the-greatest-ever-mls-player-i/blt65c1cd38a32794b3,Tom Mallows,2ad4e9cc-35bb-4466-bdc8-cb2ad7fce124
Iwobi describes Everton season as 'most mentally challenging' in his career,"Everton winger Alex Iwobi has described the just concluded Premier League season as the ‚Äúmost mentally challenging of my career‚Äù after his side were in the relegation battle. The 26-year-old Nigeria international was in the thick of things for the Toffees and their safety was confirmed with a game to spare after they defeated Crystal Palace 3-2 at Goodison Park last week. Everton headed into their final game of the season against Arsenal having confirmed their safety and despite losing 5-1, Iwobi admitted he was proud to have helped the team keep their status in the top-flight. ‚ÄúThe most mentally challenging season of my career so far is over and I‚Äôm proud to have come out of the other side stronger, sharper, and hungrier than ever!‚Äù Iwobi wrote on his Twitter handle.

The rest included a 1-0 victory against Chelsea, 2-1 victory against Leicester, 0-0 draw against Everton, 3-2 defeat against Brentford, 3-2 win against Palace, and the most recent 5-1 defeat against Arsenal at the Emirates.

"Napoli vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona travel to the Stadio San Paolo on Thursday evening to face Napoli in the second leg of their last-32 clash in the Europa League. The two sides played out a 1-1 draw at Camp Nou last week, leaving the tie finely poised ahead of this week's encounter in Italy. The hosts lost their first home game in the tournament this season 3-2 to Spartak Moscow, although they responded with two subsequent victories in front of their own fans. Napoli are priced at 17/10 (2.70) with bet365, while Barca can be backed at 8/5 (2.60) and the draw is offered at 12/5 (3.40). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his first La Liga start for Barcelona at the weekend. The former Arsenal captain is priced at 9/2 (5.50) to break the deadlock, the same odds as Napoli's Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen. Dries Mertens, meanwhile, is available at 5/1 (6.00) while Ferran Torres is offered at 6/1 (7.00). Luciano Spalletti's men have been in strong scoring form in Europe this season and they will expect to continue that against a Barca team that have been conceding goals regularly. Indeed, last week's first leg should have seen more goals at both ends with Ferran Torres particularly wasteful and backing a high-scoring game in Naples should appeal. With away goals no longer holding greater value, Napoli will not try and defend their first-leg result, while Barca under Xavi Hernandez will always look to take the initiative and score goals. The new manager may have the side playing in a more attractive manner than his predecessor, yet Xavi's Barcelona are still exceptionally vulnerable defensively, keeping just four clean sheets in the 18 matches they have contested since the former midfielder took the helm. Both teams to score is priced at 4/6 (1.65) but combining this selection with over 2.5 goals sees the odds rise to a more appealing 11/10 (2.10). Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+. begambleaware.org    Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 11/10 (2.10) for a 1pt stake with bet365 Bet365 have launched their biggest ever free spins giveaway, available to new and existing customers, click here for details Ts & Cs bet365 3.65 Million Free Spins Giveaway ‚Äì Have a minimum of ¬£10 in lifetime deposits to bet365 and win up to 500 Free Spins.¬† Min. ¬£10 in lifetime deposits required.

"Fernandes responds to claims of 'dig' at Man Utd captain Maguire, saying: People question everything at this club","Bruno Fernandes has rubbished reports suggesting that an image and caption he posted on social media could be considered a dig at Manchester United captain Harry Maguire. There has been plenty of speculation at Old Trafford recently regarding the supposed emergence of rifts in the Red Devils camp, with questions being asked of whether Cristiano Ronaldo should skipper the team as others struggle for form. Fernandes fanned those flames when sharing a picture of him working with Eric Bailly and Raphael Varane in training, with the Portugal international saying he was ‚Äúfeeling very safe‚Äù between two centre-halves that are competing with Maguire for game time. After seeing an innocent message spark an unnecessary backlash, Fernandes told Premier League Productions: ""Honestly, I think people question everything at this club. Every week we have a new story about something. ""I posted a photo on Instagram where I was with Rapha and Eric and I said, 'I feel very secure in the middle with these two.' ""Meaning, 'security' like if [someone] comes they are like my bodyguards. And people were complaining I was throwing something at Maguire. ""But Maguire was not the only defender who was not in the photo. [Victor] Lindelof was not in the photo, Phil Jones was not in the photo. ""People want to complain and want to make stories around us, but the most important [thing] is that we stick together and do our jobs on the pitch. ""Obviously, everyone is really happy with H because it‚Äôs really tough being in his place in the last period. Honestly, we all have bad games. ""And when we don‚Äôt win it‚Äôs not because H is not playing well, or Bruno is not playing well, it‚Äôs because the team is not playing well and it‚Äôs not performing in the right way. ""For us inside the dressing room is not where we blame someone, but [to] understand how we come out of bad situations."" Maguire has responded to the talk of divides at United by saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen a lot of reports about this club that aren‚Äôt true.‚Äù Five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Ronaldo has taken aim at the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù which continues to be generated by those outside of the United camp, while Marcus Rashford has said of the rift talk: ‚ÄúAre we just making it up as we go along now then?

How much will it cost PSG to sack Man Utd-linked Pochettino and his coaching staff?,"Mauricio Pochettino is facing serious questions of his future at Paris Saint-Germain after failing to progress past the last 16 of the Champions League despite having the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe at his disposal. With European glory eluding the Ligue 1 heavyweights once again, there has been plenty of talk to suggest that another change in the dugout will be made this summer. Pochettino is already being linked with prominent posts elsewhere, with Manchester United considered to be long-standing suitors of the former Tottenham coach, but parting with the Argentine will be an expensive business for PSG. The 50-year-old is tied to a contract at Parc des Princes through to 2023, so still has over 12 months left to run on that agreement. With that taken into account, L‚ÄôEquipe reports that it would cost PSG around ‚Ç¨20 million (¬£17m/$22m) to part with their entire coaching team. That redundancy package would include a ‚Ç¨15m (¬£13m/$16m) compensation fee for Pochettino, while his four assistants would split ‚Ç¨5m (¬£4m/$5m). It is reported that Jesus Perez, who is Pochettino‚Äôs right-hand man, is working on a salary of ‚Ç¨80,000 a month, while Miguel D‚ÄôAgostino and Toni Jimenez pull in ‚Ç¨50,000 each and Sebastino Pochettino ‚Äì Mauricio‚Äôs son ‚Äì earns ‚Ç¨20,000. Mauricio Pochettino wants to stop talking about the Man Utd job ü§´ pic.twitter.com/CFigKrUJpN PSG are said to have regrets over offering extensions to their management team at the start of the current campaign, with initial deals thrashed out in January 2021 only set to run until the summer of 2022. The Ligue 1 heavyweights have been in this position before, with some hefty severance payments made in the recent past. Current Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, whose departure paved the way for Pochettino to be appointed, received between ‚Ç¨7-8m (¬£7m/$9m) when seeing his contract ripped up, while Laurent Blanc departed with ‚Ç¨22m (¬£18m/$24m) in June 2016. Pochettino is far and away the best-paid coach in French football, with his base salary said to be three times higher than that of his closest rivals Jorge Sampaoli and Christophe Galtier - who earn around ‚Ç¨330,000 a month at Marseille and Nice respectively. The man in charge at PSG would also be the highest-paid coach in Germany when Bundesliga wage packets are taken into account, with Julian Nagelsmann pulling in ‚Ç¨666,000 on a monthly basis at Bayern Munich. Pochettino does, however, sit some way down the global payment chart, with the likes of Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp earning more than him at Premier League giants Manchester City and Liverpool. It is, however, Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone that boasts the most lucrative coaching contract, with Pochettino‚Äôs fellow countryman working on a deal that is reportedly worth ‚Ç¨3.33m a month.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-much-cost-psg-sack-man-utd-linked-pochettino-coaching/blt45da21feba58e5e6,Chris Burton,5e5a42a6-6a0f-426d-8767-524c62a88556

Why was Messi left out of PSG's clash with Monaco? Seven-time Ballon d'Or winner's absence explained,"Why was Lionel Messi left out of Paris Saint-Germain's clash with Monaco? GOAL is here to explain the reason behind the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner's surprise absence. PSG arrived at Stade Louis II on Sunday looking to take another big step towards the Ligue 1 title, with Mauricio Pochettino's side boasting a commanding 16 point lead at the top of the table after 29 games. Messi was not included in Pochettino's final 21-man squad for the trip to Monaco, though, raising fears over his fitness heading into the business end of the season. Messi was one of seven first-team players unable to make the final squad, with the likes of Sergio Ramos and Angel Di Maria missing out through injury. PSG gave a short explanation for each players' absence on their official website, and Messi was declared unavailable due to a bout of flu, which he has been treated for over the past three days. üÜó‚úîÔ∏è The Parisian squad üÜö @AS_Monaco_EN  #ASMPSG https://t.co/ZXU7lnU11J pic.twitter.com/WjbLbygbsG No official time frame has been given for Messi's recovery, but supporters will hope that he will be back to full fitness after the international break.

Messi's first season at PSG has been disrupted by a number of fitness issues, with the forward managing just 26 appearances across all competitions for the club to date. The former Barcelona superstar, who moved to Parc des Princes on a free transfer last summer, has now missed 11 games due to a combination of injuries and illness, which goes some way to explaining his modest contribution of just seven goals and 11 assists.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-was-messi-left-out-of-psg-clash-monaco-absence-explained/blt7b34f221ea06e488,James Westwood,1d7b6fbe-1ff6-46cf-b135-a809450a6315

But Xhaka says he meant to include himself in those remarks and was referring to the club's mentality as a whole. The defeat to Newcastle dealt a crushing blow to Arsenal's top-four hopes, as they eventually finished below Tottenham for the final Champions League qualification spot. ""I don't know why we're not doing what the coach is asking for us,"" Xhaka told Sky Sports following the May 16 defeat. ""If someone isn't ready for this game, stay at home. It doesn't matter your age. If you're nervous, stay on the bench or stay at home. You need people to have the balls to come here and play. It's one of the most important games for us. We're feeling very disappointed for the people who came over here."" ""This was not against our young players,"" Xhaka told ESPN. ""I put myself there as well. We were not ready for this game, to fight. ""We knew if we won this game, we would have another final against Everton at home [on the last day of the Premier League season]. ""The thing is about the mentality - when you have something, you can take it - it is not the first time we let it down. ""A lot of people start to think, ‚ÄòYeah he‚Äôs speaking again,‚Äô and stuff like this, but maybe they didn‚Äôt understand what and how I meant it. ""If I can say now something about this interview, I told you: this has nothing to do with the young players, it is to do with us all together.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-xhaka-clarifies-controversial-balls-comment/blt87731d4e5cebb9e2,Dan Bernstein,29f1dc13-9d50-47fe-a7f6-73ee490c9ef9
'It's a clear red' - Azpilicueta & Tuchel fume over early Mane challenge in Chelsea draw with Liverpool,"Cesar Azpilicueta and Thomas Tuchel both insisted that Sadio Mane should have been handed a straight red card for his opening-minute challenge in Chelsea's 2-2 Premier League draw with Liverpool. The Blues skipper was elbowed in the face by the Reds attacker almost immediately after the whistle went as the two jumped for a high ball, but Mane escaped with only a yellow card and subsequently netted the visitors' opener at Stamford Bridge. Mohamed Salah doubled the lead before Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic struck back to tie things up in a draw that damaged both teams' hopes of a title challenge against Manchester City. ""It's a clear red. I don't mind if it's five seconds into the game, it's the first action and it's a clear red,"" Azpilicueta told Sky Sports after the full-time whistle. ""He doesn't see the ball, he just wants to lead with the elbow. I honestly don't understand it. ""It was a clear red card. We're getting these decisions against us which could change the course of the game. ""We don't see consistency even within the same game, and to me it's clear a decision like this is clear. I watched the replay, but I didn't need to. It was a clear red."" Chelsea boss Tuchel agreed with his right-back, adding: ""I am not a friend of early red cards. I hate to say it because I love Mane and he is a nice guy and top player, but it is a red card.  ""The elbow is in the face - it doesn't matter if you do this after 20 seconds or 20 minutes."" Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson defended his team-mate, playing down suggestions that the foul was intentional and even suggesting a booking was too harsh for the attacker. ""I was disappointed with the yellow card to be honest,"" the England international told Match of the Day after the game concluded. ""Sadio is always going to try and win it. His eyes are always on the ball, I don't think there was intent there."" Though the Senegal international dodged a dismissal, his yellow card still made modern-day Premier League history with the speed at which it was earned. With a yellow after just 15 seconds, he became the fastest-booked player in the history of the competition since records began in the 2006-07 season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/it-s-a-clear-red-azpilicueta-and-tuchel-fume-over-early-mane/blt51236722e6ac74eb,Andrew Steel,731633c0-dcd7-44c8-8b63-e59f5cc24cc1
Matip goal against Leeds makes Liverpool boss Klopp break into hysterical laughter,"Liverpool centre-back Joel Matip made manager Jurgen Klopp burst out laughing on Wednesday when he rushed forwards from the back to score a goal from open play against Leeds. Matip, not known for his goalscoring, played a one-two with Mohamed Salah before unleashing a cool finish past the goalkeeper. And Klopp absolutely loved the exchange, celebrating with a big smile along with his assistants as the Reds ran away with an eventual 6-0 win. The defender's 30th-minute finish put Liverpool ahead 2-0 before Salah added a third before half-time. It was Matip's sixth career Premier League goal, and he has now scored in every season he's been at the club. It is ALL Liverpool at Anfield.

Ten Hag told to drop Ronaldo for Liverpool clash as Rooney highlights Man Utd's lack of energy - while also questioning Casemiro transfer,"Wayne Rooney has told Manchester United boss Erik Ten Hag to focus on getting ""energy"" on the pitch against bitter rivals Liverpool, even if it does come at the expense of Cristiano Ronaldo. The D.C. United manager feels that his former team-mate looked unfit during the Red Devils' shocking 4-0 loss at Brentford last time out, which saw them fall to the bottom of the table for the first time in 30 years. Rooney doesn't think that Marcus Rashford should make the starting XI on Monday night either and says his recent form should be a ""real concern"" for Ten Hag going forward. The United legend, who became the club's all-time record scorer between 2004 and 2017, has told The Times: ""I wouldn‚Äôt play Cristiano Ronaldo, and I wouldn‚Äôt play Marcus Rashford. ""If I was in Ten Hag‚Äôs position my main concern would be getting energy on the pitch, and United‚Äôs failure to recruit a number nine means they relied on Ronaldo against¬†Brentford, even though he hadn‚Äôt trained a lot with the team.¬† ""He looked like he needs time to get match fit. Ten Hag needs energy from his side and that may mean dropping Ronaldo."" Rooney added on Rashford's struggles: ""As for Marcus, I think he needs to do a lot of soul-searching and figure out what he wants, for his own good, before anything else.  ""Because watching him is a real concern, he looks like he wants to be anywhere but on a football pitch."" United fans have been given a timely boost ahead of the clash with Liverpool, as the club has confirmed an agreement is now in place for Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro to complete a ¬£60 million ($71m) switch to Old Trafford. However, Rooney has described the move as a ""reactive signing"" and feels long-term target Frenkie de Jong would have been a better fit. ""This goes back to the need to look to the future,"" he said. ""Ideally, they should be signing players in their early to mid-twenties, and Casemiro is similar to Christian Eriksen - someone who has been a good player, but are they going to help the club move forward? Frenkie de Jong, Ten Hag‚Äôs principal midfield target, would be a better fit. ""The Casemiro deal seems too have come from nowhere, and looks a reactive signing - I‚Äôd be surprised if he was a player identified as a priority to bring in when ten Hag arrived.¬† ""It looks like, having been unable to sign De Jong, United just reacted to Casemiro being available.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ten-hag-drop-ronaldo-liverpool-rooney-man-utd-energy-questioning-/blt8147816b78efc54a,Ewan Gennery,844c9bf7-4401-4fe1-a43f-78eec79dc7cd
How bad is Liverpool midfielder Thiago's injury & how many games will he miss?,"Liverpool endured a tough start to the new Premier League season by drawing 2-2 away at newly-promoted Fulham, and their day was made even worse by an injury to midfielder Thiago. The Spaniard limped off the pitch just six minutes into the second half after what looked like a rather innocuous incident.  The Reds' current injury list is already quite expansive with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Curtis Jones, Diogo Jota, Kostas Tsimikas and Ibrahima Konate all sidelined, while Naby Keita is only just back in training after illness. Liverpool have not revealed how serious the injury is just yet and have confirmed only that Thiago ""will undergo further assessment to determine the severity of it [the injury]."" The Reds do have over a week until their next Premier League outing. Crystal Palace are the first visitors to Anfield this season in the Premier League with the teams set to meet on August 15. After that, on August 22, the Merseyside team will play a headline clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford, followed by a home game against Bournemouth five days later before they welcome Newcastle to Anfield on August 31. Liverpool still have several midfielders fit, notably Jordan Henderson, Fabinho and James Milner. Towards the end of the game Jurgen Klopp was also able to call on the services of ex-Fulham youngsters Harvey Elliott and Fabio Carvalho.  The Liverpool boss spoke about the issue after the game and was adamant that the club must not panic in the transfer window after losing several key players due to injury.  ""I know what will now come up, it's clear. We said we don‚Äôt need a midfielder because we have enough - and we actually have enough, but the problem now is we get punished for something that is not our responsibility really because things like this can happen.¬† ""Nobody could image that Curtis gets the thing he gets; it is nothing serious but he is a young boy and it is a kind of stress reaction. Bodies are like this. Naby is only ill and he will now be back definitely next week again. Oxlade happened early and now with Thiago that is, of course, not good and we will see.¬† ""Look, a transfer must make sense now and in the long-term; we have midfielders, we have still enough midfielders. It is not that we lack midfielders, but it‚Äôs just some of them are injured.¬† ""This is not a good situation, I don‚Äôt like it at all, but we have to see how we react on that - but for sure not panicking.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-bad-is-liverpool-midfielder-thiago-s-injury/blt726bd9e1567bac05,Ewan Gennery,533f762c-e005-4f38-8675-35cd15419d2c
Blow for Leicester City as Nigeria star Ndidi ruled out for remainder of season,"Wilfred Ndidi will miss the rest of the 2021-22 campaign due to injury, Premier League side Leicester City have confirmed. The Nigeria international suffered a knee injury in the club‚Äôs 2-1 defeat to Rennes in a Europa Conference League clash ‚Äì and was subsequently replaced by James Maddison on the hour mark. That knock saw the 25-year-old ruled out of the just concluded 2022 Fifa World Cup playoff - where Nigeria failed against Ghana. Ahead of Saturday‚Äôs trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United, Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers disclosed the former Genk star will play no part in the remaining part of the current campaign. ‚ÄúWilfred Ndidi, unfortunately, will be out for the season, it‚Äôs a shame for us but he‚Äôll get ready for next season,‚Äù Rodgers told the media as per Leicester City website. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfortunate. He‚Äôs been a brilliant player for me in my time here. He picked up a nasty injury that he's had to have surgery on and he‚Äôll recover now until June.‚Äù Ndidi has been a consistent performer since teaming up with the club from the Belgians. In his absence, Senegal international Papy Mendy - who had been shut out of Leicester‚Äôs starting XI due to Ndidi‚Äôs blistering form will now be looked upon for inspiration alongside Cote d‚ÄôIvoire prospect Wesley Fofana. ""On the other side, Papy Mendy has come in and done great, and been very unfortunate,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe thought he was leaving in the summer, he wasn't in the squad, and didn't hardly play virtually for the first half of the season, apart from international games. ""He's done great for Senegal, he's come back, but he's always been a brilliant professional, so we gain a player in him and he's done very, very well since he's come back into the squad. ‚ÄúThe players are starting to come back now which is great. Jonny Evans will be available, whether he plays the whole game, or not, or starts or comes off the bench we‚Äôll see. ¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to have him back, he had 60 plus minutes for the international team and looks very, very good, so we‚Äôll have to build him up. Wesley Fofana will be back involved as well. We‚Äôre starting to get players back.‚Äù As things stand, City are 10th in the Premier League log having accrued 36 points from 27 matches. Victory over the Red Devils will see them move up the log in their quest to secure a place in Europe next season.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/blow-for-leicester-city-as-nigeria-star-ndidi-ruled-out-for/bltbd9c3387817bcf7f,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,5d10d112-84a8-4145-b6c1-54d34f45eeba

Why are 600 Chelsea fans in Middlesbrough's stadium despite ticket sales ban?,"In spite of the ban on ticket sales, a few hundred Chelsea fans did manage to make it up to Middlesbrough for Saturday's FA Cup clash. The Blues are playing for a spot in the competition's semi-finals against their Championship opponent at the Riverside Stadium. But the tie has been overshadowed by issues caused by the restrictions placed on the club and owner Roman Abramovich in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. During the week, Chelsea released a statement in which it was confirmed that no tickets would be made available for sale at the Riverside. The Blues even requested the game be played behind closed doors; a suggestion that met with a withering response from their opponents. Chelsea's 600 strong away end pic.twitter.com/hm5SjOjMxm So why, then, was a small contingent of Chelsea fans present for Saturday's game? Simply enough, because they managed to purchase the tickets before the Londoners were obliged to send them back. Chelsea's ticket restrictions do not apply to season ticket holders, who are still able to attend matches as before. But for the rest of the fanbase, and for away games, no end is in sight, though the Blues insist they are doing all they can to lift the ban. ""We are pressing the Government to allow our supporters to have access to tickets,"" a club statement explained on Monday. ""Meetings are taking place daily in search of a resolution. In addition, the Premier League and FA are also discussing with the Government the sporting integrity issues raised if they do not permit fans to attend. ""We are aware of the high level of frustration our supporters are facing over this issue, and we are doing everything we can to resolve it as soon as possible."" Away from the stands, Chelsea are also engaged in a takeover process, as Abramovich seeks to cut his ties with the side following the freezing of his United Kingdom-based assets. The deadline for new bids passed on Friday, with some 30 potential buyers submitting their proposals, and a shortlist of three or four final candidates is expected to be ready by Monday - with the club hoping that a takeover can be completed by the end of the current month.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-are-600-chelsea-fans-in-middlesbrough-s-stadium-despite/bltb54c151835b66b71,Daniel Edwards,4241ae42-2142-43c5-814d-b8c2ddca9e05
"Liverpool hero Tsimikas: I'm not the Greek Scouser, I'm the Scouser Greek","Konstantinos Tsimikas insisted ""I am not the Greek Scouser, I am the Scouser Greek"" after scoring the winning penalty for Liverpool in their shootout victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup final. The Reds lifted the FA Cup for the first time since 2006 after a dramatic contest against the Blues at Wembley on Saturday, which ended up going exactly the same way as the Carabao Cup final did earlier this season. Tsimikas came on as an extra-time substitute for the injured Andrew Robertson, and the full-back went on to seal the win for Jurgen Klopp's side with a well-taken spot-kick. Tsimikas' strike gave Liverpool a 6-5 win triumph in the shootout, after Mason Mount missed Chelsea's seventh penalty, and he wheeled away in celebration before being mobbed by his team-mates. The Greece international has only started 18 games for the Reds in 2021-22, but he said he feels like an honorary Scouser after his moment of glory at Wembley. ""We gave it absolutely everything. Big congratulations to the boys. We have to celebrate hard. But tomorrow is the next day, we still have a lot to do,"" Tsimikas told BBC Two. We have the games in the Premier League and we have the big final.  ""It's very, very special for me. The manager asked me which number I want. I say number seven. He asks me why so far? I say I want number seven.  ""And number seven gave me the opportunity to win the game. I choose the right side and I score. And I am very happy with that.  ""We want to win. Our goal from the start of the season was to go for it, hopefully at the end we are happy. I am not the 'Greek Scouser', I am the 'Scouser Greek'.  ""We have to celebrate now, but still in our minds we have the upcoming games. We have to be 100% focused if we want to achieve our goals."" Liverpool are still on track to become the first English club to ever win all four major trophies on offer after beating Chelsea, with their attention now set to switch back to the Premier League. Klopp's men will conclude their top-flight campaign with games against Southampton and Wolves, which they are likely to need to win to have any hope of catching Manchester City, who are currently three points clear at the top. A Champions League final date is also looming large on the horizon for Liverpool, with Real Madrid the only side left standing in their way of an eighth European cup success.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-hero-tsimikas-greek-scouser/blt6874abd688b56afb,James Westwood,ccb4f01e-b302-45fe-ba2b-a5cff779d984
Chelsea want Sterling transfer as Lukaku loan could open room for Man City forward,"Chelsea are targeting the summer transfer signing of Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling with simultaneous talks to offload Romelu Lukaku still ongoing, GOAL understands.¬† Inter have offered a fee of up to ¬£6 million to the Blues, but Thomas Tuchel's organisation are demanding more for the striker as they look to create more financial space for a signing such as Sterling, who only has one year left on his deal with the Premier League champions.¬† Chelsea are ready to compromise and let Lukaku go for around a ¬£10m ($12m) loan fee - far less than they initially requested. Reports in Italy have suggested that the England international could cost as little as ¬£35m ($43m) this summer which would be well within the west London club's budget.¬† Man City have failed in a bid to renew Sterling's deal amid concerns about his status within a squad with so many other high-profile attackers.¬† Chelsea have long held an interest in Sterling, who is open to moving abroad should a move to his home city London not materialise.¬† There are concerns that City could make life difficult in negotiations for a rival like Chelsea, though Gabriel Jesus was previously offered to Thomas Tuchel's side and is now in concrete talks with Arsenal.¬† Chelsea are in more active negotiations to sign Sevilla's Jules Kounde, who has broadly agreed on personal terms. However, there remains work to do on agreeing on a transfer fee.¬† Kounde is also attracting interest from Barcelona but they're currently paralysed from offering anything concrete due to financial issues.¬† The France international has had surgery on a minor hip issue and is hoping his future is resolved in the coming weeks ahead of pre-season.¬† Chelsea are also in talks with Chicago Fire's 18-year-old goalkeeping sensation Gabriel Slonina, who will likely go back on loan until the end of the season if he signs.¬† Meanwhile, the Blues have targets in other areas of the pitch depending on player sales which include, as GOAL first revealed, Brighton's Marc Cucurella.¬† There's also long-term interest in West Ham's Declan Rice with other central defenders being targeted like RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol, Atletico Madrid's Jose Gimenez and Paris Saint-Germain's Presnel Kimpembe.¬† The Blues have also tried to leverage Inter's interest in Lukaku to swap him for Lautaro Martinez, Denzel Dumfries, Milan Skriniar and Alessandro Bastoni. They've seen their requests for these players rejected out of hand, though. Barcelona are attempting to sign Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso but currently have no funds to make those moves happen. Chelsea are open to sales of other attackers like Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner but no moves seem imminent.¬† They also have to resolve the future of both N'Golo Kante and Jorginho heading into the final years of their contracts. Tuchel is open to letting Kepa Arrizabalaga go with loanees vying for his and any other spots that open up in the squad over pre-season.

Mbappe and Neymar pose with Beckham for photo during PSG trip to Qatar,"Kylian Mbappe has been spotted posing for pictures with Paris Saint-Germain team-mate Neymar and former player David Beckham in Qatar, as the France forward's decision on his future draws near. The attacker is in the Gulf State with the Ligue 1 outfit as part of their end-of-season schedule, despite speculation that his days with the Parc des Princes outfit are numbered ahead of a switch to Real Madrid. Nevertheless, Mbappe - who revealed his future would be announced before he begins France duty next month - was all smiles with Neymar, another PSG player linked with a move, and England legend Beckham, himself a former Blancos star. In a post on Instagram on Tuesday, the striker showed a snap of him, Neymar and Beckham smiling together in the nation's capital of Doha. A secondary shot showed him, Beckham and team-mate Achraf Hakimi laughing together in a stadium. Mbappe did not elaborate in his comments on the picture, merely including the national flag of Qatar alongside PSG's red-and-blue club colours. The story of Mbappe's next steps has been the biggest transfer saga of the season, after PSG refused to sell him to Madrid last term heading into the final year of his contract. The forward now looks set to depart Parc des Princes and move to Santiago Bernabeu, with terms reportedly agreed between player and club. Liverpool have also kept tabs on him, while a last-gasp renewed offer from PSG themselves looks to have fallen short.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-neymar-beckham-photo-psg-qatar/blt1fd9686e2ecaf5d4,Andrew Steel,3b7c9600-2047-44d9-a5e9-322385acea80
