Explained: How Chelsea are affected by Abramovich sanctions,"Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned by the United Kingdom Government, which will freeze his overseas assets, including Chelsea Football Club. On March 10, it was announced that Chelsea owner Abramovich, alongside six other high net-worth Russians, would be issued with an asset freeze and travel ban. Chelsea are now in an unprecedented period of uncertainty as the running of the club becomes directly linked to geopolitics.¬† Chelsea can still be sold provided the sale does not benefit Abramovich or the Russian Federation, and the club are in discussions with the government about next steps.¬† A statement from the UK government reads: ""While the current licence does not permit the sale of the club at this time, the Government is open to a sale of the club and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale. ""Proceeds from any sale could not go to the sanctioned individual while he is subject to sanctions."" At least 20 buyers had been previously ready to purchase Chelsea. Chelsea can continue to play matches under a special 'Russia Regulations' licence which also allows their 1,400 staff - including players - to be paid. The upcoming Thursday evening kick-off against Norwich in the Premier League will go ahead, but only season ticket holders will be allowed to attend home games with further ticket sales barred. The Blues are not allowed to sign any new players due to the terms of their licence. It effectively places another transfer ban on the European and world champions, with the club having already endured one just three years ago. Although Chelsea are banned from making transfers, they can move money in and out of other clubs for outstanding payments related to deals done before the sanctions were imposed on March 10.¬† Read more about how it will affect Chelsea's transfer plans Chelsea cannot continue their efforts to renew the contracts of their players, with expiring deals like Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen having been previously high on their agenda. Their deals run out in the summer, as do the contracts of several talented youth players, including Xavier Simons. It could force the club to hold onto all players currently under contract, due to their inability to bring players in, should the issue not be resolved in the near future. Chelsea's main shirt sponsor, 3, is known to be reviewing its deal with Chelsea.  ‚ÄúSanctions placed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich by the UK Government casts a shadow over Chelsea‚Äôs many commercial agreements, including its $52.5 million (¬£40m) front-of-shirt deal with Telecom‚Äôs brand 3, and its $72m (¬£55m) kit deal with Nike,‚Äù says Conrad Wiacek, Head of Sport Analysis at GloblalData, a leading data and analytics company.¬† ‚ÄúWhile Chelsea has a sporting licence to continue trading as a soccer club, many brands will be wary of guilt by association.¬† ‚ÄúChelsea FC is still one of the biggest clubs in the world and its on-field success still makes it an attractive commercial partner. However, given the rate at which many brands are looking to dissociate themselves from the Russian state, some may be wary of continuing partnerships.¬† ‚ÄúNike‚Äôs deal with Chelsea runs until 2032, so the apparel brand may decide to wait the situation out until the club‚Äôs sale is able to continue. However, brands such as Hyundai and Hublot, which have deals worth over $20m (¬£15m) combined expiring at the end of 2021-22 season, may not have that luxury.‚Äù Chelsea will be allowed to spend some money on staging matches at Stamford Bridge and in travelling to away matches. A spending limit of just ¬£20,000, however, applies to travel to away games, and could cause issues with preparations for Champions League fixtures in particular. The club will also  have to prove that such costs are 'reasonable costs'. Chelsea are also barred from receiving any revenue from merchandising sales, but will be allowed to take revenue from broadcasting matches. Abramovich is said to be worth ¬£9 billion ($12bn) and valued Chelsea at ¬£3bn ($4bn) during his negotiations to sell the club.¬† It is currently unclear if or when the sanctions will be lifted. It relates directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin's activity and the invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions will be reviewed in May, but there are further risks of a nine-point deduction should Chelsea go into administration.¬† In the statement released by the UK Government, it describes Abramovich as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch who has been involved in destabilising Ukraine."" He is further described as having a ""close relationship with Putin"" and providing steel for tanks in Russia's offensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated in his government's release: ""There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin‚Äôs vicious assault on Ukraine. ""Today‚Äôs sanctions are the latest step in the UK‚Äôs unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/explained-how-chelsea-affected-abramovich-sanctions/bltde22a5b972876413,Nizaar Kinsella,622961eb-5915-4d29-b470-ee727e69d0b2

"Chelsea owner Abramovich 'terrified of sanctions & is selling London properties', claims Labour MP Chris Bryant","Roman Abramovich is ""terrified"" of facing sanctions from the British government over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, claims Labour MP Chris Bryant, who suggests that the Chelsea owner is currently selling off his properties around London. The Blues supremo, a frequently linked ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has come under increasing pressure over the past week following Moscow's attack upon their neighbouring Eastern European nation. The 55-year-old has already issued a statement indicating the transition of responsibilities at Chelsea to other members of the club, but now opposition MP Bryant has suggested that he is attempting to evade potential sanctions, while criticising the government for their failure to act faster. ""The government has said that it wants, quite rightly, to sanction DUMA members, and it wants to sanction members of the Russian Federation council, but has not been able to do so yet,"" Bryant addressed the House of Commons during a session on Tuesday. ""Alisher Usmanov has already been sanctioned by the EU, but not yet by the UK, but I suspect that he will be pretty soon on a UK list, and Everton should certainly be cutting ties with him already. ""Roman Abramovich, well, I think he's terrified of being sanctioned which is why he is already going to sell his home tomorrow and sell another flat as well. My anxiety is that we're taking too long about these things. The Government is taking too long to introduce sanctions. pic.twitter.com/f9yugGVAnB ""Now, I have a suggestion on what might help. I fear that the government is frightened of letters, lawyers' letters from all these oligarchs' friends. One way to circumvent that is if ministers just read them to the record, in a proceeding in Parliament all the sanction criteria, and then they'd be protected."" As one of the most high-profile Russian figures on British shores, Abramovich could face any number of the sweeping - though not all-inclusive - sanctions laid out by the Conservative Govenment under Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Asset freezes have already been ordered on a number of individuals, as well as major Russian banks, while potential deposits by those foreign nationals will be capped, as the Ukraine-Russia crisis continues to unfold. Such sanctions could prove difficult for Abramovich to avoid, but could also spell trouble for Chelsea's own financial situation too. While their owner remains mired in the fallout of last month's invasion, Chelsea will look to bounce back from the heartbreak of Sunday's Carabao Cup final loss to Liverpool in the FA Cup this week. The incumbent Champions League and Club World Cup holders face Championship outfit Luton Town for a place in the quarter-finals. After that, they will return their attention to both the Premier League, with a game against relegation-threatened Burnley at the weekend.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-owner-abramovich-terrified-of-sanctions-and-is/blt65b817648df68ca2,Andrew Steel,e08773d8-6a7e-4a0a-8746-ed8677f4d1fc

Mwepu prays for injury-free season with Brighton & Hove Albion in Premier League,"Zambia international Enock Mwepu is hoping to head into the new Premier League season with Brighton & Hove Albion without injuries. The 24-year-old Chipolopolo captain moved to the Seagulls from Austrian club RB Salzburg at the start of the new season but it has been a testing debut season as he has twice suffered injuries that have kept him out of several matches. With two matches left this season for Brighton - against Leeds United and West Ham United - Mwepu has already been ruled out of the season after picking a groin injury in the team‚Äôs 3-0 defeat against Manchester City on April 20. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy to come to a new country, with a new language and the weather is not so good,‚Äù Mwepu told BBC Radio Sussex as quoted by BBC Sports Africa. ‚ÄúMy family have always been supporting me so I am really grateful to them.  ""The fans have made it even easier with the support they have given me this season. They have been phenomenal and I have so much I owe them. ‚ÄúI can only pray that next season I am fit to be consistent the whole season. You never know what I can achieve. I want to be an important player for the team so that is my goal.‚Äù Mwepu, who managed 17 appearances, scored two goals, and chipped in with five assists, has also explained his relationship with Brighton manager Graham Potter. ‚ÄúGraham [Potter] has been a good gaffer for me,‚Äù Mwepu continued. ‚ÄúHe is always telling me what I did in a game, what I need to improve, and how important I am in the team. That means a lot to me. ‚ÄúHe is like a father and a teacher for me. I have learnt so many things this season. I am trying to work on my physicality and speed as the tempo and quality of players is quite high in the Premier League.‚Äù On Monday, Mwepu‚Äôs goal against Liverpool in the 2-2 draw at Anfield was voted the Goal of the Season by Brighton fans and the attacker has moved to thank the fans for the gesture. ‚ÄúI have seen incredible goals all season from the guys,‚Äù added Mwepu. ‚ÄúThanks to everyone who voted. It is a goal which will always be special to me and it is my highlight of the season.‚Äù It was against Arsenal on April 9 when Mwepu scored his second goal in the 2-1 victory at Emirates Stadium. Last season, Mwepu played 29 Bundesliga games for Salzburg, scoring five goals and providing one assist.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mwepu-prays-for-injury-free-season-with-brighton-and-hove-albion-/blt12a9fec0320b8787,Dennis Mabuka,220220af-05c0-44a4-a723-5559376a3fa4
'We know how good we are' - Will Sweden end England's Women's Euros hopes?,"Magdalena Eriksson, the Sweden defender and Chelsea captain, was speaking to the press about her nation‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Euro semi-final opponent, England. Next to her was Kosovare Asllani ‚Äì the team‚Äôs No.9 by shirt, but No.10 by nature. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve looked stable and worked well defensively,‚Äù Eriksson said before glancing at her team-mate with a smile. ‚ÄúBut maybe Kosovare can open it up a little bit. You never know.‚Äù Before all the talk of ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs coming home‚Äô, Sweden was the nation tipped by many to win this Euros. Last summer, they were outstanding at the Olympics Games, losing only on penalties in the final. In 2019, they reached the last four of the World Cup, eliminated in extra-time before beating England to third place. After constant improvement through each experience, they occupied a large amount of the pre-tournament talk ‚Äì and rightly so. This is a balanced, consistent and well-coached team. It has all the ingredients to win the title. ‚ÄúWe know how good we are,‚Äù Fridolina Rolfo, the Barcelona star, said when asked by GOAL about that hype. ‚ÄúWe know what it feels like to lose games and we know we don't want to have that feeling again. But also, we are even better now. ‚ÄúWe have a really good defence. We have many fast players, so we can use counterattacks to score goals. We are strong on set-pieces, too.  ""Maybe we have more technical players now [compared to last summer] ‚Äì skilful, with fast movement. I think perhaps that is something we have added to the squad.‚Äù They are yet to set the Euros alight but got better with each game in the group stages, sealing top spot ahead of the reigning champions, the Netherlands, with a 5-0 win over Portugal. That set-up a quarter-final tie with Belgium that many expected them to cruise through, but their opponents were tough and while England fans watching the eventual 1-0 win may have concluded there was nothing for the Lionesses to worry about, there was important context to note. In the build-up to the game, Sweden lost Hanna Glas and Emma Kullberg to Covid-19, with Jonna Andersson another confirmed case on the day. The former and the latter are their two first-choice full-backs and their absences were felt massively, with the team struggling for joy out wide. It was Linda Sembrant‚Äôs stoppage-time winner that secured passage to the semi-finals. The 35-year-old only played nine league games all season due to injury, but she came up big on her first start of the summer. ‚ÄúHolding a clean sheet with a newly-composed backline, with players who haven‚Äôt played a lot in this tournament, who haven‚Äôt had the best way to prepare, like Linda who has been injured ‚Äì I‚Äôm really, really impressed with how those players stepped up,‚Äù Eriksson said after. It summed up a real strength of Sweden's ‚Äì depth.  It was on show in the group stages, too, particularly when Hanna Bennison, the 19-year-old named GOAL‚Äôs NXGN winner last year, came off the bench to score a late winner against Switzerland that would help secure first place. It was her first international goal. #NXGN 2021 winner Hanna Bennison with a stunning winner for Sweden at #EURO2022 https://t.co/3jsg9Nrsck That squad strength has been needed with the Covid cases and an injury to captain Caroline Seger, who holds things together in midfield. In addition, star striker Stina Blackstenius started the tournament with a knock. The unity of the group is important in that sense, too. ‚Äú[We‚Äôre] a team that will do everything [we] can to win a game,‚Äù Eriksson added. ‚ÄúWe never give up, we always fight, we run for each other, we work really, really hard.‚Äù Sweden will be facing a stronger team than Belgium this time, but the general consensus among the players is that it will be a game that suits them more. While their quarter-final opponents sat deep and defended in a block, England will want to dominate. ‚ÄúIt will be a totally different game. I think they will attack and be more offensive and I think that's good for us,‚Äù Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, the winger who has formed a potent partnership on the right with Glas, who will return for the semi-final, told GOAL. Gerhardsson has options with pace, quick feet and good decision-making. He also has one of the stand-out playmakers on the planet, in Asllani, who has been one of the best players in England this summer. They will have to defend more and nullify the incredibly dangerous and talented players the hosts have, too, but, as Rolfo says, that‚Äôs one thing this team excels at. They also have the ability to press high, which England did not enjoy against Austria in their opening fixture. ""Stina Blackstenius is one of our best defenders,‚Äù Gerhardsson explained. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs tactically very clever and works very hard. I have clips from the Olympics where she chases four or five players and wins the ball. ‚ÄúKosovare Asllani is also one of our best. She has such good awareness of the game play. She‚Äôs incredibly good in the defensive work. They‚Äôre very good in a high press."" ‚ÄòEven against England?‚Äô one journalist asked. ""Even against the United States in the Olympics,‚Äù Gerhardsson responded. ‚ÄúEven against England in the World Cup in 2019."" After coming so close to glory in recent years, Sweden are hungry. There has been so much talk about them, but on Tuesday, the pressure will be off.  It‚Äôll all move onto the team on the other side of the pitch, who will be buoyed by a vocal home crowd ‚Äì but an expectant one. England know they‚Äôve been good. They know they have what it takes to finally turn a major tournament semi-final ‚Äì their fourth in a row ‚Äì into a final. But their opponent is certainly capable of stopping them. ‚ÄúWe want to win the tournament,‚Äù said Rolfo. ‚ÄúBut we know we have to work.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/women-euros-sweden-england-semi-final/bltae7d25f645c9ac5e,Ame√© Ruszkai,41e3ae1e-c8ea-4e6e-896c-f8b73ab1cda8
'Tuchel opened my eyes' - Mainz boss Svensson praises Chelsea manager's influence,"Mainz coach Bo Svensson has explained how Thomas Tuchel influenced his career and said the Chelsea boss proved to be his inspiration to get into management. Tuchel managed Mainz from 2009 to 2014, with Svensson featuring for the club for the entirety of the German coach's tenure. Svensson took over as coach of his former club in 2021, leading them to a surprising eighth-place finish in the Bundesliga last season, as he now looks to do what Tuchel did before him by establishing Mainz as a regular in the top half of the table. ""It was a defining period for me as a coach, for my coaching career,"" Svensson said of the five years he spent under Tuchel. ""They were also defining years for me as a person because Thomas was just a different coach than everyone that I had before. He just saw the game in a different way. ""He trained in a different way and his whole approach was very ambitious but also just very innovative and that opened my eyes to a lot of things. ""Of course, he was the guy who opened my eyes and got me interested in the whole coaching thing, so that's a lot of inspiration."" Despite their similar paths that saw them both coach at the youth level before taking over Mainz, Svensson says he prefers not to compare himself with his former mentor, who has accomplished so much more as a coach. ""I think everybody who meets inspirational people in their life, they will take something from them and I've done the same,"" he said. ""Maybe you can take something from examples like training exercises or ways to approach a game or something.  ""Of course, I've been influenced by that but I think it was also that's why it was also important for me to go through the whole youth academy and having these youth themes because you when you go as a player into the coaching role, you have no idea what it's actually about. ""I've taken a lot from Thomas but I think I've I've also justified along the way, or am still defining, how I want to be and what matters for me, without looking to how Thomas maybe would have found the solution or anything."" Tuchel is not the only coach to have made his name at Mainz, as Jurgen Klopp built his reputation at the club before joining Borussia Dortmund. Jan Siewert, Mainz's academy director, followed Klopp and Tuchel's path from Dortmund's reserves to the big time, eventually taking over from David Wagner for an ill-fated stint at Huddersfield. Siewert, like all German coaches, was compared to Tuchel and Klopp, and he says that the comparisons are welcome. ""If it was a burden, it depends on each personality,"" he said. ""The question is how you deal with the burdens.  ""I think it makes us all more proud having such exceptional coaches in the best league of the world and as well winning in the Champions League or other titles."" After overachieving last season, Mainz are looking at the possibility of losing some key players. Chief among them is captain Moussa Niakhate, who has drawn interest from several Premier League clubs as he enters the final year of his deal. For a club like Mainz, losing players is just a fact of life, and their coach says they're prepared for when and if bigger clubs come in to snatch their stars. ""That's the downside of performing and performing well,"" Svensson said. ""We know that we have clubs that have more money than us and will look at players that were doing well at Mainz because that's just natural.  ""That's where we are in the food chain, so what we can do about it is we can prepare ourselves as well as possible, keep an eye out on players who could be interesting to replace Moussa or replace some of the other players just to strengthen our own team and be as well as prepared as we as we possibly can.  ""It's too bad that we cannot go on and just with the same players year after year, but we're not the only team who have this challenge and it's also the normal way of things that you have to be able to adjust and think ahead so we've been well prepared for things that would happen this summer.  ""In the football world things are unpredictable, So sometimes you just have to accept things, sometimes some things you can plan for, and other things you have to be flexible and accept that you are where you are.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-mainz-boss-svensson-chelsea-influence/blt1053802143dceff1,Ryan Tolmich,6092e525-7a87-4241-81f6-2c5d89d2fa1e
Haaland tipped to tear ‚Äògreat‚Äô Premier League defenders apart after ¬£51m Man City transfer as Flo sounds warning,"Erling Haaland is ready to tear ‚Äúa lot of great defenders in England‚Äù apart, claims fellow countryman Tore Andre Flo, with Manchester City expected to enjoy an immediate return on a ¬£51 million ($61m) investment in a ‚Äúperfect fit‚Äù for their system. Pep Guardiola has often fielded sides without a central striker during his reign at the Etihad Stadium, but another prolific No.9 has been added to his ranks ahead of the 2022-23 campaign. Haaland‚Äôs arrival appears to have made the Premier League champions even stronger, on the back of four title triumphs in the space of five years, and Flo believes a highly-rated 21-year-old will have opponents running scared in the English top-flight. Former Chelsea frontman Flo, who won 76 caps for Norway in his playing days, has told The Sun of the impact Haaland can make with City: ‚ÄúNo matter how big the game or how much pressure, he has coped. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of great defenders in England ‚Äî but even they will find it very hard to stop him.‚Äù Erling Haaland will wear number 9 for Manchester City üîµ pic.twitter.com/5jshJM9IUx He added: ‚ÄúWhen people talk of having a striker‚Äôs instinct, that‚Äôs one thing, but to combine it with his quality is not something you see very often. ‚ÄúOf course there will be a lot of pressure on him at City ‚Äî but don‚Äôt forget he will be playing with a lot more quality around him as well. It just seems to be the perfect fit for both. ‚ÄúWith the type of players he‚Äôll be playing with and the way he scores his goals, they just really look made for each other. ‚ÄúCity put a lot of low balls to the far post and, if you‚Äôre a natural goalscorer, that‚Äôs what you dream of. He will get on the end of so many of them. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so sharp at getting in front of defenders, first to so many crosses. High or low, he doesn‚Äôt care, he just gets on the end of them and usually scores ‚Äî he really strikes the ball so cleanly.‚Äù Guardiola is going to have to tinker with his tactical plans slightly in order to incorporate Haaland, but manager and player are considered to be wise enough to make a potentially devastating partnership work. A highly-rated forward has endured his fair share of injury problems in recent times, but the hope is that those have been left in the past while a timely break from domestic action will be enjoyed when the World Cup finals ‚Äì without Norway being involved ‚Äì are taken in between November 21 and December 18. Flo sees benefits to that, adding: ‚ÄúMissing out on the finals is obviously a massive disappointment to Erling, but that could be a huge advantage to City. ‚ÄúIt gives him an extra month or so to get to know his new club and to work with boss Pep Guardiola. And, of course, to be fitter and fresher than coming back from a very intense tournament.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-tear-great-premier-league-defenders-apart-51m-man/blt20ccc5e153c6bfd5,Chris Burton,176704a4-dde0-473c-9be2-2747750930b4
Liverpool's Fabinho: Luis Diaz didn't believe I would take a Panenka against Chelsea,"Fabinho has revealed how a conversation with Luis Diaz led to his ‚ÄòPanenka‚Äô penalty during Liverpool‚Äôs Carabao Cup final win over Chelsea. The Brazilian was the coolest man inside Wembley as the Reds‚Äô held their nerve to win a marathon shootout last month. Fabinho stepped up second, and clipped his spot-kick right down the middle, as Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper, dived to his right. Speaking at a press conference ahead of Liverpool‚Äôs Champions League last-16 second-leg clash with Inter Milan, Fabinho was asked about his ‚ÄòPanenka‚Äô, and where the inspiration for it had come from. He told reporters:¬†‚ÄúThe day before, I tried to do a Panenka. It was just me and Luis Diaz, with no goalkeeper in the goal. ‚ÄúI told him ‚Äòtomorrow if it goes to pens, I will shoot it like this‚Äô. He didn‚Äôt believe me! But when I was walking to the box to take the penalty, it was in my mind to shoot a Panenka.

Robertson fires 'scary' warning to Premier League rivals as he says Luis Diaz 'will get better',"Andy Robertson has warned Liverpool's Premier League and European rivals that a ""scary"" Luis Diaz will only ""get better"" with a full pre-season at the club, after his match-winning performance booked the Reds a third Champions League final in the space of five seasons. The Colombian was introduced at half-time in Tuesday's second leg against Villarreal, with Jurgen Klopp's visitors trailing 2-0 on the night and tying 2-2 on aggregate, to produce a sublime performance that steered his team to a 3-2 comeback victory against the Yellow Submarine. It is the latest superb turn from the winger, who has already won silverware with Carabao Cup success following his arrival in January and, after helping Liverpool to a first Champions League final since they beat Tottenham in 2019, his team-mate thinks he will only improve. ""He has been special,"" Robertson stated. ""We've tried to help him as much as we can, all the players. We know how difficult it is coming in in January. The coaches and everyone else have got him up to speed but he is a special, special player. The talent he has and the will to win - he just fits us perfectly. ""It was tough to take Jota off, I think he has been excellent this season, but Luis came on and made a big, big difference. He played on the left, started pushing them back, dribbling the ball and everything. A really good half from him. ""He's been special since he came in and it's been a pleasure to play with him. Hopefully he will only get better. With a full pre-season under his belt I believe he will get better, which is scary, but what he has produced in the here and now is pretty special as well."" Liverpool now await the confirmation of their opponent for their clash in Paris, with either a 2018 final rematch against Real Madrid or an all-English affair with Premier League rivals Manchester City looming on the horizon for the Reds. Robertson, however, was untroubled on whether it would be Pep Guardiola's side or Carlo Ancelotti's La Liga champions joining them, but pointed to their success against Spurs three years ago, adding: ""Time will tell. We won it in an all-English final. I think the English finals are always tough, you play them enough in a season. ""City are an incredible team and are in pole position; we will watch and Real Madrid will try to have a say in it. We can watch that game knowing we have done our job, knowing we are through and can look forward to the final whoever we play. Both of them will fight it out tonight.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/robertson-scary-warning-premier-league-rivals-luis-diaz/blt6ab813f8e535706a,Andrew Steel,8367b247-750b-4441-ab46-7f4933550724
USMNT defender Sands joins Rangers on loan from NYCFC,"U.S. men's national team player James Sands has officially joined Rangers on loan. Sands, who can play in both defence and midfield, will remain with Rangers on loan through 2023, with Rangers having the option to make the move permanent at the end of the loan. The move comes after Sands helped lead NYCFC to an MLS Cup triumph while also breaking through with the USMNT following an impressive run as this past summer's Gold Cup. Sands has spent the entirety of his young career with NYCFC, having signed with the club as a Homegrown player in 2017. The 21-year-old played a total of 69 matches for NYCFC, including 30 last season to earn an MLS All-Star selection while leading the club to an MLS Cup trophy. He's been capped seven times by the USMNT and figured to remain a part of the team for World Cup qualifying. In moving to Rangers, Sands joins a strong list of Americans to represent the club, joining former USMNT stars Claudio Reyna, Maurice Edu and Carlos Bocanegra. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited to be joining Rangers Football Club,"" Sands said in a statement.

Benzema? Modric? Marcelo speculates on who could break his record of 25 trophies at Real Madrid,"Marcelo has bid farewell at Real Madrid after 15 memorable years, with the long-serving Brazilian full-back saying he would be happy to see one of his former team-mates pass a record-setting haul of 25 trophies with the Blancos. The 34-year-old defender, who moved to Santiago Bernabeu from Fluminense in January 2007, is leaving the Liga heavyweights with 546 appearances to his name and a historic collection of major silverware. Another domestic title and Champions League crown were added to that haul in 2021-22 and Marcelo acknowledges that a few of those he is leaving behind in the Spanish capital could go on to better his achievements. Marcelo is leaving Real as a free agent at the end of his contract, with many happy memories allowing him to look back fondly on six La Liga title triumphs, five Champions League wins, two Copas del Rey, five Spanish Super Cups, three UEFA Super Cups and four FIFA Club World Cup successes. While his trophy collection stands at 25, there are members of Carlo Ancelotti‚Äôs current squad that are also into the 20s and may fancy their chances of raising a bar of individual excellence before their day comes to sever ties with Madrid. Marcelo said at his final press conference when asked about who could break his record: ‚ÄúIf they beat me, that will be a source of pride. [Karim] Benzema, Luka [Modric], Casemiro... whoever it is, I'm going to be very happy.‚Äù Marcelo's final Real Madrid trophy haul üëë pic.twitter.com/gFfz6XeAKg While he has no club for 2022-23 at present, Marcelo insists he will not be hanging up his boots and would have no problem facing Real in the future were their paths to cross again. He said of his future plans: ‚ÄúI'm going to continue playing, I think I can continue. And if I play for Madrid there's no problem. I‚Äôm a Madridista, but I'm also a professional.‚Äù Pressed on whether he would have liked to stay on at the Bernabeu for one more year, Marcelo added: ‚ÄúI don't feel like a legend. There's no problem leaving Madrid. Life doesn't end here. I don't leave saying ‚Äòdamn, I wanted one more year‚Äô. ‚ÄúI'll always cheer for Real Madrid and between us all we've decided to go out like this and through the front door, looking at everyone's face. I didn't want to continue another year or two out of pity.‚Äù His record for the Blancos will stand the test of time and suggests that he now sits above fellow countryman Roberto Carlos on a notable list of legendary left-backs at Real Madrid. Marcelo is, however, reluctant to compare himself with others ‚Äì particularly a World Cup-winning compatriot. He said of topping Roberto Carlos: ‚ÄúIt is very difficult to compare, because when you arrive at such a big club there are always great players. ‚ÄúThe journalists said that the replacement for Roberto Carlos was coming, but I wanted to be Marcelo. For me there has been no other like Roberto. He is the best in history.

'We can bring Man Utd back' - Rangnick expects top-quality players to join this summer while acknowledging impending departures,"Ralf Rangnick says ""quite a few players"" will depart Manchester United this summer as he hopes some ""top-quality"" stars come in ahead of next season. The Red Devils beat Brentford 3-0 on Monday in Rangnick's final home game as interim manager, with the German set to step into a consultancy role at Old Trafford next term. The 63-year-old is confident that United can improve quickly as they near the end of a disappointing campaign that will see them miss out on silverware and a place in next season's Champions League. Rangnick told Sky Sports: ""It's obvious quite a few players will leave and there is a need for top-quality players.  ""I strongly believe that if everyone works together we can bring Man Utd back to where we need to be.  ""Other clubs only needed two or three transfer windows to challenge but from now on we need to bring in top-quality players who really help raise the level.  ""If this happens then I don't think it should take too long."" Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic were two such players who will leave the club when their contracts expire at the end of the season. Mata, who has been with the club since 2014, put in a fine display in his final match at Old Trafford and the coach was pleased with the quality the pair added to the midfield. ""We played with Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic and that gave us some quality in midfield,"" Rangnick said.  ""It was not too easy for Brentford to take the ball away from us. In the first half we played too many square and back passes but in general it was a good performance.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-can-bring-man-utd-back-rangnick-expects-top-quality/blt4f9e14c4d53253e1,Peter McVitie,55b9eb43-0f84-43ab-9422-73198e25c0d4
Alexander-Arnold vs Vinicius: The tactical battle that will define the Champions League final,"A cursory glance at the predicted line-ups for Saturday‚Äôs Champions League final is all it takes to spot the game‚Äôs most important head-to-head, the battle for space and for supremacy that will likely define which of Liverpool or Real Madrid lifts the trophy in Paris. Vinicius Junior versus Trent Alexander-Arnold: the impossibly-quick left winger up against the right-back who can struggle defending one-on-ones. Liverpool‚Äôs crucial attacking weapon up against Real‚Äôs most important counterattacker. Neither is likely to pin the other, and neither is likely to fully succeed in their defensive mission. It is also the key battle that best represents the respective managers‚Äô tactical styles and the pattern that will emerge over the 90 minutes. Carlo Ancelotti, a hands-off tactician most skilled at finding balance amongst egos, has noted his team‚Äôs relative weakness in 2021-22 and sensibly decided on a purely counterattacking approach in the Champions League. Real sit right back, absorbing pressure for long periods before utilising the experience of their best players to break at just the right moments. This was most noticeable in the two legs against Paris Saint-Germain, when fear of Kylian Mbappe‚Äôs pace saw a particularly extreme example of remaining in a hunched formation that drew PSG forward ‚Äì limiting the French side‚Äôs capacity to play with speed. Consequently, it is safe to assume Real Madrid will again enact this system against Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs lethal front line, especially given that numerous opponents this season (including their most recent, Wolves) have shown that Liverpool‚Äôs high defensive line can look vulnerable. Vinicius is generally the target of these direct, long balls that are whipped in behind by Luka Modric or Toni Kroos as they pick up possession on the back of opposition midfielders. Much rests on Liverpool‚Äôs counter-press being strong enough to squeeze this space and prevent the pass. Should the ball get to Vinicius, Alexander-Arnold is unlikely to be in the right position to stop him. Instead, it will be left to the right-sided centre-back and the right central midfielder to shift across and cover. Fabinho is expected to return from injury just in time, meaning Jordan Henderson may perform the latter task effectively. However, Vinicius‚Äô threat is primarily the result of Karim Benzema‚Äôs brilliant work dropping off the front line to link play, particularly in explosive moments when Real Madrid make use of the attacking transition ‚Äì and particularly by leaning left to connect with Vinicius. Together, these two wreak havoc and Liverpool will be highly susceptible when Alexander-Arnold is caught ahead of the ball. As Benzema comes out to the left, dragging a centre-back with him, space tnds to open centrally for Vinicius to make central runs. This combination is a serious danger to Liverpool, and that‚Äôs before we get to the more obvious threat: a direct head-to-head in the dribble. That Vinicius x Benzema connection coming through again ‚ö°Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/PedLqQx47f There will be many occasions in this match when Liverpool are set in their defensive formation and Madrid, from a throw-in or a free-kick, are left to probe in the final third. Here, the straight fight clearly favours the faster player Vinicius.¬† The battle between Vinicius and Alexander-Arnold is just as critical at the other end. The Brazilian is a hard-working player but not exactly known for his defensive capabilities. In fact, Real are likely to defend in a 4-4-2 off the ball, with Federico Valverde dropping into the midfield line as Vinicius remains higher with Benzema. That is the plan, at least, but Ancelotti‚Äôs team won‚Äôt get their own way ‚Äì and Liverpool ought to be able to manipulate a battle between Alexander-Arnold and Vinicius that goes in their favour. Aware of the threat down Real‚Äôs left, Klopp may choose to attack predominantly down the opposite flank where Luis Diaz and Andrew Robertson will target Dani Carvajal. By doing so, Liverpool will drag the Real team across to that side of the pitch, forcing Valverde right out to the wing and pressuring Vinicius into dropping to form a 4-5-1 on the other side. From here, with one diagonal switch Liverpool can find Mohamed Salah one on one with Ferland Mendy and Alexander-Arnold supporting. Trent Alexander-Arnold has 18 assists in all competitions this season, the third most of any player in Europe‚Äôs big five leagues. pic.twitter.com/ny8pM0JqGy Vinicius will be scrambling to help in these moments, but he is highly unlikely to prevent the Liverpool right-back from swinging his trademark crosses into the box. This is the tactical situation most likely to occur across the first hour of the match, at least if Liverpool are at their best.  Klopp‚Äôs side are a lot stronger than Real and ought to win comfortably, pressing onto the Real midfield to stop the ball from getting to Vinicius in dangerous and exposing positions. But Ancelotti could make a substitution that flips the game‚Äôs key battle in Real Madrid‚Äôs favour. Eduardo Camavinga has come off the bench in each of Real‚Äôs last five Champions League matches and has made a telling impact in each one. His verticality flicks a switch as legs tire. The 19-year-old‚Äôs progressive passing and incisive dribbling tends to break games open, and after such an exhausting campaign Liverpool may tire in the middle of the park towards the end of the 90 minutes. Should that happen, Camavinga can take over the job of feeding Vinicius into the spaces behind Alexander-Arnold. Technically and tactically, Liverpool are the superior team. But Real Madrid are potentially smarter in these situations and perhaps fitter, too.¬† Klopp needs to make a fast start or risk the game slipping away from him. He needs Alexander-Arnold to take a decisive advantage in his crucial, title-deciding tussle with Vinicius Junior.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/alexander-arnold-vinicius-tactical-battle-define-champions/blt01a26e5324fffa3d,Alex Keble,3bc56687-c17e-4426-9664-e9050753227a
'Dybala or Lukaku? I can't decide' - Moratti on Inter's summer transfer plans,"Former Inter president Massimo Moratti says the Nerazzurri need to sign a striker this summer - but he cannot decide between Paulo Dybala and Romelu Lukaku. Dybala is set to leave Juventus on a free transfer when his contract expires at the end of the campaign while Lukaku, who scored 30 goals for Inter last season before re-joining Chelsea, could also be on the move after an inconsistent campaign at Stamford Bridge. Both have been linked with a switch to San Siro, with current Inter frontman Lautaro Martinez rumoured to be interesting rival clubs across Europe - most notably Arsenal and Tottenham. Speaking to Radio Uno about Inter‚Äôs potential summer plans, Moratti said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always sign Dybala, he is really strong. However, I believe Inter need a centre forward. If it‚Äôs not Lukaku, Inter will need a new one anyway. ‚ÄúLautaro is a promising striker who hasn‚Äôt yet made that extra step. He has all the means to do well. I hope he can do better in the next games. Edin Dzeko has done well also without him. Joaquin Correa is a smart striker.‚Äù Champions Inter were the only side in Serie A's top three to win last weekend, meaning they are just two points behind leaders Milan in second place with a game in hand. With the title race set to go to the wire, Milan boss Stefano Pioli called for fixtures involving the challengers to be played at the same time to make things fair - something Moratti agrees with. The 76-year-old also warned his old side not to discount fourth-placed Juventus, who are just six points behind the leaders. ""It would be more interesting and fair,‚Äù Moratti said of Pioli's proposal. ""Everything changes every weekend, Inter made the right step and were really convincing against Verona. A few games are remaining and there is no more room for mistakes. Games against the so-called smaller teams are those that make me more worried.

Ikpeba believes Manchester United's Ronaldo signing was mistake and he should leave,"Ex-Nigeria international Victor Ikpeba believes the return of Cristiano Ronaldo to Premier League side Manchester United was a mistake. The Portugal international made a return to Old Trafford at the beginning of the season in an effort by the Red Devils management to boost their attack.  The 37-year-old has managed to score 22 goals for the club in all competitions, but Manchester United are out of the race to win any silverware this season and are struggling to finish in the Champions League places. Current Ajax boss Erik ten Hag has been appointed as the new manager for the Manchester club and Ikpeba believes Ronaldo should be on his way out come next season. ""I think he should be leaving the club. Ronaldo coming back to Manchester United was a mistake,"" the 48-year-old said on SuperSport's Monday Night Football.¬† ""It is not a question of him scoring goals, so many things happen when a star player returns to his original club.  ""In many ways, Ronaldo has been a distraction. He's a global star in football, he shouldn't have come back at that age, he should have gone to Manchester City. ""Egocentric players, jealousy comes to play in the dressing room. The atmosphere has been nasty right from the beginning."" Ronaldo's first stint with Manchester United was between 2003 and 2009 when he scored 118 goals in 292 matches. He then left for Real Madrid from the 2009/10 season until 2018/19 and opted to join Italian heavyweights Juventus until last season. Despite his crucial goals for the club, things have not gone as projected and the team is currently sixth on the table with 54 points having played 34 games, one more than fourth-placed Arsenal (60) and Tottenham Hotspur - who are fifth having collected 58 points.

Ronaldo tells Man Utd he wants transfer - why CR7 wants out & where he could go,"Cristiano Ronaldo has asked to leave Manchester United, GOAL can confirm. The Portuguese legend has informed Old Trafford‚Äôs hierarchy he wants to leave just a year after his sensational return to the club, and has outlined specific reasoning for his request. Sources also believe agent Jorge Mendes may already have a buyer lined up. Ronaldo is determined to carry on playing in the Champions League as he nears the end of his career, and United‚Äôs failure to secure a top four finish last season has convinced him he needs to find a club where he can compete for top honours again. The 37-year-old has requested United allow him to leave provided they receive an acceptable offer this summer. United cannot afford to lose Ronaldo without a top class replacement. Top strike target was Nunez - and they didn‚Äôt fancy that sort of money, given other transfer requirements. Lack of and cost alternatives is a massive problem this window #mufc The former Real Madrid and Juventus striker has informed United that he does not believe they will be able to mount a realistic title challenge this season ‚Äì and also has concerns over their ability finish in the top four. With the Portugal international in the twilight of his career, he is adamant he wants to carry on playing at the highest level of the game and does not want to miss out on the Champions League for even one season. The appointment of Erik ten Hag has not managed to convince him to be part of the Dutchman‚Äôs intended overhaul. Mendes is said to have already been sounding out potential buyers, with Bayern Munich and Chelsea linked. A return to Serie A has also been reported by Italian media.

Ten Hag planned on Ronaldo leading his attack in his first season at the club, before looking for another centre-forward next summer. United‚Äôs priority is central midfield, with Ten Hag closing in on a deal for top target Frenkie de Jong, while an offer has also been made to out-of-contract Christian Eriksen.

Pulisic 'not happy' with amount of USMNT fans in attendance for win over Morocco,"Christian Pulisic said he was unhappy with the amount of U.S. men's national team fans in the stadium for Wednesday's clash with Morocco.

Roughly 20,000 fans were in attendance at the 26,000-seat stadium, with there being a decent amount of Morocco supporters scattered throughout the crowd. Pulisic created two of the USMNT's two goals, assisting Brenden Aaronson on the USMNT's first before drawing a penalty for the third, which was converted by Haji Wright. But, after the match, he admitted his frustration with the crowd support as he expected more American fans in the building so close to the World Cup.

"Martinez: When Messi speaks, even Argentina's president has to shut up!","Argentinian goalkeeper Emi Martinez says that, when Lionel Messi talks, even the president of Argentina has to stay quiet and listen as he detailed the Paris Saint-Germain star's speech on the day of the country's Copa America triumph.

"Watford vs Norwich City: Predictions, odds & betting tips","This article contains affiliate links. We may receive a commission on any sales we generate from it A relegation six-pointer will take place at Vicarage Road on Friday, as Watford take on Norwich City in the Premier League. The Hornets are just a point ahead of their opponents in 17th place, although do have two games in hand going into this clash. Having run out 3-1 winners in September‚Äôs reverse encounter at Carrow Road, Watford are 21/20 (2.05) favourites with bet365 to increase their cushion above the relegation zone with another victory. Dean Smith‚Äôs men brought an end to their six-match league losing streak by beating Everton 2-1 last weekend and Norwich are available at 13/5 (3.60) to record back-to-back wins here. None of the last nine meetings between this pair has resulted in a draw, but you can get odds of 12/5 (3.40) on them cancelling each other out in this one. Josh King is the 5/1 (6.0) favourite to open the scoring with his first goal since November, although Emmanuel Dennis looks a better bet at 13/2 (7.50) following goals in six of his last 10 appearances. Teemu Pukki is the visitors' 6/1 (7.0) favourite to break the deadlock after scoring five of his side‚Äôs 10 league goals so far, while Adam Idah can be backed at 8/1 (9.0) following his first goal of the campaign against Everton. Claudio Ranieri‚Äôs team have produced plenty of late action recently, with each of their last five fixtures featuring goals after the 84th minute. There could be more of the same in this clash considering both teams will be determined to avoid defeat, with defences set to sit deep and force the opposition to work hard for a breakthrough. What‚Äôs more, the Canaries have also seen goals scored from the 75th minute onwards in seven of their previous nine fixtures, making another slow burner seem even more likely here. With this in mind, odds of 5/6 (1.83) look well worth backing on a goal being scored in the final 15 minutes of the game when Watford take on Norwich. All odds correct at time of writing. 18+. begambleaware.org   ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watford-vs-norwich-city-predictions-odds-and-betting-tips/bltabd0d2d867cddd28,By Al Hain-Cole,fdf5e26d-fda8-4f81-aced-f646efdfc492

His last appearance came in the 3-0 defeat against Manchester City on April 20, and he has gone ahead to miss three straight matches ‚Äì the 2-2 draw against Southampton, 3-0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, and their recent 4-0 thumping of Manchester United. On May 10, Mwepu‚Äôs goal against Liverpool in the 2-2 draw at Anfield was voted the Goal of the Season by the club's fans.  In a recent interview, Mwepu admitted he us praying hard to have a free-injury season in the next campaign. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy to come to a new country, with a new language and the weather is not so good,‚Äù Mwepu said.  ‚ÄúMy family have always been supporting me so I am really grateful to them. ‚ÄúThe fans have made it even easier with the support they have given me this season. They have been phenomenal and I have so much I owe them. ""I can only pray that next season I am fit to be consistent the whole season. You never know what I can achieve.  ""I want to be an important player for the team so that is my goal.‚Äù Mwepu‚Äôs second goal of the season came against Arsenal in the 2-1 victory at Emirates Stadium on April 9.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zambia-mwepu-ruled-out-of-brighton-and-hove-albion-fixture/bltb4b0a17cbb5ba091,Dennis Mabuka,076a3827-dea4-419a-aabe-1b9acdccc986
‚ÄòFabio has a lot of quality‚Äô - Bruno Fernandes backs ¬£30m Arsenal signing Vieira to shine in the Premier League,"Bruno Fernandes is one of several Portuguese stars already in the Premier League, and the Manchester United midfielder is backing fellow countryman Fabio Vieira to make an immediate impression at Arsenal. The Gunners have invested ¬£30 million ($36m) in the 22-year-old in a deal which came out of the blue, with those at Emirates Stadium pushing through a big-money deal early in the summer transfer window. Fernandes believes value for money will be found in his fellow countryman who he feels boasts bags of potential. Man Utd playmaker Fernandes told reporters: ‚ÄúI welcome all Portuguese players who go abroad, I hope he can shine to the fullest, except against me. ‚ÄúFabio has a lot of quality and has been demonstrating that, whether in the Porto side or in the Under-21s, he has had good numbers and good performances. ‚ÄúI hope he succeeds like all the Portuguese out there.

Vieira registered seven goals and 16 assists during the 2021-22 campaign, with another fellow countryman ‚Äì ex-West Ham and Southampton defender Jose Fonte ‚Äì among those to have talked up his qualities. The veteran centre-half told talkSPORT: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a very exciting young player who is very talented on the ball and intelligent. ‚ÄúArsenal fans should be very excited because he‚Äôs the sort of player that they‚Äôll like and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing him in the Premier League.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bruno-fernandes-arsenal-signing-vieira-premier-league/bltf70c50ffa6211a3b,Chris Burton,5de31b47-93a2-4469-871a-8db422515da7
Watch: Gallagher gets Panenka penalty all wrong as Chelsea suffer shootout defeat to MLS new boys Charlotte FC,"Conor Gallagher is desperate to prove his worth at Chelsea after returning to Stamford Bridge from a loan spell at Crystal Palace - but he endured a game to forget against Charlotte FC after getting an attempted Panenka penalty all wrong. The England international fluffed his lines in a shootout against the MLS expansion side which resulted in the Premier League heavyweights suffering a shock defeat. The Blues took the lead at Bank of America Stadium through USMNT star Christian Pulisic, but saw Daniel Rios restore parity from the spot in the 92nd minute, leading to a test of nerve from 12 yards ‚Äì with Gallagher scuffing a tame effort straight down the middle.

Aston Villa complete ¬£25m Digne transfer from Everton after Chelsea decided against move,"Aston Villa have completed a ¬£25 million ($34m) deal to sign Lucas Digne from Everton. Digne spent three-and-a-half years on Everton's books after signing from Barcelona in the summer of 2018, featuring in 127 games across all competitions for the Merseyside outfit. The 28-year-old had been a key player in the squad until a public fallout with head coach Rafael Benitez in December 2021, with Chelsea, who were also initially keen on the Frenchman, deciding against making an official bid. As previously confirmed by GOAL on January 12, Digne underwent a medical with Villa after the two clubs agreed a ¬£25m deal. Chelsea were also interested in the left-back, although they decided against making an offer as they focus their attention on recalling Emerson from his loan spell with Lyon. Indeed, the Blues have seen a ¬£3.3m bid to end the loan agreement rejected by the Ligue 1 side, who are determined to keep hold of the Italy international. Digne, meanwhile, could be available to make his debut alongside Barca loanee Philippe Coutinho when Steven Gerrard's side take on Manchester United in the Premier League on January 15. Speaking to Villa's official website, Gerrard said of the transfer: ‚ÄúWhen Lucas became available we jumped at the opportunity to bring him to the club. ‚ÄúTo sign a player of his pedigree and quality in the January window is a great addition to our squad and his arrival excites me and everyone associated with Aston Villa.‚Äù Bonjour, Villans...üá´üá∑ pic.twitter.com/17mZVr1ggY Digne began his career in his homeland with Lille back in 2010 and spent three years at Stade Pierre-Mauroy before being snapped up by Paris Saint-Germain. The France international only made 44 appearances across all competitions for PSG and ended up being sold to Barcelona for ‚Ç¨17m (¬£14m/$19m) in 2016 after a loan spell at Roma. Digne was never able to hold down a regular spot in Barca's starting XI either, but found his feet after joining Everton and has proved he can deliver on a consistent basis at Premier League level. Villa fans will hope he can rediscover his best form as they look to break back into the top half of the table in the second half of the season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aston-villa-sign-digne-25m-chelsea-everton-transfer/blt5451f37557366f67,By Nizaar Kinsella,de2a2b77-eb84-4768-83f2-078e7b27645c
Newcastle star Saint-Maximin charged by FA for wearing branded headband,"Newcastle star Allan Saint-Maximin has been charged by the FA for wearing a branded headband. Saint-Maximin's flamboyant style of play has made him a fan favourite among Newcastle supporters since his move from Nice in 2019. The 25-year-old also stands out due to his fashion choices as he can be seen sporting eye-catching headbands on the pitch each week, but could now be facing punishment for displaying non-football related clothing brand logos. The FA have released a statement confirming that Saint-Maximin has been charged for wearing a Louis Vuitton headband in Premier League games against Wolves and Leicester last month. ""Allan Saint-Maximin has been charged with two breaches of the FA's Kit and Advertising Regulations, contrary to FA regulation B.2,"" the statement from an FA spokesperson reads. ""It is alleged that the Newcastle FC midfielder wore a headband with an established mark or logo of a clothing manufacturer during two Premier League fixtures against Wolverhampton FC and Leicester City FC on 8 April 2022 and 17 April 2022 respectively.  ""He has until 19 May 2022 to provide a response."" pic.twitter.com/ZrfeiWSBbw Saint-Maximin explained why he wears a headband during an interview with GOAL earlier this month, revealing he was inspired by a popular 1993 film about martial arts. ‚ÄúI'm not particularly trying to stand out,"" said the Frenchman. ‚ÄúThe headband, for example, I've always liked Karate Kid, tennis players, but also manga. In the world of manga [Japanese comics and novels], there are mythical characters who wear headbands. In tennis, [Rafa] Nadal and [Roger] Federer also wear them. Karate Kid too. ‚ÄúObviously, wearing a headband while being bald is not the best look. That's what also made me want to find a haircut that could go with my headbands.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/newcastle-star-saint-maximin-charged-by-fa-for-wearing/blt64ccb44e41902d59,James Westwood,087e2613-026f-4c0f-a714-a40f04b99b79

Patrick Vieira has a goalkeeping problem to solve as Jack Butland has broken his arm. Sam Johnstone is also recovering from a thigh injury and remains doubtful.

Liverpool handed injury boost with Alisson fit to face Fulham - but Konate set for spell on sidelines,"Liverpool have been handed a boost ahead of their Premier League opener at Fulham, with Jurgen Klopp confirming goalkeeper Alisson Becker is available for selection after injury. The Brazilian missed last weekend‚Äôs Community Shield win over Manchester City with an abdominal issue picked up during the Reds‚Äô pre-season tour of the Far East, but has returned to full training at Kirkby this week and will start at Craven Cottage on Saturday. Klopp does however have concerns over a host of first-team players, with Ibrahima Konate and Curtis Jones added to a lengthening injury list this week. Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Klopp told reporters that Alisson was ‚Äúfine"" after his injury. The 29-year-old will replace Adrian against Fulham, but Caoimhin Kelleher, Liverpool‚Äôs No.2 goalkeeper, is still a few weeks away from fitness following a groin injury picked up on international duty with the Republic of Ireland in June. Klopp confirmed on Friday that Konate would be out of action for ‚Äúa while‚Äù after sustaining a knock to his knee during the friendly defeat to Strasbourg at Anfield last Sunday. Curtis Jones meanwhile will miss the trip to Fulham with a calf injury, while Diogo Jota is ‚Äúa few weeks‚Äù away from a return after a hamstring issue. Kostas Tsimikas (knee) is expected to resume full training next week, but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (hamstring) is likely to be out for at least six weeks. New signing Calvin Ramsay and teenage forward Kaide Gordon are also currently absent, though both are expected back in action this month. Klopp was asked whether Liverpool‚Äôs injury woes may force the club to move into the transfer market. ‚ÄúWe have too many injuries, that's true, but in the moment nothing has changed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt solve problems we have for four weeks with a transfer‚Äù ‚ÄúAt the moment it makes no sense to us, the transfer window is still open and we will see, but we have no plans.‚Äù He did however suggest that Nat Phillips may be retained as cover, given Konate‚Äôs injury. The 25-year-old has been attracting interest from the likes of Fulham and Bournemouth, but may now stay at Anfield until at least January. ‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù Klopp said when asked if Phillips would be kept.

The tournament was last held back in 2018, when the United States lifted its eighth title by beating Canada 2-0 in the final. In the end, the U.S. secured their place atop CONCACAF once again by taking down Canada, sealing a 1-0 win in the tournament finale The 2022 edition of the CONCACAF W Championship was held in Mexico, with all matches played in the Monterrey region of the country.

The other is Estadio Universitario, the home venue of Tigres which can welcome up to 41,615 fans. Despite hosting the tournament, Mexico still had to go through the qualifying process and were one of the six teams to secure its place by winning its respective qualifying group. The United States and Canada both were granted automatic qualification to the tournament, while the other participating nations finished the qualifying process on April 12. The qualified nations are below. The group stage draw for the tournament was completed on April 19, following the confirmation of the eight qualified nations.

Man of the match Livermore 'owed West Brom after getting sent off like a pr*ck!' - Bruce,"Steve Bruce said that Jake Livermore owed West Brom a man of the match performance after ""getting sent off like a pr*ck"" in his first game in charge of the club. Bruce was appointed West Brom's new permanent manager at the start of February, three-and-a-half months after being sacked by Newcastle. The 61-year-old opened his tenure with a 2-0 loss at Sheffield United, during which Livermore was shown a straight red card, but he welcomed the midfielder back into the fold after his four-game suspension against Hull City on Saturday. Karlan Grant grabbed a brace to seal a 2-0 away win for the Baggies, but it was Livermore who inspired the victory with a superb all-round display in the middle of the park. Bruce was full of praise for the 32-year-old post-match, but also couldn't resist a dig at him for getting suspended in the first place. ‚ÄúI have to say the addition of Jake in midfield, alongside the young kid, just did the trick for us. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve missed,‚Äù¬†the West Brom boss told reporters. ‚ÄúHis reading of the game, the way he broke things up, he owed us that after getting sent off like a pr*ck, but there you go!  ""I can say that about Jake, because he‚Äôll take it the right way!‚Äù After the Sheffield loss, West Brom drew 0-0 with Blackburn before suffering defeats against Luton, Middlesbrough and Swansea. Bruce finally picked up his first win at the helm against Hull, but the Baggies are still down in 13th place in the Championship. West Brom are six points adrift of the playoff places having played a game more than sixth-placed Middlesbrough, and will hope to build up some momentum by securing another win when they take on Huddersfield on March 11.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/livermore-owed-west-brom-getting-sent-off-a-pr-ck-bruce/blt2667efe82c8aee35,James Westwood,f01bb617-0dcc-4a14-8ed1-f1a9f273184b
The incredible story of Alex Popp: Germany's record-breaking Women's Euros debutante,"As the ball hit the back of the net for Germany‚Äôs fourth goal against Denmark, Alexandra Popp looked for a split-second like she was about to wheel away in celebration. But then the emotion hit her. She sank to her knees, her head hit the grass and she smacked the ground repeatedly as her team-mates swarmed and congratulated her. This wasn‚Äôt just a cherry-on-the-cake goal for Germany, as they swept aside the 2017 Women‚Äôs Euros runners-up in their opening fixture of this summer‚Äôs edition. It was Popp‚Äôs debut in this competition and she‚Äôd marked it with her first goal ‚Äì at 31 years old. Since then, she‚Äôs scored five more times, becoming the first player ever to score in five successive Women‚Äôs Euro games. On Wednesday night, her brace sent Germany into the 2022 final, helping them to overcome France by a 2-1 scoreline. A three-time Champions League winner and a footballer widely ‚Äì and rightly ‚Äì recognised as one of Germany‚Äôs best, her record-breaking run and chance to finally shine on this stage has been one of the stories of the summer. Since making her senior international debut in 2010, Popp has twice been cruelly denied the chance to represent her country at a Euros. In 2013, fresh off the back of her second European club title, it was an ankle injury that stopped her being part of the Germany team that won its eighth trophy on the continent. Four years later, a knee injury was the problem. In fact, had this summer‚Äôs tournament not been delayed a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, she‚Äôd have missed it again due to another terrible knee injury, this one sidelining her for 11 months. The way she is playing in England, you can see the positive impact of those negative experiences ‚Äì the enjoyment, the value she is placing on every moment. ‚ÄúIt means a lot to me [to be here], I have to admit,‚Äù she explained on Wednesday evening. ‚ÄúYou saw it on the first goal but also in the other games ‚Äì I am more emotional than I used to be because I know how I have arrived at this point. ‚ÄúBeing here, having this opportunity to perform like this, being fully fit at this stage, that makes me very proud, but I also have to say a big thanks to everyone who has been there with me. ‚ÄúThe medical staff who have always motivated me in the rehab. My coaches at my club and the national club, they kept believing in me and gave me the opportunity to get to where I had to be to be here.  ""That makes me extremely proud and I'm very happy that I'm allowed to play here and that we've reached the final. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an incredible story and I hope we will have a very nice happy ending.‚Äù It‚Äôs been six years since Germany won a major title ‚Äì Olympic gold at Rio 2016. For a team as well-decorated as this one, both historically as a national team but also given the individuals in the squad who are used to winning trophies, that‚Äôs a long, long time. Thanks to Popp, though, they are one step closer. Alex Popp this tournament üî• #WEURO2022 pic.twitter.com/yMDT7e2l9b It‚Äôs not just her goals that have played a huge role in the road to Wembley. As captain of this side, she leads in many ways. One of those is in her performances on the pitch. Another is in her personality as a winner and a motivator. But her experience and how she deals with situations in a game is crucial too. ‚ÄúWe need their experience and their calmness when there are obstacles,‚Äù Martin Voss-Tecklenburg, Germany‚Äôs head coach, explained when asked about the importance of the older players in her squad, such as Popp. Her comments came after her striker had spent the first 10 minutes of the post-match press conference taking questions, before heading off to celebrate with her team. Voss-Tecklenburg spent that time smiling at Popp and nodding as she batted away questions about her records, the Golden Boot race ‚Äì which she is now joint-top of with England‚Äôs Beth Mead, and anything to do with individual glory, reiterating that it was about the collective. ‚ÄúI've been in this team for 10 years now,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe team spirit that we have in this team, I've never experienced anything like that. This makes it so special.‚Äù On top of her own form, that is another factor that is making this tournament so much fun for Popp. Having endured such a long and arduous path to this point, it‚Äôs something she is savouring even more. ‚ÄúTo be honest, I have the impression that at the moment I can experience these moments a lot more,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI'm enjoying these moments a lot more.  ""The football, I like it even more than before. That sounds silly. It doesn't mean I didn't like football before but it kind of became a bit pedestrian. ‚ÄúNow, to have the moments on the pitch, to play here, I value that a lot and that makes it very special to be here.‚Äù On Sunday, she‚Äôll get to enjoy a Women‚Äôs Euros final at a sold-out Wembley Stadium, as Germany play hosts England for the trophy. If she and her team keep playing like this, she‚Äôll still be enjoying it come full-time as well.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/incredible-story-alex-popp-germany-record-breaking-women/blt511a8d64ddfe4ea2,Ame√© Ruszkai,80a72912-248f-44c8-a04d-b89fa60a8e4b
"‚ÄòPulisic isn't a wing-back, he doesn't have a defensive bone in his body!‚Äô - Chelsea‚Äôs use of USMNT star puzzles Johnson","Christian Pulisic‚Äôs versatility has been put to good use at Chelsea this season, with the United States international being asked to fill a number of different roles, but Glen Johnson says the 23-year-old is definitely not a wing-back as he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have a defensive bone in his body‚Äù. A man more at home in a wide attacking berth would probably agree with that, but Pulisic has been doing his bit for the collective cause of late after being moved into striking and defensive berths rather than his typical winger role by Blues boss Thomas Tuchel. He has not looked entirely comfortable in either new position, when operating as a false nine or as an advanced full-back, and Johnson believes a long-term future will be earned by a talented USMNT star once he has overcome form and fitness issues to prove himself back in a more natural position. Quizzed on whether the American has a place in Chelsea‚Äôs long-term plans, ex-Blues right-back Johnson ‚Äì speaking in association with BoyleSports ‚Äì told GOAL: ‚ÄúI think he does. I like him a lot, but I don‚Äôt want to see him at right wing-back because he hasn‚Äôt got a defensive bone in his body! ‚ÄúHe is so good going forward and you can‚Äôt expect him to be good at it all. I don‚Äôt think he is a wing-back at all. Somebody like him playing on the left of [Romelu] Lukaku, and [Hakim] Ziyech on the right, you are going to struggle to get three better. ‚ÄúPulisic works his socks off, I know the lads like him in training and around the place, so he‚Äôs a good lad. He‚Äôs someone that is willing to work hard and play out of position, but I think to get the best out of him he is definitely better out wide on the left.‚Äù Tuchel is still searching for a system that brings the absolute best out of those at his disposal, with questions being asked of whether Chelsea are playing to the strengths of ¬£98 million frontman Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian has suggested that he is a little frustrated at present, but Johnson believes a proven performer needs to tinker with his game rather than expecting others to bow to his needs. He said of the Lukaku poser in west London: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt play to one man‚Äôs strengths, you have to play to the team‚Äôs strengths. If he doesn‚Äôt fit that then that‚Äôs his problem, not the team‚Äôs problem. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fan of him, he‚Äôs a fantastic player and he will score goals, but Chelsea concede more goals when he plays and score more when he doesn‚Äôt play. I don‚Äôt think he should be barking orders, he should be trying to fit into the style of play. He has got some world-class players around him and he‚Äôs an intelligent player so it won‚Äôt be hard for him to work it out. ‚ÄúSometimes at the moment, when he does play, they go to him too quickly and too direct. That‚Äôs too easy to defend against because they are so spread out, the defenders know it‚Äôs going to Lukaku and they jump on him, put two men around him, and if they lose the ball there, then you are open to the counter ‚Äì that‚Äôs why they concede a lot. If they can find a way of playing that is across the two styles, then he could be a massive player for them. ‚ÄúHe is the main man, they bought him to be the final piece of the puzzle as being that big striker they were missing, but they still have a fantastic side. They weren‚Äôt one man away, they still have brilliant players and a good way of playing. He needs to fit into it.‚Äù While the Blues are looking to invest long-term in Lukaku‚Äôs obvious talents, some serious concerns are surfacing at the other end of the field. Antonio Rudiger, Thiago Silva, Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta are all due to be out of contract in the summer of 2022, with there a very real threat that some serious talent and experience will walk away for nothing in a matter of months. Johnson said of that situation: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bonkers. Chelsea normally do their business very, very well ‚Äì they bring players through and if they aren‚Äôt good enough, they sell them for fortunes and they keep recycling. ‚ÄúThose players are so hard to replace. Rudiger has come back to life, he‚Äôs playing well, Azpilicueta will run through walls for you ‚Äì these players are hard to find and when you‚Äôve got them, the easiest thing to do is to keep them on a contract. You can‚Äôt let them go for free. I‚Äôm sure they will be looking at keeping at least two of them. ‚ÄúIf you were going to buy four players that are the equivalent of those four, you are going to be spending over ¬£200m ‚Äì it‚Äôs crazy. Let‚Äôs be honest, they aren‚Äôt going to be earning ¬£200m between them so it doesn‚Äôt make financial sense to let them go for free and try to replace them. ‚ÄúThiago Silva, the youngsters watching him train is beneficial, and he‚Äôs still performing. He doesn‚Äôt have the legs to do it every week, but to have people like that, you just can‚Äôt find other players like that.‚Äù Big decisions on contracts and further additions will need to be made at some stage, but Tuchel is currently more concerned with an alarming wobble from his team that has them looking over their shoulder in a keenly-contested battle for top-four finishes. Failure will not be accepted there, despite landing another Champions League crown in 2021, and Johnson admits that Roman Abramovich will be demanding better than the Blues have been producing of late. Quizzed on how much patience a European triumph will have bought Tuchel, Johnson ‚Äì who took in Premier League and League Cup triumphs with the Blues in 2004-05 ‚Äì said: ‚ÄúNot a lot when Roman‚Äôs the boss! We know it‚Äôs the hottest seat in world football regardless of whether you win stuff or not. If the main man falls out of love with you, you aren‚Äôt going to be there very long. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Roman will be very pleased if the title race is over by the end of January. That will be important. If the title race is over, he will see it as a flop. It‚Äôs going to be hard to catch City, but the race has got to go a lot longer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to say the man is under pressure, because I don‚Äôt think he is and I don‚Äôt think he deserves to be because he‚Äôs done a great job, but we know that if Roman gets something in his head, it‚Äôs going to be his way.‚Äù Tuchel will have the opportunity to get Chelsea back on track in their next outing, with fellow title hopefuls Liverpool due to pay a visit to Stamford Bridge on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-wing-back-defensive-bone-body-chelsea-usmnt-johnson/bltd91b6ae249ced0d0,Chris Burton,aefac200-0bbf-454b-8771-a2dee80169b2
2022 World Cup: Ghana FA boss Okraku pumped up for Uruguay showdown in Qatar,"Ghana Football Association president Kurt Okraku believes it is time for the Black Stars to pay Uruguay back for the pain of the 2010 World Cup after the two teams were drawn together for the upcoming 2022 tournament in Qatar. 12 years on from what remains one of the most memorable games in World Cup history, the Black Stars have been handed a chance for revenge after being placed in Group H, which also features Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs Portugal, and Son Heung-Min‚Äôs South Korea.  At South Africa 2010, Ghana suffered a 4-2 quarter-final penalty shoot-out defeat following a 1-1 draw after extra-time, after Luis Suarez‚Äôs handball denied the Black Stars a likely match-winner and Asamoah Gyan blasted the resulting spot-kick against the crossbar.  ""We believe that it will be revenge time,"" Ghana FA president Kurt Okraku told BBC Sport Africa on Friday‚Äôs draw.  ""We thought we had clearly won that particular game but for that save from Suarez. It is very interesting for us to pitch against them again, obviously with fond memories [this time]. ""It is important that we all set the record straight."" Ghana are set for a World Cup return after missing out on the 2018 edition of the tournament in Russia. At the November 21 - December 18 championship in Qatar, the Black Stars will open their campaign against Portugal at Stadium 974 in Doha on November 24. Four days later, the Black Stars return to action with a clash with South Korea at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan. The big showdown with Uruguay then follows on December 2, the Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah is confirmed to host the game.  While targeting victory over La Celeste, Ghana will also hope to qualify to the knockout stage to make up for their poor showing at the 2014 World Cup where they suffered first-round elimination. It was their first time failing to go past the group stage, having made the Round of 16 on their debut at Germany 2006, and gone on to reach the quarter-finals in 2010.

'Unbelievable' Maguire defended by Manchester United legend Ferdinand and compared to Pique,"Rio Ferdinand has jumped to the defence of ""unbelievable"" Manchester United captain Harry Maguire while comparing his struggles at Old Trafford to those endured by Gerard Pique at the start of his career. Maguire, who joined United from Leicester City in a record-breaking ¬£80 million ($104m) deal in 2019, has been subjected to intense criticism throughout the season. The 29-year-old has led a Red Devils defence that has only managed eight clean sheets in 31 games, making a number of errors along the way, but Ferdinand believes he still has plenty to offer. The Man Utd legend has pointed to Maguire's record for England as proof of his quality, with the centre-back having helped his country reach the World Cup semi-final and European Championship final over the past four years. ‚ÄúIn an England shirt he‚Äôs been nothing but phenomenal. He‚Äôs been unreal. You can‚Äôt say he‚Äôs a dead player, he‚Äôs been unbelievable for England,‚Äù Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel FIVE. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is, for England he‚Äôs been great, but they play a particular way of football that probably suits him."" Ferdinand has suggested United's style doesn't play to Maguire's strengths, which he says was the same problem Pique had at Old Trafford before the Spaniard left for Barcelona in 2008 and went on to become one of Europe's best defenders. ‚ÄúGerard Pique was at Man Utd, you could argue that he might not have had the career that he‚Äôs had at Barcelona if he stayed at Man Utd because of the way he plays,"" Ferdinand added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like boxing, styles make fights ‚Äì it‚Äôs the same in football. The way of Man Utd‚Äôs football, and the way that they are trying to play, hasn‚Äôt suited him. ‚ÄúAlso form and confidence. His confidence has taken a big knock and I don‚Äôt care who you are, you could be Messi, Ronaldo, Zidane, Mbappe all these players ‚Äì if their confidence is low they are not the same player.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maguire-defended-manchester-united-ferdinand-pique/blt2fa6bc78dd545b9c,James Westwood,261f6f0f-e0dd-457f-838b-a818cbf29ef4

Barcelona‚Äôs Aubameyang moves up to third in Europa League scoring charts,"Gabon captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalled Munas Dabbur's Uefa Europa League goal haul after netting the winner against Galatasaray in the Round of 16 second leg duel on Thursday. After going down in the 28th minute, Barcelona fought back and equalized nine minutes later, before Aubameyang scored the winning goal early in the second half.

"‚ÄòMaybe yes, maybe no‚Äô - De Bruyne's response when asked if Guardiola has made him a better player","Kevin De Bruyne would prefer not to give a definitive answer to questions of whether he has improved while working under the guidance of Pep Guardiola, with the Manchester City talisman choosing to deliver a ‚Äúmaybe yes, maybe no‚Äù response. The Belgium international midfielder has starred during the reign of the Catalan coach at the Etihad Stadium, with three Premier League titles and four League Cup triumphs complemented by back-to-back PFA Player of the Year successes. De Bruyne has taken in over 250 appearances as Guardiola calls the shots, enhancing his reputation as one of the finest creative talents on the planet, but the 30-year-old remains reluctant to be drawn on whether he is a better player now than he was in 2016. When that question was put to the talented Belgian ahead of a Champions League semi-final second-leg clash with Real Madrid, De Bruyne said: ‚ÄúIt's hard to tell. Maybe yes, maybe no. ‚ÄúObviously he has helped me to progress in various ways but it's hard to say I would or would not be like this with other managers. ‚ÄúHe has done amazing things with me and the team to get success but the players work very hard to achieve that - if you don't want to listen or work hard you won't get better. ‚ÄúIt is a combination of everything.

Quizzed on whether he feels like the best version of himself, De Bruyne added: ‚ÄúYou guys can tell me. ‚ÄúThe first months of the season were really hard, I have never experienced the pain that I had back then. I was trying to come back but was in pain with my ankle every day and it wasn't something I enjoyed. ‚ÄúMentally it was hard to overcome that but once the pain was gone after a couple of months I started to feel more confident in myself and my body to get back to where I belong and now playing all these games week in, week out, I feel back to the level that I was before. ‚ÄúI don't know if there is much difference from before, I just try to be as constant as I can and I think I have managed myself very well.‚Äù De Bruyne has taken in 40 appearances for City across all competitions this season, registering 15 goals and 12 assists.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maybe-yes-maybe-no-de-bruyne-guardiola-made-him-better/blt1b9d054f06c76c1f,Chris Burton,d1dba063-5f8a-4866-8270-10d2c0eb3cda
Paris via Beirut! Liverpool fans set for another Champions League trip to remember,"The exodus is well and truly under way. All week, the UK‚Äôs airports, ports and train stations have been filled. Filled with red shirts, with scouse accents, with beaming smiles and with the sound of hope and optimism. As one supporter at Lime Street station joked: ‚ÄúParis won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs hit it!‚Äù For Liverpool fans, the European Cup will always be the one which gets the pulse racing. The Premier League may have eluded them, but they will descend on the French capital en masse this weekend, as Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side look to end a brilliant season with yet another piece of silverware. It has been suggested that around 40,000 Reds will make the short trip across the English Channel to watch their side take on Real Madrid in the Stade de France on Saturday evening, but anecdotal evidence suggests that may be a conservative estimate. After all, the main talking point among Liverpudlians - Klopp‚Äôs magnificent team aside - has been clear for weeks now. ‚ÄòHow are you getting to Paris?‚Äô Some have had their trips planned since February, when UEFA confirmed it would be switching the venue of the final from St Petersburg. Flights and hotels were booked almost on the spot, even though Liverpool were in the midst of a tough last-16 clash with Inter at the time. ‚ÄúYou have to gamble with things like that,‚Äù says Reds fan and journalist Kristian Walsh. ‚ÄúYou have to book early, otherwise you can end up paying ¬£500 ($624) or more for a simple two-hour flight.‚Äù Walsh and his group of away-day regulars already had their St Petersburg route planned - via Helsinki, if you are interested - but as soon as Paris was confirmed they took the plunge again. They will spend a night in Brussels before travelling across to France by train on Friday. ‚ÄúThe biggest thing, and I can‚Äôt stress this enough, is that we fly from Liverpool,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFlying from Manchester for the semi-final [with Villarreal], the security queue was like something from The Hunger Games!‚Äù The plane-train combination seems to be a popular one with supporters, and no wonder, given the cost of direct flights. A return from Liverpool or Manchester to Paris, flying on Friday and returning on Sunday, comes in at around ¬£750 ($937), while some companies, such as Sport Options or Football Travel Ltd, are running day trips, priced at around ¬£650 ($812). Such expense means many fans have had to get creative. Brussels and Amsterdam are the most popular stop-offs, but Frankfurt, Geneva, Cologne and Zurich are other options. All are within a few hours of Paris via train. And how about something a little more left-field? You may have read about the Sunderland fan who travelled via Mallorca to London for the League One play-off final, but how about the Reds supporter who will head to Paris this week via Beirut? ‚ÄúHe shall remain nameless,‚Äù laughs Walsh. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs known for his, shall we say, ‚Äòunusual‚Äô travel plans. ‚ÄúInitially he was flying via Tirana, I think, but he realised that was a bit silly, so he changed it. The things we do for football!‚Äù What a football team but more importantly what a group of wonderful people who have helped me get through the last two years and I‚Äôll be forever thankful. This hasn‚Äôt been easy but it would have been a lot harder without these. pic.twitter.com/cOkXZhlXYu He can say that again. The world‚Äôs apparent desire to fleece supporters never ceases to amaze. Eurostar bumped its prices up as soon as it became apparent that at least one English club would be reaching the final, while a quick scan for hotel rooms in Paris this weekend tells you everything, with single rooms in two-star venues priced at more than ¬£550 ($687) a night. Some have even seen bookings cancelled and then re-listed, as vendors look to maximise their profits. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, that is the world we live in,‚Äù said a rueful Klopp earlier this month. It is little wonder, then, that some fans have booked into campsites on the outskirts of the city, many more will sleep in cars and on coaches, while others are opting for the simple but risky ‚Äústaying out all night‚Äù option. Tickets are another issue - the biggest issue, in fact. UEFA‚Äôs decision to allocate less than 20,000 tickets to Liverpool fans drew stinging criticism from Klopp, as well as from Spirit of Shankly, the supporters‚Äô union, and though many were given a second chance through the sale of 12,000 general admission tickets, the fact remains that almost a third of the stadium‚Äôs 80,000 capacity will be taken up by UEFA delegates, sponsors, commercial partners and hospitality tickets. It means the black market is thriving. GOAL has seen ¬£50 ($62) tickets being re-sold for more than ¬£1500 ($1800), and the fact that more than 20 percent of Liverpool‚Äôs 19,618 allocation were priced at more than ¬£400 ($500) to begin with tells you plenty. The club this week urged social media companies to close the accounts of fans attempting to sell final tickets online. Liverpool said they had themselves cancelled the tickets of 13 individuals, who it is understood had been demanding thousands of pounds from fellow supporters for their tickets. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no surprise,‚Äù says Reds fan Dan Nicolson. ‚ÄúWhen the allocation is so low, these things are bound to happen. It‚Äôs the same every year, it just so happens that Liverpool have tended to be in more finals than most. ‚ÄúHopefully one day, there will be a concerted and unified message from fans that paltry allocations that mean actual supporters are in the minority in the stadium are not good enough.‚Äù Nicolson is the driving force behind the legendary ‚ÄòBOSS Night‚Äô events, which have provided the colour and soundtrack to so many of Liverpool‚Äôs European away days in recent years. The party in Kyiv‚Äôs Shevchenko Park in 2018 will never be forgotten, while Virgil van Dijk watched videos of the following year‚Äôs event in Madrid‚Äôs Plaza Felipe II as part of his pre-match preparation. ‚ÄúIt gave me chills,‚Äù the Dutchman told GOAL. ‚ÄúI saw it after lunch and I was so excited, I just wanted to get out there, get the trophy and party with them.‚Äù What does @VirgilvDijk think of his song?I think he quite likes it, @JamieWebster94...#LFC pic.twitter.com/VmIYKLMr1p There will, after much discussion and plenty of back and forth with the French authorities, be another ‚ÄòBOSS‚Äô event on Saturday. It will take place at Cours de Vincennes in the east of the city, with the likes of Jamie Webster, Kieran Molyneux and Timo Tierney, as well as the Lightning Seeds and Cast frontman John Power, all scheduled to perform. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to get it sorted,‚Äù says Nicolson. ‚ÄúAfter the success of Kyiv and Madrid, it would have been a crying shame if we had not been able to have another afternoon to remember in Paris. Hopefully everyone can enjoy themselves now.‚Äù That - ‚Äúenjoyment‚Äù - seems to be a word which crops up everywhere when speaking to supporters. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt have fun as a Liverpudlian now, you‚Äôre in the wrong game,‚Äù says Walsh. ‚ÄúIt's not just about the destination, it's the journey. That's where the enjoyment comes, from the ride. Even for a pessimist like me, the ride this season - and over the past few years - has been something incredible."" For Nicolson, the key figure underpinning everything is Klopp. With the German at the helm, everyone is on board. ‚ÄúHe is this century‚Äôs Shankly,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you can even refer to him as generational. He‚Äôs more rare! ‚ÄúEverything comes from him. The feel-good factor, the winning mentality, the way everything is just fun. It emanates from Klopp and infects us all! ‚ÄúA friend said to me recently that supporting Liverpool FC is like one big stag do, but a stag do you actually want to be on! ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs dead exciting, everyone is just having a great time."" That will continue this weekend, for sure. Whatever the result in Paris, there will be a celebratory parade in Liverpool on Sunday afternoon, where fans will line the streets to pay tribute to the heroes who have taken them on the ride of a lifetime. ""They deserve it,"" says Walsh. ""And hopefully, they'll have that Champions League trophy to show off...""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/paris-via-beirut-liverpool-fans-champions-league-final/bltdeae67ebd09da888,Neil Jones,d109210e-f4a9-48de-9dbe-ab0a2325ed1e
Hazard rules out summer transfer as injury-plagued Real Madrid star cites desire to 'show everybody what I can do',"Eden Hazard has ruled out a summer departure from Real Madrid, insisting he is desperate to ‚Äúshow everyone what I can do‚Äù after an injury-plagued three years at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Belgium star cost Real ‚Ç¨140 million (¬£118m/$155m) when he joined from Chelsea in 2019 but a succession of injuries, particularly a persistent ankle problem, have stymied his impact. That sparked speculation Los Blancos could look to move Hazard on this summer, but the 31-year-old is determined to remain at the Spanish giants. Hazard‚Äôs latest injury set back saw him undergo surgery at the end of March to remove a plate that was originally put in after he broke his ankle in March 2020. That was enough to rule him out of the rest of the domestic season but Hazard is hopeful of playing some part in Saturday‚Äôs Champions League final against Liverpool. ‚ÄúThe surgery went well. Everything is going well at the moment,‚Äù he told Het Laatste Nieuws. ""I am ready just in time to play a part in the Champions League final. I didn't want to go too fast like last time. The coach understood my situation, as did the medical staff. We have worked well. Now I feel really good.‚Äù Real boss Carlo Ancelotti has already stated his intention to keep Hazard this summer and has backed the player to show his ‚Äúquality‚Äù in a Blancos shirt. Hazard is keen to repay Ancelotti‚Äôs faith in his abilities ‚ÄúThe coach knows that I still have a contract until 2024. My first three seasons at Real have not gone well,‚Äù added Hazard, who has made just 47 top-flight appearances over the course of three seasons in Madrid and has not played since February. ‚ÄúSo I want to show everyone what I can do. Starting with this Saturday. It has always been a dream to play for Real. It still is.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/hazard-rules-out-summer-transfer-as-injury-plagued-real/blt2130a46ab94ff193,Tom Mallows,d47bd5a7-0a07-4997-b1c7-13172a62065f
Arsenal-linked Osimhen relives horror ‚Äònear-death‚Äô injury at Napoli that left him with 18 screws in his jaw,"Napoli striker Victor Osimhen, who has been heavily linked with Arsenal during the current transfer window, has revealed that a ‚Äúnear-death‚Äù injury picked up in November 2021 left him with 18 screws in his jaw. The Nigeria international was forced from the field early in the second half during a Serie A contest at San Siro after suffering a sickening clash of heads with Inter defender Milan Skriniar. Major surgery was required in order to piece his face back together, with a man that still went on to hit 18 goals across the campaign as a whole lifting the lid on an incident that was memorable for all of the wrong reasons. The 23-year-old frontman has told Wazobia FM: ‚ÄúThat injury I had against Inter Milan was like a near-death injury. ‚ÄúI am the only one that felt it, and I can only speak about how I felt because it was my face and body. ‚ÄúBut to be able to stand up without using the stretcher, walk out of the pitch on my own, then I knew that it was something I could handle. ‚ÄúFor me, as I got to the hospital, I told my doctor that I would be out for two weeks maximum.‚Äù Osimhen added, with the ailment eventually keeping him out of action for the best part of two months, before returning with a protective mask: ‚ÄúWhen the scan came out, I fractured many bones, which they had to remove and fix inside again. I have like 18 screws under my jaw. I went through a lot. ‚ÄúA lot of sleepless nights. I could not sleep, I could not eat with the pain. But at the end of the day, I am a lion, and I know the kind of mentality I have. ‚ÄúIn my mind, I had already scheduled my return following the surgery.‚Äù Osimhen has now found the target on 28 occasions through two seasons at Napoli, with his stock continuing to rise as further potential is unlocked. He is said to be registering on recruitment radars across Europe, with plenty of big-spending sides in the Premier League keeping a close eye on his development. Arsenal have generated the most speculation there, but GOAL has been able to confirm that the Gunners have a ¬£45 million ($55m) agreement in place for Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus. Manchester United have also been credited with interest in Osimhen, and they remain in the market for more attacking talent. The Nigerian star will not be easily prised from Napoli‚Äôs clutches, though, with reports suggesting that he has a ‚Ç¨100m (¬£86m/$106m) price tag around his neck.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-linked-osimhen-horror-near-death-injury-napoli18/blt9379c5347ed5f55e,Chris Burton,7bcf04a3-4c6f-4f7a-bc92-0772bdfd74fb
'Nonsensical football!' - Hummels fumes after Borussia Dortmund are trounced by Rangers,"Borussia Dortmund endured one of their worst defensive performances in European competition in their history as they suffered a 4-2 loss at home to Rangers. The German side have a mountain to climb in their Europa League knockout round play-off tie against the Glasgow side after losing at home on Thursday. Their display against Giovanni van Bronckhorst came as a severe disappointment for defender Mats Hummels, who criticised his side for another defensively sloppy display at home.  ""If you look at the Leverkusen game [a 4-2 loss for Dortmund], we conceded four goals after unnecessarily losing the ball,"" Hummels said after Thursday's game.  ""That happened with the first, second and fourth goals here. ""I think we know what our problem is. The coach mentions it often enough. ""We‚Äôre playing an awful lot of nonsensical football, a lot of illogical football and making our opponents so strong. ""Our football is also too complicated.

Ex-Man Utd coach insists Ten Hag is the right man to fix Red Devils,"Erik ten Hag is the right man to whip Manchester United into shape, according to former coach Eric Steele, who believes the Dutchman can restore the club's prized culture with his arrival. The Ajax boss will take the reins at Old Trafford from next season, as he looks to restore the fortunes of the Red Devils. Ten Hag will inherit a squad low on belief and fractured by division, but Steele very much believes he is the figure best suited to the job. ""I've never known so much information come out of Manchester United's dressing room and become public,"" Steele told Sky Sports News. ""I'm sure he will very quickly discipline them and say, 'this has got to stop', which is precisely what's needed. I don't think he'll allow any of that."" Steele added that he hoped the Dutchman would bring unity, stating: ""When I was there you had big characters - the big players ran the dressing room, and that's what you want. ""You want them to have the belief, come in every day and want to be successful, to train hard every day to better the club, improve the team and be successful. At the moment it seems very much it's individuals being discussed and not the team."" Elsewhere, Steele was critical of the combative atmosphere that appears to have emerged between players, highlighting the lack of cohesive belief between them. ""There's arguments on the field between players,"" he added. ""Things that have happened in the dressing room that have come out - those simply wouldn't have happened when I was there under Sir Alex. ""So I think they have to get the culture right on and off the field, and I'm sure Ten Hag is the man to get them back to where they ought to be: in the top four.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-man-utd-coach-insists-ten-hag-is-the-right-man-to-fix-red/blt4ee7d323a26b88a7,Andrew Steel,990f1b04-f873-451f-93ef-ab8be2e96536
James Trafford: Man City's teenage goalkeeper following in Ederson's footsteps,"Manchester City‚Äôs academy goalkeeper James Trafford had a clever way of getting himself noticed by Pep Guardiola. In a post-training penalty shootout, the England youth international kept out a spot-kick from the City boss! ‚ÄúHe just started laughing,‚Äù Trafford tells GOAL in an exclusive interview. ‚ÄúThey often take penalties at the end of training. He'd always say if you'd done well in training and he‚Äôs been really good with me.‚Äù The highly-rated youngster is one of a number of talented, young goalkeepers coming through the City academy, with teenage Ireland international Gavin Bazunu enjoying a fine season on loan at Portsmouth, while Netherlands Under-18 international Mikki van Sans is the regular starter for the club's U23s in Premier League 2. Ahead of all of them, of course, is Ederson, who is firmly established as the club's first choice while United States number one Zack Steffen provides high-quality back-up. City, then, are more than well-stocked for quality goalkeepers, but that is not going to affect the ambition of 19-year-old Trafford. ‚ÄúIf I didn't believe I could do it I would just leave, because what's the point in being at a club where you don't see yourself as being number one?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really bothered about the money - if I didn't see myself as becoming City's number one, I wouldn't be here.‚Äù The teenager spent much of last season around the first-team squad at City, learning from goalkeeping coach Xabi Mancisidor, whom Guardiola rates as the best in the world. Trafford was on the bench as the third-choice 'keeper for the Champions League victories away to Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as the Carabao Cup semi-final win at Manchester United, and was the number two against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane in the Premier League. Training alongside Ederson, Steffen and the paternal figure of third-choice Scott Carson was an enlightening environment which showed him exactly what was needed to succeed at the top. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ‚ÄúThe biggest thing I learned from all of them is that they're always at it,‚Äù Trafford says. ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter whether they get back at midnight and the night before they‚Äôve travelled on the plane for hours, everyday they're at it - they don't have a day off. ‚ÄúIt's why they are where they are, they push each other and you have to rise to their level or you're screwed You'd kill the session. ‚ÄúYou just have to keep getting better and better because Ederson‚Äôs at a level where no one else is really at. On the ball, he's just as good as some of the outfield players, it‚Äôs just a joke.‚Äù Like Ederson, Cumbrian-born Trafford started his footballing career as an outfield player, but was convinced to switch to playing in goal. He had trials at League Two outfit Carlisle United as a midfielder, but his father suggested taking being a goalkeeper more seriously. ‚ÄúI always played in goal with my dad and he thought I was quite good, but I didn‚Äôt have a clue about football,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúHe was saying, 'you're a goalkeeper, and I said, 'no, I'm a midfielder,' because no one really wants to be a goalie. ‚ÄúWhenever we went to training he always used to put my gloves in in the car, and one time at training they said we need another goalie and I gave it a go, got my gloves and loved it.‚Äù Trafford trained under Carlisle‚Äôs former head of academy goalkeeping Ben Benson, who also discovered Manchester United and England star Dean Henderson, and believed the City youngster had potential to succeed in the position. He was spotted by City at the age of 12 and moved to Manchester, living in club accommodation during the week before travelling back for weekend‚Äôs on the family farm. Players such as James McAtee and CJ Egan-Riley, both of whom have made debuts for the City first-team this season, grew up alongside Trafford, and that 2002-born group remain close, encouraging one another onto further success. ‚ÄúWe wouldn't say it to each other‚Äôs faces because we're young lads so we like to have a joke about it, but we all want the best for each other and we all back each other up,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIt's a really close group.‚Äù This season, Trafford is on a season-long loan at League One side Accrington Stanley, and has started half their league games thus far, keeping two clean sheets. With one of the lowest budgets in the division, the Wham Stadium is a world away from the state-of-the-art facilities at City‚Äôs Etihad Campus, but Stanley are also one of the best run clubs in the country, avoiding high risks in the hope of instant success. ‚ÄúThe biggest difference is youth-team football is a lot more predictable (compared to first-team),‚Äù Trafford says. ‚ÄúEveryone tries to keep the ball, it's more possession-oriented and a lot more predictable. If there's a loose ball, nine times out of 10, they'll try get it down on the deck and play it. ‚ÄúPlaying in the league and first-team football, it's a lot more hitting areas and it's more unpredictable for a goalkeeper. At any moment the ball could come in behind the defence and you could have to come out for it. Youth-team football, you can kind of anticipate when it's coming."" As well as earning experience at Accrington, Trafford has also been a regular for England U20s this season, having represented the Three Lions at every age-group since U16s. For a reluctant goalkeeper who had to be cajoled into taking on the gloves, then, Trafford's future could be huge.

Nunez shushes trolls after missed chances & delivers message to doubters after ¬£64m Liverpool transfer,"Darwin Nunez is only a matter of minutes into his Liverpool career, but the Uruguay striker is already having to contend with online trolls that are ready to write him off as a ¬£64-million ($79m) flop. The 23-year-old striker has been in pre-season action for the Reds, with a couple of chances passing him by during outings against Manchester United and Crystal Palace. Nunez's pedigree, which includes 34 goals for Benfica last season, suggests that he knows his way to the back of the net, and the highly-rated South American is not about to let a few detractors get to him as he takes to shushing away their criticism. Nunez took aim at any doubters following his second-half appearance in the 2-0 victory over Palace in Singapore during which Jordan Henderson and Mohamed Salah were on target. One opportunity did come and go for the South American, with a slight deflection doing him few favours as Vicente Guaita kept out a close-range effort. After seeing some suggest that he should have opened his account by now, Nunez has stated that his ‚Äúresilience‚Äù will not be knocked and that anybody questioning him should zip their mouth. Resiliencia ü§´ pic.twitter.com/e90QJAdpc7 Liverpool will be back in action on Thursday once they have returned to Europe from a trip to Asia.

'Casillas didn't talk to me' ‚Äì Pique says Mourinho made Spain's Real Madrid & Barcelona players hate each other,"Gerard Pique has revealed the extent of the damage that the rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona during Jose Mourinho's spell in the Spanish capital had on the players. The Portuguse coach took over at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2010 and his team's battles with Pep Guardiola's Barcelona became more intense. Pique has revealed that the atmosphere poisoned things between players on both sides, as Spain team-mate and Madrid star Iker Casillas stopped speaking to him. He told the Overlap podcast: ‚ÄúSince he arrived, he knew that on the pitch they were weaker than us.  ""We had a better team for sure, and even the relationships between players.  ‚ÄúI remember going to the national team and after those games it was tough because Mourinho goes to the mind of the player and he says: ‚ÄòThese guys hate you‚Äô, then you believe that. ‚ÄúI was in the dressing room of the national team and went to Iker Casillas: ‚ÄòHey Iker‚Äô, and the guy did not talk to me. ‚ÄúAt that time I did not know, but it was the coach he really knows how to go into the mind.‚Äù Pique believes that the intensity of the Clasico rivalry played a factor in Guardiola's decision to leave the club, saying:  ""We were winning everything at the time and I remember that the first time Mourinho came to Camp Nou he lost 5-0 against us. ""It was a shock of reality that these guys are going hard, but in the press conferences every time he was, you know his style, and I think that for Guardiola at some point it was too much. ""It was more important sometimes what happened off the pitch than on the pitch. ‚ÄúGuardiola left.

'How can I not feel responsible?' - Bielsa worried about leaky Leeds defence after conceding four more to Man Utd,"Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa admits that he is concerned by the ease with which his side concedes goals, after seeing Manchester United net four times at Elland Road on Sunday.  The Whites mounted a spirited comeback to pull the game back to 2-2 in the second half after letting in Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes before the break.  But they were once more made to pay late on as Fred and Anthony Elanga struck to swing the game in their rivals' favour.  ""In the first half we started well and ended well but didn't manage to score. In the moments we lost dominance they scored,"" Bielsa told Sky Sports. ""After we got back level we had the chance to go 3-2 up and straight way they went up and scored again. We played better trying to get back into the game than when we were trying to keep a result but something has repeated that is difficult to resolve. ""We have to defend better. We are missing Kalvin Phillips and Robin Koch was substituted and we could not count on Pascal [Struijk] in midfield because he went back into defence.  ""Not being able to come with the three defensive midfielders we have, there is a weakness in the recovery of the ball. ""It is impossible not to be worried [about Leeds' league position]. We have conceded 50 goals. Do you think I cannot be worried? How can I not feel responsible?"" The 2021-22 season is Bielsa's fourth at the Leeds, the longest he has stayed at any of the clubs he has coached during his long, well-travelled career.  Whether he will stay for a fifth, however, is in doubt, while speaking before Sunday's match El Loco, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign, hinted that he would step aside if he did not feel up to the task.  ‚Äú[The future] is not a subject we should talk about at this moment,"" he explained to reporters. ‚ÄúNo-one can stay at this level if they cannot guarantee 100 percent enthusiasm - that‚Äôs players or coaches. ‚ÄúThe competition will expose those who don‚Äôt take advantage of being at this level.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-can-i-not-feel-responsible-bielsa-worried-about-leaky/bltc5e47c3bb1e8d856,By Daniel Edwards,3191d73c-ece4-46c1-93bd-afaaeb4d54ac
Leeds over-trained comments were 'careless' admits Marsch as he regrets Bielsa criticism,"Jesse Marsch has admitted his comments on Leeds being ""over-trained"" under Marcelo Bielsa were  ""careless"". Bielsa's three-and-a-half-year reign in charge at Elland Road came to an end in February as he was sacked following a 4-0 defeat against Tottenham, with former RB Leipzig boss Marsch swiftly drafted in as his replacement. The American coach has steered Leeds away from the relegation zone, and previously suggested that the squad was being mismanaged before his arrival. Leeds finished ninth in the Premier League last season but were unable to maintain that form in the first half of the current campaign as a number of key players suffered serious injuries. Marsch appeared to claim Bielsa was at fault during an interview earlier this month, as he said of the team's struggles: ""I could see from just watching games from afar, and talking to people within the club, that the stress levels were incredibly high. ""The injury issue, for me, had a lot to do with the training methodology. These players were over-trained and it led to them being physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically in a difficult place to recover from week to week, game to game."" Marsch has now come out to clarify his remarks, insisting he never intended to aim a dig at Bielsa. ""Listen, I want to say this was not intentional to attack Marcelo in any way,"" the Leeds boss said ahead of his side's next Premier League outing against Crystal Palace. ""It was a little bit careless. ""I can see how it was interpreted in some ways that way, but it was more about the state of the player pool, and what I had observed. ""I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any incoming coach that has spoken more positively about the person that he replaced than the way that I've spoken about Marcelo. It's because I have major respect for him.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/leeds-over-trained-comments-careless-marsch-bielsa/blt779788d289168e7c,James Westwood,b37d020f-9ce0-4f42-abc7-3229e2b84de6
"Real Madrid vs Granada: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Real Madrid welcome Granada to the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday evening in La Liga with Carlo Ancelotti's side looking to get back to winning ways. Thursday night saw Los Blancos eliminated from the Copa del Rey after a 1-0 defeat to Athletic Club, while Madrid's last league match saw them need two late goals to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Elche. It has been over a year since Madrid last lost a home league game, with Levante the last side to beat Los Blancos in the Spanish capital on January 30, 2021. Two of Real Madrid's last three home games however have ended in draws against relegation-threatened opponents in Cadiz and Elche, respectively, and the 13-time European champions have often struggled to break down well-organised sides. A home win on Sunday is priced at 1/4 (1.25) with bet365 while Granada can be backed at 10/1 (11.00) and the draw at 5/1 (6.00). It remains to be seen whether Karim Benzema will be fit enough to feature on Sunday with the Frenchman rated as doubtful having missed Thursday night's clash in Bilbao due to an injury. Madrid's No.9 remains the shortest priced player to score first at 9/4 (3.25). With Vinicius Junior suspended for the game there might be a chance for Eden Hazard to start and the Belgian is priced at 6/1 (7.00) just behind Rodrygo Goes and Marco Asensio who are both offered at 11/2 (6.50). Granada's Colombian forward Luis Suarez can be backed at 10/1 (11.00). With Karim Benzema a major doubt and Vinicius Junior suspended, Real Madrid could struggle for goals on Sunday night. Between them the pair have accounted for 29 of Madrid's 47 strikes this season and neither player has someone who is a like-for-like replacement. Granada, for their part, have recorded some impressive results against the division's biggest sides this season, drawing 1-1 both home and away against Barcelona, while beating champions Atletico Madrid 2-1 at the Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes. At their best, Robert Moreno's side are a well-organised unit with two excellent strikers in Luis Suarez and Jorge Molina, and they will feel that, if they can frustrate Madrid, then they will surely be able to cause them some problems on the break. Backing Granada to win with a +1.75 Asian handicap at 96/100 (1.96) looks like an appealing option. This bet pays out in full if Granada win, draw or lose by one goal exactly, while half of the initial stake is returned if they lose by exactly two goals.

'I look back with a lot of regrets' - Why Everton's teen sensation Jeffers failed to flourish at Arsenal,"At half time in the 2003 international friendly at Upton Park between England and Australia, the entire starting XI of the Three Lions team was substituted by manager Sven-Goran Eriksen, with 11 fresh players taking to the field for the second half. Among them, in the 4-4-2 formation, were two debutant strikers, both of whom had both grown up in Croxteth, Liverpool, and progressed through Everton's academy before moving on to Premier League giants. One was Arsenal forward Francis Jeffers. The other, five years his junior, was a 17-year-old prospect by the name of Wayne Rooney. England went on to lose the game 3-1 in one of their most disappointing results of the 21st century, with the only bright spark coming from a young striker scoring on his debut.  However, it wasn't Rooney who netted ‚Äì it was Jeffers, who met Jermaine Jenas' cross at the near post to glance a header past Mark Schwarzer in the 69th minute. Flash forward nearly 20 years, and the paths of two debutants have diverged to an extreme degree.  Rooney is retired with honour as England's all-time leading scorer and multiple title-winner with Manchester United, Jeffers has long since faded into obscurity, with his record for England at senior level forever standing still at one game, one goal. It was not supposed to be this way when Jeffers made his debut for Everton as a 16-year-old in a Premier League game against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 1997 ‚Äì the same age as Rooney would be on his first senior Toffees start five years later. Jeffers was one of English football's hottest young properties in the late 90s and early 2000s.  For the national team's Under-21s, he scored 13 goals in just 16 matches ‚Äì a record that he jointly held with Alan Shearer for 17 years, before Eddie Nketiah surpassed both in 2020. A fox in the box with an instinctive eye for a goal, he signed for Arsenal in June 2001 after catching the eye of Arsene Wenger. Jeffers cost the Gunners ¬£8 million ($10.7m), which was a sizable fee at the time for a young, inexperienced striker.  However, his chances were few due to multiple injuries, particularly to his ankle and shoulder, and the irrepressible form of Arsenal's first-choice front two, Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord. The lack of opportunities got to Jeffers, and he admits his attitude at Arsenal was not perfect. ‚ÄúI was out partying, living life, tossing it off in training because I always thought I wouldn‚Äôt play Saturday anyway,"" he told the Independent in 2014. ‚ÄúNow, I look back with a lot of regrets. ‚ÄúThat is where I should have been putting it in more. Wenger gave me a fair crack of the whip. I haven‚Äôt got a bad word to say about him. He tells you how it is, one of the only managers I played for who did. ‚ÄúHe said there were things going on in my head that shouldn‚Äôt have been and that it was an important time in my career. I am not saying I threw it all away, because I had a decent career.  ""I fulfilled a lot of ambitions but I always say it, I know how much ability I had. I‚Äôm not soft. I know how good a player I was. One England cap wasn‚Äôt enough.‚Äù Arsenal won the Premier League in 2001-02, but Jeffers made only six league appearances in that campaign.  He was on the bench as an unused sub when Wiltord scored the goal against Man Utd at Old Trafford that won the Gunners the title.  He made 28 appearances in 2002-03, but only two league starts as Henry and Wiltord proved immovable. This all came after he had played 60 games for Everton by the age of 20, scoring 20 goals.  Even Jeffers admits turning his back on regular Premier League football as a teenager for a bench-warming role at a bigger club was a major mistake. He said in 2017: ‚ÄúI went from being a regular at Everton to going down there and not being able to get into the team.  ""When you‚Äôre sitting at home and think back at how your career‚Äôs gone, I feel my head was turned. I was only young. It was difficult because I felt Arsenal were the best team in the league at the time. ‚ÄúIt was a tough decision for me because I‚Äôm an Evertonian, I‚Äôd been a season-ticket holder all my life. It was a big decision but one that never worked out for me.‚Äù In total, he only played 39 games for the Gunners, scoring eight goals. Jeffers' later career was the definition of nomadic ‚Äì he played for Blackburn and Sheffield Wednesday, before having spells in Australia, Scotland and Malta after a return to the Premier League with Blackpool failed to materialise. Eventually, Jeffers retired in 2013 aged just 32, after failed trials with non-league clubs Bury and Chester. He even travelled out to Singapore to train with Brunei DPMM, but could not get a deal. Jeffers then moved into coaching, and was most recently first team coach at Ipswich Town. On LinkedIn, he describes himself as having had ""a successful playing career in the Premier League and Championship, as well as representing England.""  Like so much else on LinkedIn, that's not the full story.

Tuchel hit with another FA fine for comments about referee Anthony Taylor after feisty Tottenham clash,"WHAT HAPPENED? Speaking after Harry Kane's stoppage-time equaliser had earned Spurs a point, Tuchel hinted that Taylor should no longer be allowed to officiate Chelsea games. The derby was a feisty affair and Tuchel previously received a one-game touchline ban and ¬£35,000 fine for clashing with Antonio Conte, with both managers seeing red at full-time. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The referee made several controversial decisions during the game, including failing to penalise Cristian Romero for pulling Marc Cucurella's hair in the lead-up to Tottenham's late leveller. After the match a petition to prevent Taylor taking charge of Chelsea games was set up - and it currently has 160,000 signatures. IN THREE PHOTOS: WHAT THEY SAID: ""An independent Regulatory Commission has ordered Chelsea FC's Thomas Tuchel to be fined ¬£20,000 and warned about his future conduct for breaching FA Rule E3.1 during a post-match press conference on Sunday 14 August 2022,"" a statement read. ""The manager admitted that his comments after their Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur FC constitute improper conduct as they imply bias, question the integrity of the match referee, and bring the game into disrepute."" WHAT NEXT FOR CHELSEA? Chelsea will be looking to bounce back from a disappointing defeat to Southampton when they host West Ham in an all-London derby at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-hit-with-another-fa-fine-for-comments-about-referee/blt0e3c727e2353482a,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,70a45478-4643-461c-8f00-b37f2fc5e970
West Ham respond to reports of radio commentator ‚Äòattack‚Äô during Europa League defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt,"West Ham have vowed to take action against any supporters found to have contributed to an alleged ‚Äúattack‚Äù on German radio commentators during the first leg of their Europa League semi-final clash with Eintracht Frankfurt. The Hammers fell behind inside the opening minute when Ansgar Knauff opened the scoring for the visitors. A group of home fans are said to have taken issue with the reaction of radio reporters to that goal, while German publication Bild has also claimed Tim Brockmeier and Philipp Hofmeister were jumped from behind after Michail Antonio levelled matters in the 21st minute. A spokesperson for the Premier League outfit has said: ‚ÄúThe club is aware of the incident and will be working to identify the offender. ‚ÄúIn line with our zero-tolerance approach, anyone identified will have their details passed to the police. They will be given an indefinite ban and be unable to enter London Stadium and travel with the club. There is no place for this kind of behaviour.‚Äù Bild claims Brockmeier had his headset ripped off and thrown to the floor as emotions ran high in east London, with Hofmeister reportedly saying on air: ‚ÄúWe are being attacked here. ""They threw the headset down on my colleague Tim. I have to sort myself out a bit. We have to see that we can get some security personnel here.‚Äù Derek Rae, ESPN‚Äôs Bundesliga commentator, said on Twitter: ‚ÄúThe ARD Radio broadcasters have reported that they in their words 'were attacked' by English fans behind them as the West Ham goal went in for 1-1. You could hear it on air. It disrupted the broadcast briefly. ‚ÄúTalk on air from both commentators about being in shock and they feel perhaps the fans who attacked them didn‚Äôt like their loud goal shout for the Knauff 1-0. They say no security there to protect them. ‚ÄúTweeting this in solidarity with my ARD colleagues. Could happen to any commentator and when you are concentrating fiercely and someone blindsides you in that fashion, while you‚Äôre at work, unacceptable.‚Äù Rae added: ‚ÄúPhilipp and Tim have explained they have been given new commentary seats in the middle of the media tribune now thanks to West Ham media department. They hope to get on with their jobs but concede very hard to concentrate after what happened. ‚ÄúBoth commentators have been asked again on air about their experience. They expressed some surprise about the proximity to fans. They were in the last row of the press area but fans behind them. They felt the fans seemed taken aback by their emotional comms on Knauff goal. ‚ÄúTim Brockmeier said he was struck on the neck at that early point. Then later when the equaliser went in, multiple strikes and his headphones dislodged. They thanked WHU media dept and the technicians for their assistance but unpleasant and difficult to have to broadcast in fear.‚Äù West Ham went on to lose the game 2-1, with an effort from Daichi Kamada early in the second half meaning that David Moyes‚Äô men have it all to do when heading to Germany for the return leg next Thursday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/west-ham-radio-commentator-attack-europa-league-eintracht/bltea9624bfafce71d9,Chris Burton,46dee7fc-b83d-44b2-a7a4-3ef389e6f11b
New Man City signing Haaland buys all 33 of his Dortmund team-mates luxury Rolex watches worth up to ‚Ç¨15k as farewell gift,"Erling Haaland bid farewell to his Borussia Dortmund team-mates by lavishing them with expensive gifts.  Bild reports that the striker, who will join Manchester City in a ¬£51 million ($63m) deal this summer, gave each of his 33 Dortmund co-stars a luxury Rolex watch.  The watches are estimated to have cost between ‚Ç¨13,000 to ‚Ç¨15,000. The watches were delivered by two limousines from Netherlands - including a personal try-on service for every team-mate. Each watch came in a special box that was adorned with three photos: one with Haaland's shirt number, one with the 21-year-old in a celebration pose and another with the DFB-Pokal in his hands.  His initials, EBH (for Erling Braut Haaland), were printed on it, too. Other employees were also given watches from the striker. Instead of Rolex watches, they each were given an Omega-brand watch from the Speedmaster Professional line. They each cost between ‚Ç¨5,000 and ‚Ç¨7,000.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-signing-haaland-buys-33-dortmund-team-mates-luxury/bltb43db9889baf4aff,Peter McVitie,9afe7b92-7565-4c9a-973c-f4be348bb589
Leipzig's Gvardiol on Chelsea's transfer shortlist to replace Rudiger and Christensen,"Chelsea have earmarked RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol to replace the outgoing Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen.¬† The 20-year-old defender is seen as a good option to play on the left side of a back three and is being considered for a summer move despite his age.¬† Of course, he isn't the only target and the Blues are currently unable to properly plan for the summer until the club's new owners take over from Roman Abramovich as talks remain ongoing.¬† The Blues have also identified Sevilla's Jules Kounde, Paris Saint-Germain defender Presnel Kimpembe and Atletico Madrid's Jose Giminez as potential signings. In all three cases, the Blues have explored options to sign them in the past, with Chelsea having pushed right up to last summer's deadline day to try to sign Kounde.¬† Even in Gvardiol's case, the Blues have been scouting him ever since he broke through with the Croatian giants Dinamo.¬† They sent scouts to watch him personally on at least two occasions and have continued to monitor him from afar with their video and data-driven scouting systems.¬† It is thought Thomas Tuchel could sign two defenders to replace both his outgoing ones with Rudiger having agreed a deal with Real Madrid and Christensen thought to have already done so with Barcelona.¬† There remains the presence of exciting defenders in the loan group with Huddersfield's Levi Colwill, Venezia's Ethan Ampadu and Blackpool's Dujon Sterling as alternative options to be recalled to bolster the squad.¬† There are also midfield targets like West Ham's Declan Rice and Monaco's Aurelien Tchoameni on Chelsea's radar but there's fierce competition for both players and the Blues would have to successfully sell one of their senior midfielders to make it happen.¬† Crystal Palace midfielder Conor Gallagher is the one loanee who is almost certain to return in the summer.¬† Most clubs have begun their transfer market activity despite the various leagues finishing off their final few fixtures.¬† However, due to sanctions placed on the club after Roman Abramovich was deemed to have a relationship with Vladimir Putin by the UK Government, they are unable to plan for the future.¬† Aside from scouting and drawing up shortlists, the Blues can't do much and are keeping the majority of their activity in-house.¬† It is hoped that the sale of the club to Todd Boehly's consortium is completed soo. The Government is urging the board and Raine Group to hurry the process along before the licence expires on 31 May 2022.¬† After that, they would have to draw up a new operating license and many within the club think that extending restrictions beyond that day would become damaging for the future. There's currently plenty of hope, however, that the sale will be concluded before the transfer window opens on 10 June.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/leipzig-s-gvardiol-on-chelsea-s-transfer-shortlist-to/blt710d41f3623dd83f,Nizaar Kinsella,b2f2b544-37d4-4bc9-95c4-01c0530a202d
USWNT prospect Rodman feuds with Gotham FC keeper Harris in Twitter spat over dribble move,"United States women's national team prospect Trinity Rodman was involved in a feud with Gotham FC goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris on Twitter over a dribble move in an NWSL contest on Friday. Rodman and Harris lined up on opposite sides in a 1-1 draw between the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC in the Challenge Cup group stage on the artificial turf at Segra Field. After the match, the home side posted a video of Ashley Sanchez leaving Ali Krieger on the floor with a neat piece of skill on the right wing, which provoked an angry response from the latter's team-mate Harris. The Washington Spirit's post included the caption ""Hey Gotham FC, too soon?‚Äù, to which the Gotham No.1 replied: ""Get us a professional field and then we can talk.  ""Until then take your amateur sh*t back to your high school field.‚Äù Hey @GothamFC, too soon? pic.twitter.com/F3kkXz4OAP Washington Spirit forward Rodman, who made her debut for the USWNT in February, hit back at Harris by claiming that no one else struggled to stay on their feet during the game. ""I didn‚Äôt see anyone else fallin like that? U can accept her ankles got broke,"" said the 18-year-old. Harris couldn't resist getting in the last word after Rodman's intervention as she poked fun at her lack of experience at international level, with the 36-year-old having represented the USMNT on 25 occasions herself. ""Oh my bad‚Ä¶ one camp in and she‚Äôs feeling confident hunny,"" she replied.

"Barcelona vs Osasuna: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona welcome Osasuna to Camp Nou on Sunday evening in La Liga as Xavi Hernandez's side aim to keep up their strong recent run of form. The Blaugrana have won five and drawn one of their last six league matches and are overwhelming favourites to claim three points against an Osasuna side who have a very poor record in this fixture. Osasuna recorded a 2-1 win against a deflated Barca at Camp Nou in July 2020, but normal service was resumed last season with the Blaugrana recording a 4-0 victory. Indeed, Barca have scored 36 goals in their last seven home games against Osasuna in all competitions and bet365 offer the hosts at 1/3 (1.33). The visitors, meanwhile, are available at 9/1 (10.00) with the draw at 15/4 (4.75). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the shortest priced player to net first at Camp Nou with the former Arsenal striker having already netted five goals in all competitions for his new side. The Gabonese striker is available at 11/4 (3.75) while Barca's top scorer this term Memphis Depay is offered at 3/1 (4.00). For the visitors, their two centre-forwards Kike Garcia and Ante Budimir are both priced at 12/1 (13.00). The Catalans come into the game following a disappointing 0-0 draw on Thursday night against Galatasaray in the Europa League and will be keen to rediscover the scoring form they had shown prior to that encounter. The last time Barca failed to score in a match had been the December 8 against Bayern Munich and in La Liga they have netted in their last 11 games, scoring at least twice in their last five. Defensively though the Catalans remain vulnerable and their record of three clean sheets in 12 home games this season underlines the question marks that still surround Barca's back line. Osasuna are far from the most prolific side in the division, but they do boast some dangerous attacking players and backing them to get on the score sheet at Camp Nou could be profitable. Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals is priced at 6/4 (2.50) and looks like an interesting option for Sunday night's game, one that has paid out in four of Barcelona's last five league games.

Salah's agent posts cryptic tweet of laughing Liverpool star amid contract stand-off - but what does it mean?,"Mohamed Salah finds himself at the centre of a long-running saga regarding his future intentions at Liverpool, with the Egyptian‚Äôs agent doing little to curb the endless rounds of speculation with his activity on social media. As things stand, a superstar performer at Anfield ‚Äì one with 148 goals for the Reds to his name ‚Äì is only tied to a contract through to the summer of 2023. There has been plenty of discussion regarding fresh terms, as well as the player's salary demands, and no paperwork has been signed as yet to keep the rumour mill ticking over. Ramy Abbas Issa is the man charged with the task of managing Salah‚Äôs career off the field. He helped to thrash out fresh terms for his client on Merseyside back in 2018 after a 44-goal debut campaign saw a new fan favourite emerge at Anfield. Issa has been involved in further discussions over recent months, but is yet to see an offer tabled that suits all parties. He has now posted an image on social media that has got supporters around the world reading between the lines of what his message might be. pic.twitter.com/FVDUbMiH7E The image in question is clearly an old one, as Liverpool switched from New Balance to Nike as their kit manufacturer in 2020. It is, therefore, not considered to be a hint that Salah has agreed the deal that Reds supporters are longing for. Instead, plenty are suggesting that Issa is cryptically hinting at the terms currently on offer being considered laughable. Maybe there is nothing to it and ‚Äì with Salah currently away with his country at the Africa Cup of Nations ‚Äì the representative of the global icon is merely looking to stir the pot before a more definitive announcement on future plans is made. ‚ÄúIf there is one thing Ramy Abbas Issa is good at, it‚Äôs getting Liverpool fans into a tizz with his tweets. ‚ÄúAs the agent of Mohamed Salah, the Reds‚Äô best and most high-profile player, he knows that each word, or picture, or punctuation mark, of his will be scrutinised deeply for meaning, either hidden or otherwise. ‚ÄúRemember the ‚Äòfull stop incident‚Äô when Salah was substituted against Chelsea last March? Or when Abbas wrote ‚ÄòI hope they‚Äôre watching‚Äô after Liverpool had beaten Norwich on the opening day of the season? ‚Äú‚ÄòCryptic‚Äô is how those tweets could best be described, and the same goes for today‚Äôs offering, a picture of Salah sat at a desk, laughing out loud, with Abbas checking his phone in the background. ‚ÄúThe picture is from a few years ago, so what does it mean? Many, understandably, have linked it to the Egyptian‚Äôs contract situation at Liverpool, which as yet remains unresolved. ‚ÄúIs the idea that Salah is laughing at the Reds‚Äô offer? We know that initial discussions have left the two parties some way apart in their valuation, despite what Jurgen Klopp described as ‚Äúgood conversations‚Äù. ‚ÄúSalah, we know, wants a contract that would make him the highest-paid player in Anfield history, and which would put him among the top earners in the Premier League, if not the world. ‚ÄúFair enough, many would suggest, given his form over the past four-and-a-half years on Merseyside. But having entered the last 18 months of his current deal, and despite several public statements in which the 29-year-old has made clear his desire to stay, there has been no progress. ‚ÄúAnd Klopp‚Äôs recent comments, in which he suggested there were ‚Äúa lot of things to consider from the agent‚Äôs side‚Äù, are unlikely to have been missed by Abbas. ‚ÄúWhatever the picture today is supposed to mean, one thing‚Äôs for sure; he‚Äôs achieved his aim. He‚Äôs got the world talking.

"Man Utd takeover: How much will club cost to buy, what the Glazer family paid & who could bid","Talk of unrest among Manchester United supporters is nothing new, with the Glazer family having faced plenty of opposition across their time as owners, but could another takeover at Old Trafford be on the cards? A disgruntled fan base certainly hopes so, as the club lurches from one disaster to the next on and off the field, but it will take serious money to remove the current guardians of the club from their seats in the boardroom. How deep will prospective buyers have to dig if interest in doing a deal is to be stepped up and how much did the Glazers invest in seizing control of Premier League heavyweights over the course of a drawn-out saga? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ There has been no official word when it comes to an asking price at Manchester United, but there have been plenty of reports suggesting that the Glazers would be looking for around ¬£4 billion ($4.8bn) from any sale. The latest global rich list from Forbes valued the Red Devils at around $4.6 billion (¬£3.8bn) - placing them third in the world ‚Äì so any potential suitor would need to have deep pockets in order to get an agreement in place. Chelsea recently changed hands for ¬£4.25 billion ($5.1bn), as Roman Abramovich made way for a Todd Boehly-led consortium, and United would expect to generate a similar fee despite their recent struggles on the pitch. The Red Devils are owned by the six children of the late Malcolm Glazer ‚Äì Avram, Joel, Kevin, Bryan, Darcie and Edwards ‚Äì with each taking an equal share of a 90 per cent stake owned by their father following his death in 2014. Glazer had first invested in United back in 2003 when buying a 3 per cent share of the club, with that stake increased to around 30% by the end of 2004. In May 2005, when buying out J.P McManus and John Magnier, the Glazers completed a takeover worth a total of ¬£790 million ($951m). A loan of around ¬£600m ($722m) was taken on to leverage a buy-out, with that decision immediately infuriating fans as the debts generated were leveraged onto the brand of the club and have subsequently cost them around ¬£60m ($72m) a year in interest. The Glazers have refused to bow to pressure down the years when it comes to calls for them to walk away from English football, but more protests against their ongoing presence are being planned and a takeover bid could be in the pipeline. Michael Knighton, who famously had a deal for United agreed back in 1989 only to see it fall through after performing keepie-uppies on the Old Trafford pitch, is back in the frame as he endeavours to piece together a consortium that is capable of forcing the Glazers‚Äô hand. He has told Man Utd The Religion: ‚ÄúWe are a club in crisis and we all know the reason why. We have an inept and frankly useless ownership who know little about this game of football. ‚ÄúEveryone knows that we need new ownership of this football club and that is my aim and those are my objectives. I am making good progress, continuing to talk to the people, I have got some good pledges and good finance. ‚ÄúWe are now working on the offer document. Remember, it is a hostile bid - that simply means that the club isn't officially for sale. But my intention is to present these owners with a legitimate, potent and commercial offer to say: 'You have run out of road, it's time go, because your time is up'. ‚ÄúWe need to rid our football club of this ownership as they have had their day, time has run out and we have had 17 years of disappointment, really. It is time for them to go.‚Äù There has been no word on who could join forces with Knighton, but Sir James Ratcliffe ‚Äì the billionaire chemical engineer who is Britain‚Äôs richest man ‚Äì is a United supporter and did form part of one of the bids for Chelsea earlier in the year. Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has been linked with a move for the Red Devils in the past, while UFC superstar Conor McGregor is an ardent fan of the club and has admitted in the recent past that he would like to move into football ownership. The outspoken Irishman said in March 2022 after being linked with bids for Celtic and Chelsea: ‚ÄúI do not speak in jest. I am exploring this, as I said. ‚ÄúCeltic from Dermot Desmond, Manchester United from the Glazers, and now the recently up for sale Chelsea football club. All being explored. A football franchise purchase is in my future make no mistake about it. ‚ÄúEveryday I ball. How wouldn't I lead a team of young, dedicated athletes to glory? I'm perfect for the job. Pray it's your team.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-takeover-how-much-club-cost-glazer-family-paid-who/blt30802b1669a811a8,Chris Burton,3d66a823-6721-410b-ba0d-5239741b7d4d
UK government announces five-year bans for fans caught taking cocaine at football matches,"The UK government has announced that football fans found to be selling or taking Class A drugs such as cocaine at grounds around the country could face five-year bans, in efforts to combat violence and disorder within the game. The measures come amid a major rise in incidents over the past year at matches across England, at both domestic and international level. Now, the government has laid out a plan of action as they look to tackle the problem, addressing why they have drafted such an approach. ""Their habit is feeding a war on our streets driving misery and crime across our country and beyond"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said when discussing the new measures. ""That‚Äôs why we are stepping up our efforts to make sure those who break the law face the full consequences ‚Äì because taking illegal drugs is never a victimless crime."" Policing Minister Kit Malthouse added: ""More and more the police are finding Class A drugs at the heart of that disorder, and so we must act. The football family wants every ground to be a safe space for fans, especially children, and so do we."" The measures come amid a significant uptick in crowd disorder, and on the back of particularly ugly scenes during last year's Euro 2020 Final at Wembley, where England fell to Italy in a penalty shootout. Statistics released by the UK football policing unit (UKFPU) earlier this year showed an increase in arrests against the same period in the 2019-20 season, and a 36 per cent rise in reports of disorder at games. Earlier this week, Nottingham Forest's Championship play-off semi-final triumph over Sheffield United was marred by ugly scenes, including Blades star Billy Sharp being hit by an opposing fan.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uk-government-bans-fans-taking-cocaine-football-matches/blt2f5696a545db970a,Andrew Steel,57a8dc9a-5e33-4748-9b84-e19705c0d8a4
UFL vs FIFA: How does new game compare to established favourite?,"The remarkable success enjoyed by EA Sports and its FIFA franchise has made it virtually untouchable at the top of the football gaming market ‚Äì with Konami slipping behind with PES and eFootball offerings ‚Äì but a new rival is entering the fray as Strikerz Inc prepares to deliver Ultimate Football League (UFL). Due to be released at some point in 2022, UFL is set to compete for a slice of a lucrative virtual pie when the free-to-play simulator is made available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles to supporters all over the world. It is not the first to challenge the established elite, and probably will not be the last, but how does UFL shape up when compared to the global phenomenon that is FIFA? GOAL takes a look... UFL dropped an exclusive gameplay reveal trailer on January 27, offering interested observers an insight into what to expect from the game. Unsurprisingly, given how long it has been around and the money spent on fine tuning a market-leading product, EA Sports appears to have the upper hand when it comes to gameplay. Through-balls and general passing details are more refined on FIFA, while dribbling motions on UFL appear slightly more robotic, but Strikerz Inc should be applauded for its short passing mechanisms and more realistic goalkeeper animations. There is not much to choose between the two games when it comes to graphics, with impressive facial detailing implemented by both, but FIFA does go into greater overall depth. For example, UFL has made players more generic from the neck down, whereas FIFA goes out of its way to ensure that individual quirks such as Luis Suarez‚Äôs wrist tape, Roberto Firmino‚Äôs tattoos and Jack Grealish‚Äôs low socks are included in its annual offerings. It is also impossible to ignore the fact that, while being free-to-play, UFL lacks the sponsors of real-life kits that would make the overall experience more authentic. Given the success of FIFA Ultimate Team, UFL was always going to look at putting its own spin on that mode. Player card designs are not as elaborate as they are on FIFA 22, for example, but the concept will feel familiar to gamers and will be a minor sticking point. The main difference when it comes to UFL‚Äôs version of FUT is that it also combines some elements of Career Mode, with player development included alongside the basics of creating a club and acquiring players with in-game currency. As well as the usual co-op and offline modes, UFL is also looking to offer more team-based ranking options, with there a hint of Football Manager about the way in which teams are managed and developed. That is intended to deliver a ‚Äúfair matchmaking system‚Äù, with Strikerz seeking to offer long-term benefits to gamers that remain loyal to the brand. Company CEO Eugene Nashilov told IGN: ‚ÄúYou will manage your club, form a roster, develop tactics and compete with other gamers in seasons to prove your skills and climb to the very top of the league. Competitive, fair gaming is at the very core of UFL‚Äôs gameplay. In this competition, your victory depends solely on your gaming skills and the choices you make. ‚ÄúThis is one of our core principles, essential for everything we do. We believe that our players‚Äô success should not depend on the number of in-game purchases or the value of donations they make, but on their gaming skills, experience and mastery. You will never be obligated to purchase anything in UFL to achieve high ranks and remain competitive.‚Äù Strikerz has promised that there will be no sequel to UFL, meaning that ‚Äì unlike FIFA that is regurgitated every autumn ‚Äì players will not see their teams wiped on a yearly basis and any trophies or rewards will be retained over time in ‚Äúseamless and persistent gameplay‚Äù. United Football League has a deal in place with FIFPro, just like FIFA does, meaning that many household names will figure prominently in the game. A statement from Strikerz Inc reads: ‚ÄúIn UFL, players will be able to create their own football clubs made up of more than 5000 licensed footballers and compete with other gamers worldwide to prove their skills and climb to the very top of the league.‚Äù A number of high-profile players and clubs have also signed up to partner with Strikerz Inc ‚Äì including Liverpool forward Firmino, Manchester City pair Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kevin De Bruyne, Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku and Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. Thrilled to join the football gaming revolution with @UFLgame bringing the new #fairtoplay experience to football gamers worldwide! See you in the Game soon! pic.twitter.com/RwhgcrRotJ West Ham, Monaco, Celtic, Rangers, Sporting, Besiktas, Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Monchengladbach have all been announced as licensed teams. Strikerz CEO Eugene Nashilov has said of how partners will play an important role in the game‚Äôs development: ‚ÄúWith UFL, we‚Äôre building an ecosystem unique in sports video gaming. We are planning to hold special events featuring our ambassadors and partner clubs ‚Äî a hybrid of on and offline activities.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ufl-vs-fifa-how-new-game-compare-established-favourite/blte2bae1249933ec46,Chris Burton,8d472d75-e737-43ef-949d-ef9738258b3e
'I'm very motivated' - Morata confirms Atletico Madrid stay after end of Juventus loan,"Alvaro Morata has confirmed that he will be staying with Atletico Madrid for the duration of the 2022-23 season after the end of his loan spell at Juventus. Morata spent the last two seasons in Turin, having initially returned to Juve for a second spell in September 2020. The Spaniard scored 20 goals in Serie A during that time, but the Bianconeri decided against buying him outright and he now finds himself back at Wanda Metropolitano. Morata has been strongly linked with a permanent summer transfer in recent weeks amid reported interest from the likes of Arsenal, but he still has two years left to run on his contract with Atletico. The 29-year-old has no plans to go anywhere and is excited about his fresh start in Madrid, as he has told the Liga club's official website: ""I'm very motivated and I can't wait to start training. I'm sure it's going to be a great year. ""I'm lucky to have already worked with Simeone and his team and that will make things easier. I can't wait to start preparing for this season together."" üî¥‚ö™ @AlvaroMorata: ""I'm very motivated, I can't wait to start training""Welcome home, Alvaro!‚ÑπÔ∏è  https://t.co/wRNhf8Tdbj pic.twitter.com/9vGr9zGbsd Atletico were unable to defend the Liga title last season as they slipped to third in the standings, 15 points behind eventual winners Real Madrid. Simeone's side also fell short of expectations in the Champions League and Copa del Rey, but Morata believes the current squad has enough quality to compete for every major trophy on offer next season. ""It's a super-complete squad that can aspire to win everything, as they showed two seasons ago by winning the league title in a championship as complicated as the Spanish one,"" he added. ""We have to work very hard this pre-season to be in the best physical condition to fight for everything.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/morata-confirms-atletico-madrid-stay-after-end-of-juventus/blt7da7ebbc5e585e1f,James Westwood,5c3105a7-1ba0-4770-ad02-c8b2e9ff2c3d
'I loved watching Dani Alves' - How Rangers captain Tavernier became Europe's deadliest defender,"Rangers‚Äô unlikely run to the Europa League final is best epitomised by the story of their captain James Tavernier, a player who, on the face of things, has little right to be competing in such an event. Written off by Newcastle after years spent in the limbo of the loan market at clubs such as Gateshead, Carlisle United, Sheffield Wednesday, MK Dons and Rotherham, he subsequently failed to make the grade in the Championship with Wigan. And yet here the unheralded Englishman stands, potentially just 90 minutes away from lifting a trophy that established and future stars such as Erling Haaland, Gerard Pique and Christopher Nkunku have been chasing this season. His move to Ibrox, which came shortly before his 24th birthday, has been the making of him, with his resurgence mimicking that of his club, which was cast to the bottom tier of the Scottish senior game in 2012 after going into liquidation. There have been moments of adversity and doubt, of course, but he has overcome these to become a talisman for the Ibrox club. That he scored the goal that sent the Gers back to the Premiership at the end of his first campaign was just a taste of what was to come, with the No.2 since becoming one of the most dangerous right-backs anywhere in Europe. Indeed, he can perhaps lay claim to being the most prolific goal-scoring defender anywhere in top-level world football over the past 18 months. Last term, for instance, he scored an incredible 19 goals ‚Äì more than any other Rangers player ‚Äì as Steven Gerrard led the club to the league title and denied Celtic 10-in-a-row. Any thoughts that was a fluke have been obliterated over the course of the present campaign. With two matches of the season remaining ‚Äì the Europa League final and Saturday‚Äôs Scottish Cup final ‚Äì he stands just a single goal short of matching his tally from last term. On top of this, he has 17 assists to his credit. Even more remarkably, unless Frankfurt‚Äôs Daichi Kamada bags a double in Wednesday‚Äôs Seville showpiece, he will finish the Europa League as the competition‚Äôs leading marksman. ‚ÄúIt sounds crazy,‚Äù Tavernier told AirSports. ‚ÄúObviously, I‚Äôve had a few penalties and a few moments on the back post. ""It‚Äôs one of those moments where I‚Äôve always said I‚Äôm always there to help the team the best I can, whether it be the nil or for goals and assists.‚Äù It is all the more amazing that he has finished ahead of the likes of Nkunku and Victor Osimhen of RB Leipzig and Napoli, respectively, when it is considered that when these sides dropped into the Europa League from the Champions League, Tavernier was sitting on zero goals for the competition, having failed to net in the group stage. Four have come from the penalty spot, but his most important strikes have come from open play. His ability to get into goalscoring positions was typified by the manner in which he struck against RB Leipzig at Ibrox after 18 minutes to switch the momentum of the semi-final. As Ryan Kent broke down the left, Tavernier anticipated the danger and stole in at the back post to score a tie-changing goal. Such moments have become his trademark, and perhaps his sensational statistics are not so surprising, given Tavernier‚Äôs heroes. üîµ James Tavernier is now the outright top goalscorer in this season's competition üëè#UEL pic.twitter.com/rMEjSWE6pz ‚ÄúI always looked at Marcelo or Dani Alves; they were my go-to guys, even Cafu,‚Äù he told UEFA‚Äôs official website. ‚ÄúWhen I was much younger, I loved watching the Brazilians; how they played and how attacking they were. ""You look at how decorated Dani Alves is, and Marcelo; how they've been top of the game throughout their career. They're people that I really look up to. I always wanted to get on the scoresheet. ""You look at Trent Alexander-Arnold, at Reece James, at Dani Alves, at Marcelo, at Roberto Carlos‚Ä¶ you see very attacking full-backs in the modern-day game now, players who are defenders not just to defend but you're also a main attacking point, whether that's creating crosses, assists or goals.‚Äù Although it has been Giovanni van Bronckhorst who has masterminded Rangers‚Äô Europa League run, Tavernier credits his stratospheric rise to previous manager Gerrard. When the Liverpool legend left for Aston Villa, he said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve achieved so much together. We as a team have grown. We demanded more from one and another. ""But most importantly we‚Äôve developed into better players and better people. The club is in a better place, of that I have no doubt.‚Äù Six months on, Rangers stand on the brink of their first European trophy in 50 years, with the players on the threshold of immortality. Should they complete the job against Frankfurt in Seville, Tavernier‚Äôs rise from lower league journeyman to all-time Gers great will be complete.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-rangers-captain-tavernier-europe-deadliest-defender/blt6bd3ec1fa67cbb92,Robin Bairner,d3e110be-001e-4435-8146-b36a18caa373

'We were brave not to do it' ‚Äì Arteta explains why Arsenal didn't replace Aubameyang in January transfer window,"Arsenal were brave not to sign a replacement for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in January, says coach Mikel Arteta. The Gabon international was allowed to leave at the end of the transfer window to join Barcelona amid a tense end to his spell at the Gunners. Aubameyang had been dropped from the squad because of disciplinary problems and left on a free transfer, without a new striker coming in. Arteta acknowledged that the club's fans may have been annoyed by the lack of new attacking signings and believes it was a brave call by the club. He told Sky Sports: ""We always make decisions in the best interests of the club and to get the best performances from the team. ""We made that decision as three parties. One was the club, one was Auba and the other was Barcelona. The three of us believed it was the right thing to do."" He added: ""[Angering Arsenal fans] was a possibility but I think when you have a clear direction and process of how you make your decisions, you have to be ruthless. ""You have to have a certain courage and consistency in those decisions. If one decision is to only bring in players we can afford, who are going to make the team much better straight away, and who are sustainable for our future, then that should be the case. ""So, even if you are tempted to do something, but you think it's going to bring you trouble in the coming months or years, you should not do it. I think we were brave¬†not¬†to do it. ""We did what we had to do and what was our responsibility as people who are managing this football club. ""But whether it was good or not, we will only know at the end of the season - and it will depend on whether we have won enough matches."" Aubameyang, 32, spent four years in total with the Gunners after joining from Borussia Dortmund. But his final months in north London did not go well, as he netted just four times in 14 Premier League appearances. His last match for Arteta's team came against Everton in early December last year and he was subsequently dropped by Arteta. He is off to a solid start at Barcelona, however, having scored five times in six matches for Xavi's team.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-explains-arsenal-didnt-replace-aubameyang-january/blt9dd72381743dc2b4,By Peter McVitie,4a16f6df-a184-4cd4-b006-ff456941cdf5
Rashford revives Man Utd's top-four challenge as Rangnick's gamble pays off against West Ham,"Manchester United 1-0 West Ham: Match Statistics Manchester United's performance against West Ham on Saturday afternoon certainly hadn't been spectacular but Ralf Rangnick could not have cared less when Marcus Rashford‚Äôs winner went in with less than 30 seconds of injury time remaining.¬† For the hosts, it looked like it was going to be yet another of those games to file in the 'missed opportunity' folder until all three of the manager's substitutes combined to secure three points that sends United into the top four for the first time since October.¬† Rangnick was criticised a week ago for not making the right changes in the 2-2 draw at Aston Villa but this time his gamble paid off, with Rashford, Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial crafting the winner between them.¬† Still, there is no denying that United‚Äôs attacking play is something that will need to be worked on during the upcoming break. They dominated the ball at Old Trafford but, for all the talent they had up front, they struggled to test Alphonse Areola in the West Ham goal, failing, along with West Ham, to register a single shot on target in the first half. Cristiano Ronaldo was complaining to Mason Greenwood twice in the opening 10 minutes that the England international had not played him in instead of shooting himself and again the Portuguese star cut a frustrated figure. But this time there was no stropping from Ronaldo. He stayed on the pitch as Rangnick ditched Fred and went all-out attack with his last two changes with less than 10 minutes on the clock. When Rashford‚Äôs winner went in, the German celebrated wildly in his technical area, punching the air. His gamble had paid off.¬† The win makes it one defeat in 10 for Rangnick and the first time they have won back-to-back league games since he took over at the start of December. It has been an interesting six weeks since he took over. United have shown flashes of improvement and yet, at other times, have looked like they have gone backwards since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking. And while this predominantly toothless display might not have been in keeping with the United of old, the 93rd-minute winner definitely was.¬† The players will now be given a week off and when they return, Rangnick will attempt to ensure that they use this result over a top-four rival as a springboard for the rest of the season. Big celebrations from #MUFC when the full time whistle went. pic.twitter.com/Kt00U3weNn They need to start showing consistency, conviction and confidence in their play because their position remains perilous. They may now be fourth but Tottenham (three) and Arsenal (two) have games in hand despite being only two and three points behind Rangnick's side, respectively. However, if United win their game in hand on third-placed Chelsea, they would be just three points behind the third-placed Blues.  But there‚Äôs that big word again: 'if'.¬†United have already had plenty of chances to capitalise on the mistakes of their rivals this season and failed to take them.  Credit where it's due, though. This time United took full advantage thanks to Rangnick's bold move and that is why the celebrations at the full-time whistle ‚Äì in the stands and on the pitch ‚Äì were so passionate. Rangnick was congratulated by his staff, while the players celebrated with each other and the fans, with even Ronaldo sticking around to revel in the atmosphere rather than darting straight down the tunnel. This wasn't just a huge three points for United. It was a total mood-changer and the onus is now on Rangnick and his players to build on it.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rashford-man-utd-top-four-rangnick-gamble-west-ham/bltcd66097e1b4403b6,Charlotte Duncker,befec992-a531-4ca0-8285-2cfd2a7c34bf
Gotze considers future MLS transfer,"Mario Gotze says he is open to playing in MLS in the future. The PSV star is expected to leave the Dutch club in the summer, having previously declared that he would like to play in England, Spain or Italy. But the Germany international's long-term future could lie outside of Europe, as he would like to move to the United States. Speaking to the Kicker meets DAZN podcast, Gotze said: ""There is no medium or long-term plan, football is too difficult and dynamic for that.  ""But my idea is as long as it is possible and I have fun playing in Europe. And then maybe go to America again. That would be great."" The 29-year-old rose to stardom at Borussia Dortmund after coming through the club's youth academy. He started his senior career under Jurgen Klopp before joining Bayern Munich in 2013, only to return to Dortmund three years later. In that second spell, the went through several coaches, as Gotze was trained by Thomas Tuchel, Peter Bosz, Peter Stoger and then Lucien Favre, before he left for PSV. Speaking on that tumultuous era, Gotze said: ""To be really successful, you need consistency in the coaching position.¬† ""In Dortmund I had four different coaches in four years.¬†It was always a bit of a back and forth.

Tottenham's Bergwijn desperate for transfer amid Ajax rumours,"Tottenham winger Steven Bergwijn has admitted that he is desperate for a summer transfer amid reports that Ajax are interested in his services. Bergwijn initially arrived at Spurs from PSV in a ¬£27 million ($34m) deal in January 2020, and has since scored eight goals in 83 appearances for the club. The 24-year-old has struggled for consistency in north London and, after making just four Premier League starts in 2021-22, he is now eager to move on to a new challenge. Bergwijn still has three years left on his contract at Tottenham but wants to leave this summer so that he can start playing regular football again. The Netherlands international has told AD while away on international duty: ""I'm at Oranje now and then we'll have a look. It would be nice if there was clarity soon. I just have to go play.  ""But I want to leave Spurs now, that's for sure."" Bergwijn also revealed that he was blocked from leaving Spurs after insisting that he would be prepared to join a club outside the Champions League. ""That's not even top priority [the Champions League]. Though it would be nice. What's important is that I'm going to play,"" he said. ""I wasn't allowed to leave Spurs in the winter and then I didn't have any problems. The last few months I was hardly looked after there. Now I want to play somewhere weekly.‚Äù A return to the Eredivisie with Ajax has been mooted as the most likely next move for Bergwijn, and he admits that he may have to prove his worth in his homeland again before potentially getting a chance at a bigger European club further down the line. ""That could be, yes,"" he said when quizzed on the possibility of heading back to Holland. ""It's about my situation now, that has to be different."" Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal compared Bergwijn to legendary winger Arjen Robben after his side's 4-1 Nations League win over Belgium last week. The Spurs attacker marked his 19th cap for the Oranje by scoring his sixth goal at international level, but still says he has plenty of potential to unlock before emulating Robben. ""The comparison with Robben, I'm not there yet, I think. But I can get there, I feel that,"" said Bergwijn. ""Confidence does a lot to a player.

Nigeria are not better than Ghana ‚Äì Addo ahead of World Cup qualifier,"Ghana coach Otto Addo has dismissed claims Nigeria are the favourites heading into the return leg of their 2022 World Cup play-off fixture on Tuesday. After the Black Stars failed to use home advantage and settled for a 0-0 draw in the first meeting, the Super Eagles have a chance of their own when they meet again in the decisive contest at MKO Abiola National Stadium in Abuja. Ahead of the game, Addo has stated the first meeting between the two sides was even and hence the fixture does not have a favourite. ‚ÄúTo be honest I don‚Äôt think we are better than Nigeria and I don‚Äôt think they are better than us, it was an equal game, I think everybody saw and it will be very, very equal tomorrow [Tuesday],‚Äù Addo told the media as quoted by allnigeriasoccer.com. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say that they are favourites, we are favourites but what I can say is if we shoot one goal it hurts more than if they shoot.‚Äù During the first meeting, Ghana created a host of scoring chances which they failed to convert, and when asked if his strikers know how to score, Addo responded: ‚ÄúOur attackers can score, you will see tomorrow. ‚ÄúI think we had some chances, some situations where the last pass was missing, and if we improve that you'll see us scoring but nobody knows.‚Äù Meanwhile, Nigeria‚Äôs Moses Simon has promised to produce the game of his life when they come up against the Black Stars. The winger, who turns out for Nantes, featured in the away game but could not help his side get a win. ‚ÄúOf course, you‚Äôll see me in form in tomorrow's game,‚Äù Simon said. ‚ÄúIt's not all about me, it's all about the team and team spirit.

Chelsea vs Arsenal: Remembering Essien‚Äôs cracking goal,"Chelsea against Arsenal hitherto the mid-2000s was largely one-sided, with the Gunners dominating the London derby both home and away. This changed after Roman Abramovich bought the West London club and particularly after Jose Mourinho arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2004. The Portuguese manager turned the tide of what was a rather one-sided rivalry between the clubs, notably claiming a 1-0 win over the Gunners at the start of the 2005/06 season. This was consequential as it was the Blues‚Äô first home success over the North London giants in a decade. In the 15 meetings at the Bridge since, Arsenal have picked up only three victories, with Chelsea claiming nine wins on their turf. Be that as it may, Blues supporters will feel that number should be double figures, owing to a 1-1 draw in December 2006 that, frankly, should have gone the West Londoners‚Äô way. That meeting in West London did not go according to the flow of previous and subsequent encounters between the clubs with the home side dominating for large periods, fashioning the better openings but let down by their profligate finishing. Games between the clubs in the ensuing meetings went that way, only that it was the reverse with Chelsea often getting the better of their London rivals having been dominated territorially.  Their first meeting in 2006/07 saw Mourinho's side out-shoot Wenger's men 26-13 and edge the possession 53-47 percent. Perhaps knowing his side needed to win to avoid falling eight points behind runaway leaders Manchester United, Mourinho‚Äôs Blues played on the front foot for the majority of the clash and ought to have netted a first-half goal. Their best chance before the interlude fell to Michael Essien, who somehow contrived to toe-poke an effort from 12 yards high and wide after a loose ball fell to him. Admittedly, there was pressure from Gilberto Silva which probably put him off. The Ghanaian, though, was going to save the day for the hosts and preserve what, before kick-off, was a 51-game unbeaten run at Stamford Bridge. Deep into the game, against the run of play, Mathieu Flamini sent Arsenal into a 1-0 lead with 12 minutes left on the clock, sending the away supporters into a frenzy. Arsene Wenger‚Äôs side were seemingly set for a victory at the home of the enemy. The Frenchman was set for yet another success in West London‚Ä¶or so he thought. Essien had other ideas and then some. Just six minutes after Flamini opened the scoring, the ‚ÄòBison‚Äô pegged the visitors back with a memorable strike. Chelsea poured forward quickly with the vilified Ashley Cole - who faced his old side for the first time since departing months earlier - passing to Frank Lampard who found Arjen Robben wide on the left. The Dutchman strangely ignored Cole who was already sprinting into the Arsenal box, while he resisted the urge to send a cross into the area for the anticipating Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba. It's Thursday, so we're throwing it back to this dreamy strike from @MichaelEssien against Arsenal! ‚òÑÔ∏èüí•Describe this goal in one word: ________________#ThrowbackThursday pic.twitter.com/ku3yqELhmT Rather, the wide attacker played a sideways pass to Lampard who found himself in some space between the lines. What followed was truly remarkable and has to go down as one of the Premier League‚Äôs greatest long-range efforts. The Englishman opted against finding half a yard to shoot at goal from 20 yards, instead teeing up Essien perhaps in the expectation that the dynamic midfield man would pick out Shawn Wright-Phillips on the right flank. However, the ex-Olympique Lyon man had other ideas. Essien ignored the obvious pass and took the initiative, smashing a 35-yard thunderbolt that curved inwards, far from Jens Lehmann‚Äôs reach and into the left corner. It undoubtedly raised the roof inside Stamford Bridge with about five minutes of normal time to play.  While the players and fans rejoiced, Drogba, knowing full well the game was still winnable, hurried his teammates back to the centre circle for a quick restart. That winning goal never came, although it was not for the want of trying. Essien missed a huge opportunity to be the match-winner, somehow contriving to hit the bar from two yards out after Ballack flicked a Lampard corner into his midfield partner, but the Ghana superstar finished badly. In the game‚Äôs closing stages, Lampard hit the post after Lehmann made a hash of Robben‚Äôs poorly hit strike and it ended 1-1. While Essien missed two of the game‚Äôs biggest openings, the powerful midfielder netted a cracker that years later remains enjoyable to watch with every viewing. The midfield man scored a left-footed volley in the Champions League semi-final defeat by Barcelona years later, demonstrating his enduring technique even when his physical attributes had waned. That outstanding effort against Arsenal, though, remains his best in a Chelsea shirt. The fact it came against their fierce rivals made it all the more pleasing and memorable.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-vs-arsenal-remembering-essien-cracking-goal/blt7d2fb737b01c6aab,Seye Omidiora,dbb03f51-ead6-42de-9058-1566890944b0
'The biggest waste in football' ‚Äì Ben Arfa's former agent claims ex-Newcastle midfielder 'p*ssed me off' & thought he'd win Ballon d'Or,"Hatem Ben Arfa's former agent, Frederic Guerra, has detailed why he feels the winger never lived up to his enormous potential, citing a lack of work ethic and an entitled personality as part of the problem. Ben Arfa came through the ranks at Lyon alongside Karim Benzema, whom Guerra claims was aware he was not as good as his team-mate at the time. Benzema, however, put in the work and is now considered one of the best strikers of the modern age, something that Guerra feels never happened for Ben Arfa because of his mentality. Asked where it all started to go wrong for his client of four years, Guerra told RMC Sport: ‚ÄúIt's a psychological thing from his childhood. He was king, king, king. He was always told what he deserves but never told to work. ‚ÄúI was convinced that I had a player that, if we worked on his mind, would win the Ballon d'Or. He was so talented. It's a huge waste ‚Äì maybe the biggest waste in football of the 21st century. ‚ÄúThere are plenty of players that were told early on that they would be pearls and still made it. Cristiano Ronaldo became a huge worker early on, Karim Benzema took exactly the same route. It takes work, talent is not enough. ‚ÄúBut his mentor, Michel Ouazine (advisor and representative) told him that talent was enough. ‚ÄúI remember once at Marseille, Didier Deschamps had put him on the bench. Michel told me: 'He's put him on the bench because he doesn't defend. But we shouldn't ask a future Ballon d'Or winner to defend!' ‚ÄúHe said that in front of Ben Arfa... That does nothing to help the boy grow. Hatem is 35 now, but he'll be 17 years old all his life. He's a child. I'm sure some psychiatrists would rack their brains over a character as difficult as Hatem's.‚Äù On the issues Ben Arfa can cause within a squad, Guerra said: ‚ÄúHe's a boy who never asks you for anything but always makes you feel like you owe him everything. He doesn't give you respect, but he demands respect. He gives the impression of sympathy, empathy, but that's totally false. ‚ÄúHe has no filter between his brain and his mouth. Hatem will tell you everything he thinks ‚Äì with force. It's intolerable for a locker room, a president, an institution. Everything revolves around him. ‚ÄúIf he made a difference like [Kylian] Mbappe at PSG... But he doesn't do that with Lille, and he won't do it with his next club. And there will be a next one. There will always be someone who believes that they are up to the challenge of managing Hatem. ‚ÄúI don't want to be too harsh on him because, despite the fact that he p*ssed me off for four years, I was very attached to him.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ben-arfa-ex-agent-newcastle-ballon-d-or/blt16404ff31e3703fe,Stephen Crawford,7efb945a-4ffe-4594-a254-9d4dd1c77139
Morata pledges Juventus love as striker comments on transfer future,"Alvaro Morata has pledged his love for Juventus, despite the constant transfer rumours that have circulated during his loan at the Turin club. Morata, commenting on his future, said he will always be the ""biggest Juve fan"" regardless of whether he stays or leaves this summer. The striker has spent two seasons on loan at Juventus and the team have a purchase option to make his move permanent. Morata was in a positive mood after scoring twice in a 3-1 win over Sampdoria on Saturday. ""I had a conversation with the coach when we started the season. When your boss has faith in you, that means something, because we all want to hear those words that give you confidence and fuel your desire to work even harder,‚Äù Morata said to DAZN. ‚ÄúI am happy because the team has now found this unity and spirit of sacrifice. It‚Äôs a very different atmosphere to earlier in the season.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe future is not up to me. If I am not here next season, I will still be the biggest Juve fan. We will try everything we can to win the league title. ‚ÄúWe are Juve, it has been a bit of an odd year, but anything can still happen in Serie A and the Champions League. ‚ÄúJuve are one of the best sides in the world, so I am proud to be here and happy to play any role that is asked of me.‚Äù Morata has now scored eight Serie A goals in 28 appearances this season - a return that is below his 11-goal, nine-assist campaign last term. Still, he has been a regular part of Juventus' squad rotation, and his buy option is expected to be under consideration.

'I have unfinished business in England' - Danjuma waiting for Liverpool call as Reds search for Mane replacement,"Arnaut Danjuma admits to having ‚Äúunfinished business in England‚Äù on the back of a previous stint in the Premier League with Bournemouth, but the highly-rated Dutch winger says he is still waiting on an approach from Liverpool as the Reds start planning for life without Sadio Mane. There is plenty of speculation to suggest that a star-studded attacking unit at Anfield is set to be broken up this summer, with Mohamed Salah yet to commit to a contract extension beyond 2023 while Senegalese star Mane has become a top target for German giants Bayern Munich. GOAL has learned that Liverpool are confident of winning the race for exciting Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, with a ¬£75 million ($94m) deal being lined up there, but they may look to further bolster their ranks in wide areas and that could see Netherlands international Danjuma come back into the equation. The 25-year-old caught the eye at Bournemouth, registering 17 Championship goals for them in 2020-21, and enhanced his reputation last season when finding the target on 16 occasions for La Liga outfit Villarreal. Those exploits are said to have him on a Merseyside recruitment radar, but Danjuma has told Sky Sports of the rumours that continue to rage around him: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit of a funny story, to be fair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all read what has been said in the press, but I am a quick learner. I did an interview in Holland saying I‚Äôm aware of the interest. They asked me if I was aware of it and I am, as everyone is. I‚Äôm aware of it, you are aware of it because it has been in the press. My phone literally went off all the time. ‚ÄúIn that sense, I am aware of it because of the media but I never actually confirmed the interest from Liverpool because the only one that confirms it to me is my team. I haven‚Äôt heard anything from my team and as it stands now, I am enjoying my football at Villarreal. I am really happy there. We had a fantastic season. ‚ÄúUnai Emery has been fantastic to me. The striking coach has been fantastic to me. The entire club has been unbelievable to me so I‚Äôd never in that way downgrade the club I‚Äôm playing for.‚Äù It took Arnaut Danjuma eight minutes to give Villarreal the lead against Bayern Munich üëÄ pic.twitter.com/EqwjMLAnTk While the Dutch star is unaware of any formal interest from Liverpool being shown in him at present, he admits that a return to English football would hold obvious appeal. Danjuma added: ‚ÄúThere is definitely unfinished business for me in England. If you look back to the reasons why I joined Bournemouth initially it was for me to play Premier League football.‚Äù The Cherries signed Danjuma from Club Brugge for ¬£13.7m ($17m) in August 2019, but saw hamstring and foot injuries restrict him to just 15 appearances in a debut campaign at the Vitality Stadium which delivered relegation out of the top flight.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/unfinished-business-england-danjuma-liverpool-mane/blt4a6dc41a71f8410c,Chris Burton,862c3c17-7460-4fdc-abdf-d949b9c9e11a
'This decision is final!' - Ozil says he will finish career at 'childhood love' Fenerbahce,"Mesut Ozil has revealed that he wants to finish his career at Fenerbahce. Ozil, 33, made the switch to the Turkish giants from Arsenal in January 2021, signing a contract that runs until 2024.  The Germany international was suspended by the club in March and he has revealed that he went six months without being paid. Despite the issue between him and the Super Lig side, Ozil has dismissed claims that he will soon leave as he insists he will see out his contract and end his career at the club. He wrote on Twitter: ""Recently, I have had to make a statement regarding the allegations made about my career. I had completed my career goal by signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with Fenerbahce, my childhood love, without even getting paid for the first six months.

I will work hard and always keep myself ready.  ""As I always say, the main thing is Fenerbahce. With my love and respect to the great Fenerbahce fans."" Until his suspension in March, Ozil was in fine form for the Turkish team. He struggled with injury at some points of the season, but managed to pitch in with eight Super Lig goals in 22 matches.

Ghana coach Addo gets more support as Andre Ayew and Pimpong sing praises,"Ghana captain Andre Ayew has suggested the Otto Addo-led Black Stars technical team should be maintained ahead of the World Cup in Qatar. The West Africans will be making a return to the world fiesta after beating Nigeria on the away goals rule to qualify. The win was supervised by an interim technical team assembled for the two-legged tie following the dismissal of Serbian coach Milovan Rajevac after a poor performance at the recent African Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon. ‚ÄúWe all saw that he [Addo] did a great job, ‚Äògreat‚Äô is small, he did a very wonderful job,‚Äù Ayew, who missed the two-legged showdown with the Super Eagles due to suspension, told TV3. ‚ÄúH had been with the team for three or four days before the game. I congratulate him so much.  ‚ÄúHe changed a lot of little things on the pitch trying to find the solutions and it worked and we need to keep working. ‚Äú[He is a] proud Ghanaian to have qualified the nation to the world cup because it has been a difficult time for us with the changes of coaches and hopefully we can get some stability and work towards the [World Cup] goal with some style.‚Äù Addo was supported by former Newcastle manager Chris Hughton as technical advisor, as well as Aston Villa U19 coach George Boateng and former Nordsjaelland youth coach Mas-Ud Didi Dramani as assistant coaches. Former Ghana striker Razak Pimpong, who played together with Addo at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, is not surprised by the Borussia Dortmund assistant coach‚Äôs exploits against Nigeria.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not surprised about where he [Addo] has reached and what he did with the Black Stars,‚Äù Pimpong told Citi Sports. ‚ÄúIf you consider the work he‚Äôs done from his days with FC Nordsjaelland to Borrusia Dortmund and now the Black Stars, you can‚Äôt be surprised. ‚ÄúHe has put a lot of work to reach where he has in his career. ‚ÄúWhen he was appointed interim Head Coach with George Boateng, Didi Dramani and Chris Hughton, I knew they were primed for success.‚Äù Ghana president Nana Akufo-Addo has also advised that the current technical leadership be maintained for the World Cup which runs from November 21 to December 18.

Klopp seeks Diaz and Jota advice as Liverpool prepare to face Benfica in Champions League,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he sought advice from Luis Diaz about upcoming opponents Benfica ahead of their Champions League visit to Portugal. Diaz spent two and a half years playing for the Lisbon team's rivals Porto before making the switch to Anfield in January. Liverpool will take on the Portuguese giants in the first leg of the quarter-final tie on Tuesday and the coach says he tried to get some insight from the Colombian winger.  Asked if Diaz had provided any information on their opponents, Klopp said at a press conference: ""He tried for 10 minutes but I didn‚Äôt understand a word.  ""With Vitor Matos, Pep Lijnders and Diogo Jota, we have enough experts in Portuguese football, but we did analysis as normal anyway and had a meeting this morning."" Klopp added of Benfica: ""There is a lot of quality and experience in this team. It is an interesting challenge. That is how it should be. I am really happy and I am really looking forward to it."" Darwin Nunez has been highlighted as Benfica's main threat heading into the midweek clash. The 22-year-old has scored 21 times in the Primeira Liga and a further four in the Champions League. However, Klopp says there are other players his side must be cautious of. ""He is not the only one, they have a really good team, a really talented team, but he is good, the next one from Uruguay,"" Klopp said.  ""I don‚Äôt know how they play together, [Edinson] Cavani, [Luis] Suarez and him and yes the goals he scored, the one against Ajax was a massive one. He did not start the last game but we expect him to score tomorrow.

'I was in my prime but I couldn't even kick him' - Belletti on marking Messi for the first time,"Barcelona hero Juliano Belletti has revealed that Lionel Messi was already so good as a teenager that he couldn't even land a kick on the Argentine attacker. In 2004, Belletti was at the peak of his powers and had just arrived at Camp Nou after a successful spell at Villarreal. Messi, by contrast, was just starting to receive invites to train with the senior squad and Belletti still remembers the first time he shared a pitch with the boy who would go on to win seven Ballons d'Or. ""When I first trained against Messi, I had never heard of him,"" Belletti told GOAL. ""[Andres] Iniesta came and asked me if I knew who Messi was and Iniesta warned me to be careful because he is good. ""He said 'be careful' to me during the best time of my career. I was in my prime! But when he received the ball in training, he didn't care who he was playing against. It just happened to be me that time. ""The one-v-one, when I was even thinking about trying to tackle him, I found he had already beaten me. It was simply like that... I tried to kick him but I couldn't. I couldn't get him. ""It was definitely not a normal situation to see a player that good come from the academy and go straight into our team."" As the man who scored the winner in the 2006 Champions League final win over Arsenal, Belletti unsurprisingly retains a strong bond with Barcelona.  He also played alongside Xavi, who recently returned to Camp Nou as coach, and the Brazilian has the utmost faith in his former team-mate's ability to help the Blaugrana recover from the financial and institutional issues which led to Messi sensationally leaving Catalunya last summer for Paris Saint-Germain. ""We know how important Messi was for that club,"" Belletti added. ""He is a player who raised the level and improved things for 14 years. It feels almost impossible to achieve this in football. ""But the club must look ahead with Xavi, president Joan Laporta and their young guys.  ""Xavi, as a player, showed the world that he was different, and I think it will be the same for him as a manager. ""He is the man who the club needs at this very moment. I think Xavi and Laporta are the two right people for the moment."" Belletti is taking his first steps towards hopefully becoming a head coach in Europe after a recent stint as an assistant at Cruzeiro.  Indeed, as well as recently visiting Barcelona as a part of a learning expedition, the former full-back has also met with officials and old friends at Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leicester City in recent weeks and months. ""My goal is to come back to Europe and work here,"" the World Cup winner told GOAL during the English leg of his European tour.  ""[Arsenal's sporting director] Edu Gaspar told me that it is very rare to find players who were involved at such a high level who still want to get involved in this way.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/belletti-on-marking-messi-for-the-first-time/blt16293d379d757713,Nizaar Kinsella,83a3a591-d6e5-41de-abf8-06dc8e07604b
"Part Simeone, Mourinho and Benitez: Fernando Torres' coaching career off to a flying start at Atletico Madrid","Fernando Torres is a World Cup winner with Spain and a Champions League winner with Chelsea, a striker known and admired across the football world. But few expected him to move into coaching after hanging up his boots in 2019. Perhaps even Torres himself, who founded a chain of gyms before later making the decision to get involved in coaching at youth and B-team level at Atletico Madrid early in 2021. And once he started, he found he liked it. A lot. Now Torres is the assistant coach of the Atletico Madrid Juvenil A side (Under-19s), with cameras constantly seeking him out on the touchlines during their games. The former Liverpool hitman prowls the technical area, not unlike Atletico‚Äôs first-team coach Diego Simeone, and is an intense, vocal presence. The 38-year-old is still getting his coaching badges and so is working under Juvenil A coach Ricardo Ortega, but it appears he has license to effectively lead the side himself, given his status as a club legend. Torres and Ortega‚Äôs team are in the final four of the UEFA Youth League for the first time in the club‚Äôs history, and will face Red Bull Salzburg in the semi-finals on Friday in Nyon. To reach this point, Atletico saw off rivals Real Madrid in the last 16 and then Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals, triumphing at the club‚Äôs daunting Signal Iduna Park stadium. They are also convincing leaders in their domestic league too, with some already wondering whether Torres could one day coach Atletico Madrid's first team. Given Zinedine Zidane‚Äôs history at Real Madrid and Xavi Hernandez recently taking over at Barcelona, it is not a surprising vision for club legend El Nino‚Äôs future, albeit not one Torres has in mind currently. ‚ÄúCoaching Atletico is a ‚Äòfuturistic‚Äô thought, it‚Äôs very, very far away,‚Äù a source close to the player told GOAL. ‚ÄúRight now, it‚Äôs unthinkable. Atletico have a coach who is very secure and who will surely be there for many years. ‚ÄúWhat he has found is a vocation in coaching. When he was playing he didn‚Äôt think he would be a coach, but he tried it and he‚Äôs loving it. ‚ÄúThis season he is with the Juvenil side, we don‚Äôt know what he will be doing next season. Replacing Simeone or one day coaching Atletico is a thought which, right now, is unrealistic.‚Äù üîù Fernando Torres ha dirigido en la ma√±ana de este lunes su primera sesi√≥n al frente del Juvenil A.¬°Bienvenido de nuevo a casa, Fernando! üòä‚Ñπ https://t.co/f4U6egA70S‚ûïüì∏üëâ https://t.co/KmxJfcOO4Nüî¥‚ö™ #FernandoIsComingHome pic.twitter.com/YaeMgn4iWc Torres certainly has had plenty of top-level coaches to learn from over his 18-year career as a player. They say it is good to ‚Äòsteal like an artist‚Äô, taking multiple ideas from different sources before making your own concoction, and that is what Torres is doing. His team are defensively solid, in the mould of the Atletico first team under Simeone for much of the past decade, plus it is a trait which his former coaches Jose Mourinho and Rafa Benitez‚Äôs sides have often boasted. Atletico‚Äôs Juvenil team have conceded just 10 goals this season across 28 league games, with their defensive positioning strong and determination to track back impressive, all while being urged on by Torres, who has significantly bulked up from his playing days and rarely takes his seat in the dugout. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs had a number of good coaches: Luis Aragones, Simeone, Mourinho, Benitez,‚Äù a source close to Torres told GOAL. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a bit motivation that Simeone has, a bit of the relationship with the players that Aragones had, a bit of the Benitez tactical mindset, the push that you have to give a team that Mourinho had, he‚Äôs got a bit of everything.‚Äù In his discourse, Torres clearly values hard work. He hailed the team‚Äôs effort, commitment, desire and belief after the win over Dortmund in Germany, although he has also shown tactical flexibility. The forward changes systems during games, rather than relying on a set formula, whether it be using a five-man defence or a simpler 4-4-2. And of course, given his profile, he instantly commands respect from youngsters who grew up watching him. ‚ÄúWe all know the player he has been,‚Äù said midfielder Pablo Barrios after scoring a brace against Real Madrid in the last 16. ‚ÄúWhen he tells you different things on the pitch, it‚Äôs not the same as when someone else tells you. He‚Äôs Fernando Torres and the truth is, it‚Äôs an honour.‚Äù That image is also why he is the focus of attention on the bench, rather than the head coach, Ortega. ‚ÄúThe coach has given a lot of protagonism to Fernando, because it‚Äôs Fernando Torres,‚Äù a source told GOAL. ‚ÄúIf it was you or me,‚Äù they joked, ‚Äúthen he might not have given it. (Torres) tries to put his stamp on things, but always in sync with the head coach.‚Äù Torres started his coaching career quietly, going virtually unnoticed by Atletico fans in his first game on the sidelines, but now he is serenaded by those who attend youth games. Whether they will ever do so on a regular basis in the Wanda Metropolitano, only time will tell - and we‚Äôre talking years. But for now, Torres is enjoying every challenge and every moment.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/simeone-mourinho-benitez-fernando-torres-coaching-career/bltf04cc0ce2de9447c,Rik Sharma,a80c61ec-48f8-4aa9-a1e7-c6f26a9a837e

Man Utd-owned Chong thanks fans for support after reports of being robbed at knifepoint,"Manchester United winger Tahith Chong appears to have confirmed he was the victim of an armed robbery at his home. The Sun reported this week that the 22-year-old was held at knifepoint by three masked intruders and robbed of thousands of pounds worth of jewellery, watches and designer bags. Chong, who is currently on loan at Birmingham City, addressed the report on Instagram on Sunday, revealing that the incident took place months ago.  ‚ÄúGood morning to everyone,"" Chong wrote.  ""Yesterday there was a report that came out [and] as terrifying as the article may sound, I'm doing fine.  ""[It happened] a few months back, so not last night as some reported.

Dortmund stars Haaland and Reyna make their returns after injury layoffs,"Erling Haaland and Gio Reyna both made their returns from injuries on Sunday as they came off the bench during Borussia Dortmund's clash with Arminia Bielefeld. The two entered the match with Dortmund up 1-0, with Marius Wolf scoring in the 21st minute to give the hosts the lead. In the 63rd minute, Dortmund boss Marco Rose inserted his two stars off the bench, with both featuring for the first time after injury layoffs. For Haaland, Sunday's appearance was his first since January 22 as Dortmund saw the return of their star goalscorer. Haaland, who has recently been linked with a summer move to Manchester City, has 23 goals in 20 games this season, making him Dortmund's top scorer. Reyna, meanwhile, recently made his return from his own layoff, which began in September as he suffered a hamstring injury.

'There's an anger inside me' - Chelsea loanee Lukaku motivated to silence critics at Inter after 'difficult' season at Stamford Bridge,"Romelu Lukaku has revealed that he is motivated to succeed at Inter this season due to ""an anger inside"" following his disappointing 2021-22 season with Chelsea. Lukaku returned to Stamford Bridge from San Siro last summer in a blockbuster ¬£98 million ($119m) move, only to flop badly, registering just eight Premier League goals in 26 appearances.  The Belgian also sullied his relationship with Chelsea supporters with an explosive mid-season interview in which he admitted regretting leaving Inter in the first place.  In June, Lukaku did get his dream move back to the Nerazzurri on loan and he is now aiming to recapture his best form in Serie A. ""The season at Chelsea gave me extra motivation to do even better than before. I think in a year people have forgotten what I can do on the pitch. This is a kind of anger that I have inside of me,"" the 29-year-old forward told DAZN Italia.  Despite this personal motivation to prove the doubters wrong, Lukaku insisted that he is not focussed on winning individual awards this season.  ""I don't care about the top scorers, I only think about the Scudetto. We are at Inter, here we play for the Scudetto, not for individual trophies,"" he added. How excited are we all for the return of @SerieA_EN? üòÅ#ForzaInter pic.twitter.com/sxCqbTaonJ Lukaku went on to give further insight into why he decided to leave Inter back in summer 2021 before admitting he no longer sees his long-term future at Chelsea.  ""When I left I had in mind to get a rematch with Chelsea. When I was young I was at Chelsea for eleven years and I wanted to come back to be a protagonist,"" he said. ""After the last game I started thinking about what the best situation was for me. The season for me at Chelsea was difficult and I think things would not improve in the future and so I decided to come back here."" After joining Inter from Manchester United in the summer of 2019, Lukaku went on to net 34 goals in all competitions as Inter missed out on the Scudetto by a single point.  Things got even better during the 2020-21 campaign, with the Belgian once again providing the goals while improving his assists output dramatically to help Antonio Conte's side end their wait for a Serie A title.

Tottenham targeting Everton duo Richarlison and Gordon in ¬£85m double swoop,"Tottenham are ready to step up their interest in Richarlison and are also considering a move for his Everton team-mate Anthony Gordon, GOAL can confirm. The north Londoners are desperate to strengthen their attacking options ahead of the new season, and have targeted the Toffees duo in what would be an eye-catching double deal if it were to come off. Spurs will, however, face competition from Chelsea for Richarlison, and would need to produce an attractive offer to convince Everton to part with home-grown prospect Gordon. Richarlison is the Tottenham‚Äôs top target, and the Brazilian is understood to be keen to leave Goodison Park as he wishes to play Champions League football. Everton sources value the forward - who scored 11 goals as the Toffees narrowly avoided relegation last season - at more than ¬£60 million ($73m), but an official bid is expected in the coming days, with Spurs set to meet with the player‚Äôs representatives over a potential deal. Chelsea are also interested, though uncertainty surrounds their transfer activity at present following the departures of chairman Bruce Buck, director Marina Granovskaia and Petr Cech, the club‚Äôs technical and performance advisor, in recent weeks. Gordon, meanwhile, represents an intriguing situation. The 21-year-old was one of Everton‚Äôs rare bright spots last season, making 40 appearances and scoring four goals in what was a breakthrough campaign. A product of the Blues‚Äô academy, he is understood to have little desire to move on, and the club are aware of what selling a promising, home-grown prospect to a Premier League rival would look like, PR-wise. Gordon is valued by both manager Frank Lampard and director of football Kevin Thelwell. But with Lampard knowing he needs to sell players before targeting new signings, an offer of ¬£25m ($31m) or more could prove tempting for Everton, and Spurs are ready to test their resolve. Gordon‚Äôs ability to play in multiple positions, as well as his home-grown status, appeals to Tottenham. The England Under-21 international is viewed by Antonio Conte and director of football Fabio Paratici as a young, talented player who could flourish under Conte‚Äôs guidance. Everton are keen to sign Spurs midfielder Harry Winks, who could be used as a makeweight in negotiations for Richarlison and Gordon. Winks is eager to leave in search for first-team football, though Everton would prefer an initial loan move if possible. Spurs have moved quickly to strengthen a squad which pipped Arsenal to Champions League qualification last season. Brighton midfielder Yves Bissouma has joined in a ¬£25m ($30m) deal, with Croatian star Ivan Perisic also signed on a free transfer from Inter. Back-up goalkeeper Fraser Forster has also arrived from Southampton, and a deal to turn Dejan Kulusevski‚Äôs loan move from Juventus in a permanent switch is also expected to be completed.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tottenham-targeting-everton-richarlison-gordon-85m-double/blt4167ede07e850a81,Neil Jones,3ca8694e-5b55-4566-9884-a7cc64239a77
Liverpool set to re-open Mane contract talks amid Barcelona & Bayern Munich transfer links,"Liverpool plan to re-open talks with Sadio Mane over his future at the end of the season, amid reports of interest in the Senegal star from both Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Mane is due to enter the final year of his Reds contract this summer, and negotiations over an extension have so far yet to reach a successful conclusion. It was reported this week that Bayern, the Bundesliga champions, had made the 30-year-old a primary target, while a story in Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo on Tuesday suggested that Mane was now a serious option for Barcelona, and that the former Southampton man would be keen on a move to La Liga. Liverpool sources insist they are relaxed about the situation, with talks between the club and Mane‚Äôs agent, Bjorn Bezemer, scheduled for the end of the season. Bezemer has a strong relationship with Julian Ward, the Reds‚Äô soon-to-be sporting director. He was with Ward and other club officials at the recent Champions League game in Villarreal, and it is viewed as unlikely that the stories linking Mane with a move away are a ploy to squeeze Liverpool into accelerating contract talks. Mane, for his part, has insisted he wishes to concentrate on his football at present, with Liverpool still pursuing a possible quadruple. They face Aston Villa in the Premier League on Tuesday, before taking on Chelsea at Wembley in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Later this month, they will contest the Champions League final in Paris against Real Madrid. Jurgen Klopp would, ideally, like Mane to stay at Anfield, but the situation is made trickier by the fact that Mohamed Salah, and to a lesser extent Roberto Firmino, are also approaching the final 12 months of their deals. It has been described as ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù that all three will renew, and in the case of Salah, Liverpool know they will have to break their existing wage structure in order to keep the Egyptian.¬† Mane‚Äôs salary demands would not be far behind, given his achievements and performances during his six years with the club, but any offer may well depend on the outcome of negotiations with Salah. At this stage, there has been no indication, publicly or privately, that Mane is seeking a new challenge.¬† He is happy on Merseyside, though he is, naturally, aware that several of Europe‚Äôs top clubs are keeping a close eye on his situation. And while Bezemer is understood to have met with Hasan Salihamidzic, the Bayern Munich sporting director, last weekend, it is understood that the German giants are not interested in pursuing a summer move for Mane.  Bezemer also represents Konrad Laimer, the RB Leipzig midfielder, whom Bayern are targeting, and sources have told GOAL and Spox that the discussions centred on that, as opposed to Mane. Mane‚Äôs performances for Liverpool this season have been strong, particularly since the turn of the year. He has scored 21 goals in all competitions, and recently has thrived in a central striking role, with new signing Luis Diaz excelling on the left. Diaz‚Äôs January arrival was seen as a sign that the Reds were planning for life after Mane, and Liverpool have also secured the capture of exciting Fulham teenager Fabio Carvalho, a player who can play across the forward line. But Klopp, who signed his own contract extension recently, views both Mane and Salah as key players for Liverpool‚Äôs future. He is on record as saying that both will be able to play well into their 30s due to their professionalism and conditioning, and is acutely aware that replacing either player‚Äôs output would be extremely difficult, even allowing for the impact made by the likes of Diaz and Diogo Jota.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-re-open-mane-contract-talks-barcelona-bayern/blt042fb27a79bce67d,Neil Jones,5a2c3d02-1cc3-430f-9229-49baf6ed173d
‚ÄòFrustrated‚Äô Lewandowski backed to emulate Suarez at Barcelona after three goalless appearances,"Robert Lewandowski is feeling ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù after failing to open his Barcelona goal account through three appearances for the Liga giants, but Xavi is backing the Polish striker to emulate the efforts of Luis Suarez ‚Äì who also endured a slow start to life with the Blaugrana. With a ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$51m) summer signing having previously hit 344 goals through 375 appearances for Bayern Munich, the expectation is that he will come good at Camp Nou. No pressure is being put on a proven 33-year-old, with Barca looking for him to tread a similar path to a Uruguayan frontman that found the target on 198 occasions for them through six seasons between 2014 and 2020. Lewandowski has figured in pre-season outings for Barca against Real Madrid, Juventus and the New York Red Bulls, but he is yet to find the target. Xavi has said of a marquee addition: ‚ÄúLewandowski is frustrated, but that is normal. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same thing that happened to Luis Suarez when he came. He will end up scoring.‚Äù Robert Lewandowski introduced as a Barcelona player üíô‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/XLc19VJZfe Having snapped up the likes of Lewandowski, Raphinha and Jules Kounde in the current transfer window, Barca are looking to bring in much-needed funds from sales. Speculation continues to suggest that Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong could leave for Premier League giants Manchester United, with Xavi using the Netherlands international as a centre-half in friendly dates. He insists that is not a nod towards an imminent exit, with no deal done with Red Devils from Old Trafford. Xavi added: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt sent any signal to Frenkie de Jong. Let‚Äôs see what happens, as there is a lot of time until the 31st of August. ‚ÄúFrenkie playing as a centre-back does not mean anything. It‚Äôs pre-season, and we‚Äôre trying out players in different positions. I played Nico as a centre-back and Raphinha on the left. I don‚Äôt send signals.

A France international forward has committed to a new contract this summer and Xavi is excited about what he could bring to the fold in 2022-23. He said of a World Cup winner: ‚ÄúI love Dembele as a player. I trust him a lot and he knows it. ‚ÄúEver since I arrived, he is making a difference, with 13 assists last year.

Bayern Munich's Muller reveals 'insane' transfer offer from Manchester United,"Thomas Muller has revealed that he was courted with an ""insane offer"" from Manchester United, but that Bayern Munich shut down discussions before it could get any further. The Germany star recently extended his contract at Allianz Arena through to 2024, to likely ensure he will remain a one-club man across a sterling playing career than has seen him claim major honours at both domestic and international level. Reflecting on his time in Munich to date, though, the attacking midfielder has revealed that he considered an exit from the team on three occasions - including once when United came calling with a major monetary bid under former Bayern boss Louis van Gaal. ""Bayern clearly rejected the whole thing - despite this insane offer from United."" Muller told Merkur in reference to a potential move after Van Gaal took the reins at Old Trafford. ""[But it was a] huge vote of confidence from Bayern."" Another potential destination at the start of his career was Hoffenheim, on which Muller added: ""It was relatively close at the time. Luckily, looking back, [Bayern Munich II boss] Hermann Gerland fought back with all his might and prevented the transfer."" Lastly, Muller almost left after growing concerned over his direction under Niko Kovac, adding: ""Since I didn't get the playing time that I would have liked to have in this phase, I sought a conversation with the club about all the possibilities."" Despite penning a new deal for the next two seasons, the midfielder is not ruling out other options beyond the end of his tenure at the club - while admitting that he is relatively laid back on the steps he takes. ""I'll push that back,"" he added. ""I feel good about it, don't feel any pressure and have a wide variety of options.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-muller-reveals-insane-transfer-offer/blt071c310246daedac,Andrew Steel,fde367a1-1a7a-4030-816d-3279ec17def7
"Manchester United have failed Ronaldo by not giving him 'platform for success', claims Ferdinand","Cristiano Ronaldo was failed by Manchester United in his first season back as the club failed to give the star the ""platform for success"" he deserves, says former player Rio Ferdinand. The Portuguese was third in the Premier League's scoring charts in his return to English football, but was unable to break United's barren streak as they limped to a Europa League finish. That is not the fault of the attacker according to a former team-mate, who says the Red Devils should have delivered the squad around him. ""On a personal level he does what Ronaldo does, he scores goals, he wins games and without Ronaldo they don't get out the knockout stages of the Champions League,"" Ferdinand told FootballJOE's YouTube channel.  ""He's scored winning goals multiple times and he has held up his side of the bargain. I think the club obviously hasn't played their role in terms of giving him the platform for success. ""It just shows you that great players, those in conversation as the best players ever - and he's one of them - you can't do it alone, you need team-mates to help and this shows that."" With new management now in charge at Old Trafford in the shape of former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, Ronaldo's future has been the source of speculation, though suggestions point to him remaining on-board. Ferdinand said any impact between the pair would need weeks, and possibly months, to bed in, adding: ""We have to wait and see. This is something we need to wait for and give it time.

'We're not used to this!' - Man City star Gundogan admits unease after shock Tottenham defeat,"Manchester City star Ilkay Gundogan confessed that he and his team-mates were left stunned by a rare Premier League defeat at the hands of Tottenham on Saturday.  Harry Kane's double, which was capped by a 95th-minute winner, helped the visitors to take all three points at the Etihad Stadium with a 3-2 win.  It means that City are now in unfamiliar territory, having last lost in the league almost four months ago.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a situation that we‚Äôre not used to. We know from recent years that Liverpool are always contenders,"" Gundogan explained to BBC Match of the Day after the defeat, which allowed the Reds to climb within six points of the leaders with a game in hand. ""They‚Äôre always up there. We know they‚Äôll try everything to make our lives as difficult as possible.  ""The good thing is that they still need to come here to the Etihad, but there are still many games to go.‚ÄúWe kind of thought we‚Äôd rescued [a draw]. If you look at the whole game we deserved to win.  ""But football is sometimes crazy and today we made easy mistakes. We gave them the ball to have possibilities to counter and that made us lose the game."" City came close to snatching a point on Saturday when Riyad Mahrez made it 2-2 from the penalty spot in injury time, only to see Kane have the final word.

Coppa Italia hero Perisic slams Inter's contract approach,"Ivan Perisic blasted Inter over delays surrounding his future at the club after his extra time brace sealed Coppa Italia glory against Juventus in Rome for the Nerazzurri on Wednesday. The Croatia star turned in a man-of-the-match performance as he helped Simone Inzaghi's side fight back from a goal down to force an additional half-hour before snatching a pair of game-winning goals for a second trophy of the year. But speaking afterwards, the playmaker expressed his frustration over the uncertainty surrounding his future at the club, as he waits to discover if he will be offered an extension before his deal runs out next month. Despite the jubilation of another silverware triumph in Rome however, Perisic was left perturbed over the subject of his future in a post-match interview.

The Blues have said of giving a nod to Bell in their latest home kit: ‚ÄúOne of City‚Äôs greatest ever players, Bell was inspirational for the club. In 1967 he led the team to their first league title in 31 years. ‚ÄúInspired by kits worn in Bell‚Äôs era, the new home kit pays tribute to him as one of Manchester City‚Äôs biggest icons. Here, there, everywhere, Bell was a fan favourite for his incredible athleticism and limitless stamina. He was the heart of the side.‚Äù The new offering from City sees the club crest placed ‚Äúat the centre of the light blue jersey with signature maroon trims on the sleeve cuffs. The crown logo placed inside the neckline pays tribute to ‚ÄòColin the King‚Äô.‚Äù Marco Mueller, senior head of product line management teamsport apparel, has said of the design for 2022-23: ‚ÄúThe new Manchester home kit is a fitting tribute to classic City home kits styles of the past. We wanted to create a modern spin on the jerseys worn between 1967 to 1971. ‚ÄúThe maroon trim was an important detail because this was an iconic colour seen on many of the previous City Home kits. The jersey is a great homage to the entertaining teams of old and the exciting free-flowing football of the current City team.‚Äù Colin Bell‚Äôs son, Jon, has added: ‚ÄúAs a family, we‚Äôre incredibly touched that the club and PUMA have chosen to remember the teams of the late 1960‚Äôs and my dad with next season‚Äôs home kit ‚Äì it‚Äôs a beautiful gesture. It really captures the history and togetherness of Manchester City as a club, and I hope the fans like it and can remember those great moments.‚Äù The replica version of City‚Äôs new home kit is made with ‚Äú100% recycled polyester with dryCELL sweat-wicking technology to keep you dry and comfortable throughout the 90 minutes and beyond ‚Äì no matter the time, pitch or place.‚Äù It will be available to purchase from May 19 at PUMA stores, PUMA.com, the City store at the Etihad Stadium Store and City‚Äôs online club shop. The new Manchester City home shirt for 2022-23 will cost ¬£70 ($86) for adults ‚Äì men and women designs - ¬£75 ($93) in long sleeve and ¬£55 ($68) for kids. Adult shorts are priced at ¬£35 ($43), ¬£25 ($31) for kids, while full size socks are ¬£16 ($20) and ¬£12 ($15) in junior sizes. There is also a mini kit available for ¬£50 ($62).

Afcon 2021: Cameroon wanted to write history but it didn‚Äôt work out ‚Äì Conceicao,"Cameroon coach Toni Conceicao has called on his players to move on after their failed bid to clinch the Africa Cup of Nations title on home soil. The Indomitable Lions failed to reach the final of the 33rd edition in Yaounde after falling 3-1 on penalties to Egypt after the two nations had tied 0-0 in regulation time. The defeat against the Pharaohs ended Cameroon‚Äôs run to win a sixth Afcon title, having won in 1984, 1988, 2000, 2002 and 2017. The 60-year-old Portuguese tactician has admitted sadness after the team failed to reach the final and ahead of their third-place play-off fixture against Burkina Faso on Saturday, he has called on his players to learn from the Egypt defeat. ‚ÄúThe sadness is great especially when we do not achieve our objectives,‚Äù Conceicao told reporters as quoted by CafOnline ahead of their bronze battle with the Stallions. ‚ÄúThe players have worked well, and I am proud of them. It is up to us to learn now and move forward. I gave the best of myself to have the best results with this team. We wanted to write history, but it didn't work out.‚Äù On his part, goalkeeper Andre Onana promised to win the Burkina Faso game for their supporters after the shootout heartbreak. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to live in such a situation but that's football,‚Äù said Onana. ‚ÄúWe ask our supporters and all Cameroonians to stay around our young team. We have to go after our goals. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that disappointment is great, but that's life. We have to regroup to win this third place this Saturday against Burkina Faso. ‚ÄúWe have to try to forget elimination in the semi-finals and think about the future, especially this classification match and the World Cup qualifiers. We have confidence in ourselves, and we must recover quickly.‚Äù The clash between Cameroon and Burkina Faso will be a repeat of the opening fixture of the tournament when the hosts came from a goal down to win 2-1 on January 9.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-cameroon-wanted-to-write-history-but-it-didn-t/blt7d5dbbbbd1daa635,Dennis Mabuka,0ceffb48-aa42-4925-a015-88b4acbf678e
Henry worried about Neymar's mental health as PSG star continues to underwhelm,"Thierry Henry has admitted that he is worried about Neymar's mental health as the Paris Saint-Germain star continues to underwhelm with his performances in 2021-22. Neymar is enduring arguably his worst season yet in a PSG shirt, with only four goals and four assists to his name from 18 appearances in all competitions. The Brazilian has missed another 18 matches due to familiar injury problems, and former France international Henry is concerned about his psychological state. Neymar's latest poor showing came as PSG slumped to a 1-0 loss at Nice in the battle between the top two teams in Ligue 1 on Saturday. Henry, who also played for Arsenal and Barcelona at the height of his playing career, thinks the struggling 30-year-old forward has been crying out for help during his most recent media interviews. ""When you analyse an action and he doesn't position himself properly, okay, that's a fact and it must be said. Yes, he is a little worse than he has been, but there are reasons,"" Henry told L'Equipe. ""Neymar has often talked in his recent interviews about his well-being, about the pressure, so my first thought is: 'Is he ok?'. It's not about that he no longer does nutmegs, sombreros, or about the fact that he doesn't beat people with his pace anymore. ""He talks, but can you hear him? He's asking for help ‚Äì there are things happening in his head, just like any other human being."" The main interview that Henry appears to be referencing is one that Neymar gave to DAZN last year, during which he said that he is planning to retire from international football in the near future. ""I think it's my last World Cup [in 2022],"" he said. ""I see it as my last because I don't know if I have the strength of mind to deal with football anymore."" Neymar has also suggested that he is growing tired of the intense demands of the European game at club level, opening the door to a potential foray into MLS. ""I'd love to play in the U.S., actually. I'd love to play there at least for a season,"" the PSG star told the Fenomenos podcast last month. ""Their season is shorter, so I'd get three months' vacation.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/henry-worried-neymar-mental-health-psg/blt49ccc50c31e743ad,James Westwood,dd25e589-ec1a-4ca7-b195-8e28d47875ce
'We love football as much as anyone else' - How the Gay Gooners and Arsenal are tackling homophobia,"It was Sunday, January 23 and Arsenal had just been held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Burnley at Emirates Stadium. Carl Fearn and a number of fellow members of the Gay Gooners, the largest LGBT+ football club supporters‚Äô group in England, made their way to one of the many pubs close to the Emirates to chew the fat over a post-match pint. However, as he stood at the bar, Carl heard something depressingly familiar: a homophobic chant being sung by a group of Arsenal fans on the other side of the pub. With so much previous experience with the situation, the 58-year-old kept his feelings in check.¬† Later on, though, he would have a conversation with the landlord that would set in motion a series of events that would culminate in Arsenal celebrating their relationship with the Gay Gooners throughout Saturday‚Äôs game against Brentford. ""The landlord didn‚Äôt like the chants but he said that he didn‚Äôt know what to do to stop it,"" Fearn tells GOAL. ‚ÄúI told him that I was happy to talk to the club and try and get some flyers and posters to him which would help get the message out that he and the pub won‚Äôt tolerate it.‚Äù Fearn, who is co-chair of Gay Gooners, was true to his word and spoke to Arsenal. Within 24 hours it was decided that flyers and posters wouldn‚Äôt just be given to that one pub, but instead handed out at every pub around the Emirates by Gay Gooners members and Arsenal staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to get it out there that we love football as much as anybody else,‚Äù Fearn says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nine years old now and we‚Äôve made tremendous progress, but there is still some way to go. We just want to be able to go and watch our team like everyone else. ‚ÄúWe just want to be able to go to the games comfortably and not hear inappropriate stuff being chanted. That‚Äôs the message we want to get across.‚Äù To help spread that message, Arsenal did far more than just printing up some flyers ahead of Saturday‚Äôs game against Brentford. Several Gay Gooners members were filmed discussing their relationship with the club and some of the difficulties they‚Äôve faced just trying to be themselves at games. The video footage was broadcast on the giant screens inside the stadium at half-time and was also put out across the club‚Äôs social media channels. Two giant¬†rainbow flags were commissioned and two members from the group were positioned pitchside to wave them as the teams came out and when goals were scored. The centre spread of the matchday programme featured a Gay Gooners banner, along with the quotes of three Gay Gooners members which spelled out what the group means to them. Arsenal also allocated one of the executive boxes at the stadium to the Gay Gooners as a way of giving a space for LGBT+ fans who hadn‚Äôt been to a game before or who had issues or concerns about attending a match on their own. ‚ÄúIt was a way of people being able to enjoy the game in a welcoming space as their authentic selves,‚Äù says Joe White, who is co-chair of Gay Gooners and who hosted the box on Saturday. ‚ÄúIt also allowed them to get to the ground earlier and avoid the rush with travel, where there might be additional issues. ‚ÄúI think anyone who is trans, non-binary or gender diverse has experienced issues on the tube just because of their identity, so we were very keen on trying to make sure that everyone could get to the ground safely and be able to just enjoy the game as themselves. ‚ÄúAnd I think that‚Äôs what really shone through on Saturday. There were some teary eyes. It was a really, really special day."" It was a pleasure having you with us today, @GayGooners Hope you enjoyed the game ‚úä#ARSBRE pic.twitter.com/CQJSHqGGMT Gay Gooners was established in February, 2013 and is the first and largest LGBT+ football supporters' group in England, with well over 1,000 members in the UK and overseas. The group holds regular meet-ups before home games, organises group trips to away matches and represents the club at the annual London pride parade every summer. Long-term members, such as Carl Fearn, have seen some significant progress made over the years when it comes to making LGBT+ fans feel more welcome when watching their team. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy that the vast majority of the fanbase are behind us and support us,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than just being tolerated, they see us as part of the furniture almost. ‚ÄúAfter that incident at the pub after the Burnley game, a guy came up to me and said he was sorry about the chants. He accepted they shouldn‚Äôt have been doing it. ‚ÄúWe exchanged numbers and he told me to text him if I heard it again and thought his group were involved. He said he would make sure that they stopped. ‚ÄúFor me, that‚Äôs absolutely fantastic. I saw that guy again at Wolves and he came up to me and shook my hand. I really, really appreciated how he talked to me. ‚ÄúWe just want people to see things through our eyes and I think this young guy is an ally now.‚Äù Today was a victory for @Arsenal on the pitch and for LGBT+ inclusion off it. Huge credit to this club fully embracing inclusion through actions and not just words! #ArsenalForEveryone #LoveIsLove #LGBTHM22 pic.twitter.com/2yW0Ny3iNO The overriding message that the Gay Gooners want to get out and that the club tried to share on Saturday is that Arsenal is for everyone. Any fan should be able to go and support their team without having to hear discriminatory abuse or be made to feel uncomfortable about their appearance. So, the Gay Gooners will continue working with the club to ensure LGBT+ fans are made to feel as welcome as possible at Emirates Stadium. ‚ÄúA big part of it is that things like the box on Saturday are not the permanent solution,‚Äù White adds. ‚ÄúWe most certainly want people to be on the North Bank cheering and screaming along with everyone else, but we need to help make people feel confident, comfortable and safe at Arsenal.¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of progress. If you would have played a video like the one that went out on Saturday five years ago, I don‚Äôt think you would have had the response from straight fans that we have had. ‚ÄúPeople are growing into becoming vocal and active allies and we are seeing so much support from other Arsenal fan groups, from Arsenal as a club and from the staff. ‚ÄúI think that is really helping make a difference and it makes a really big impact when wonderful things like what took place on Saturday are done.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/we-love-football-gay-gooners-arsenal-tackling-homophobia/blt4aafec026528fa13,Charles Watts,7cd15aa1-5925-4dc3-bb8d-75d56e0eb5b5
Bruno Guimaraes suggests Arsenal didn't make concrete offer to sign him as he explains Newcastle transfer decision,"Bruno Guimaraes has suggested that Arsenal were never a realistic option for him during the January transfer window, with a man looking to make a positive impression at Newcastle claiming that no offer from the Gunners was tabled. A switch to Emirates Stadium was speculated on for the Brazilian midfielder prior to a ¬£33 million ($44m) deal taking him from Lyon to St James‚Äô Park. The 24-year-old is quickly endearing himself to those on Tyneside, with the South American eager to point out that he was always going to be favouring a move to the North East over one to north London. Guimaraes has told Sky Sports of the rumours he generated before linking up with the ambitious Magpies: ‚ÄúI did speak to some other clubs. But the only concrete offer came in from Newcastle and I really wanted to come here. ‚ÄúI've always wanted to play in the Premier League and on top of that it was the start of a new sporting project for the club.‚Äù Guimaraes registered his first goal for Newcastle when turning home a spectacular back-heeled effort in a 2-1 win away at Southampton that has pulled Eddie Howe‚Äôs side 10 points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.

Guimaraes shares that vision, having previously graced an elite continental stage while in France, and believes he can help the Magpies to soar once fully adjusted to the demands of new surroundings. He added: ‚ÄúIf a club has a project and wants to aspire to the maximum, then it's going to involve winning the Champions League. ‚ÄúIt's the biggest club competition in the world and obviously we're keen on winning the Premier League as well. ‚ÄúThe Premier League is fast and intense.

Ghana captain Andre Ayew sides with Asamoah Gyan on Suarez incident at 2010 World Cup,"Ghana skipper Andre Ayew says he could have acted in a similar manner as Luis Suarez when the Uruguay striker kept out a goal-bound header with his hands to deny the Black Stars a spot in the semi-final at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. His comments follow similar remarks by legendary Ghana forward Asamoah Gyan, who was at the heart of events as Ghana bowed out of the global showpiece in the quarter-final fixture in Johannesburg.  Talks about the famous incident have been revived after the two nations have been pitted together in the same group for the 2022 World Cup later in Qatar this year. ‚ÄúLike I said before in the past, maybe if it was me or someone else, I could have done the same action [as Suarez],‚Äù Al-Sadd winger Ayew told Joy Sports.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true he killed us, he killed our dream, he killed Africans‚Äô dream, and we all have that feeling that he didn‚Äôt make us the first [African] country to get to the semi-finals, so that will always be there. ‚ÄúBut he did it for his nation, he took a decision but we don‚Äôt [have to] look at that. We want to play well and try and succeed [in Qatar].‚Äù In the clash at Soccer City Stadium, Ghana found a last-gasp opportunity to score the winner in extra time when Dominic Adiyiah headed on target, but Suarez produced a goal-line clearance with his hands, copping a red card and winning Ghana a penalty, which Gyan spurned.  In the ensuing penalty shoot-out, there was even more heartbreak for Ghana as they lost on a 4-2 score, making former Liverpool man Suarez a national hero back home. Ex-Sunderland striker Gyan spoke on the incident on Monday, saying: ‚ÄúI remember a game between Sunderland and Liverpool [when I was playing in the Premier League]. We were playing at home on that day and all players were shaking hands.  ‚ÄúI wanted to hit him [Suarez] because people had said things that stuck in my mind. ‚ÄúI was na√Øve at that time but when I thought about it later, I realized that I had to let it go because I would have done the same thing if I was in his position.‚Äù Ghana and Uruguay will lock horns on December 2 in what will be their first meeting after the 2010 incident.

Barcelona 'on the right track' to register new transfers says Liga chief Tebas,"From Robert Lewandowski to Raphinha, Barcelona have conducted an eye-catching summer of spending - a surprising splurge given the club's well-documented financial concerns. Also causing concern is La Liga's stringent rules on player registration, leaving many to wonder how new boys including Andreas Christensen, Franck Kessie and more will be able to play for Barca in 2022-23. However Liga chief Javier Tebas says he has been assured Barca will sort both their financial and registration concerns out to have their new players available - although whether this will be before their opening Liga game against Rayo Vallecano on August 13 remains to be seen. Tebas told Sport: ""They know what they have to do. I think that they still have a bit of work to do but they are on the right track. ‚ÄúAsk FC Barcelona. I can say that they know the rules well and they are well aware of what they have to do. They still need to do it, but there is still some time.‚Äù When pressed for details as to how Barca will be able to register so many expensive new signings while meeting Liga's strict salary caps, Tebas said creative sales of their broadcast rights had played a part. ‚ÄúThey have sold 10 per cent of their TV rights for ‚Ç¨207m. Then they increased that share to 25% which I think gives them some ‚Ç¨350m more,"" he said. ""That would be ‚Ç¨500m and I think they have another, third lever that of around ‚Ç¨200m. With that and if they manage to get some players to leave, this explains the possibility of these signings. ‚ÄúThey have been able to sell assets, which was something they needed to do, and to reduce salaries ‚Äì that‚Äôs what allows them to sign.‚Äù The biggest signings have been Raphinha from Leeds for around ‚Ç¨58 million, and Lewandowski from Bayern for a reported ‚Ç¨45m. Christensen and Kessie have also arrived on free transfers from Chelsea and Milan respectively. Barca's spending is not expected to stop there, with a deal for Sevilla defender Jules Kounde imminent and a move for Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta also touted.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-register-new-transfers-liga-tebas/bltcd4e58e373ae540c,Emma Smith,f4f67029-33ac-4d4c-98e8-6b1cfbbfcf97
Does Haaland's signing hint at Guardiola changing Man City's philosophy?,"On the face of it, Pep Guardiola and Erling Haaland are not a natural fit. One is razor-edged with an almost binary understanding of football: score goals in the quickest and most straight-lined way possible. The other is a man of detail and nuance on a scale the sport has arguably never seen before; a tactician who demands the ball is moved around in meticulous patterns long before thoughts turn to sticking it in the net. On a basic level, Haaland is a man of attacking transitions and penalty-box poaching with a relatively limited ability outside traditional centre-forward areas, while Guardiola demands the exact opposite of his number nines. But that is only one reading. Deeper tactical analysis suggests that Haaland can adapt to Guardiola and Guardiola can adapt to Haaland. The two ideas can fuse to make both player and club more lethal. The critique that Haaland does not fit the false-nine stylings of City through 2021-22 is redundant. Guardiola never wanted to be playing like this (hence his long pursuit of Harry Kane last summer) and with good reason. Manchester City can be guilty of playing too slowly, particularly when faced with a stubborn defensive blockade. With a false nine adding yet more bodies into central attacking midfield,, they have been playing too much in front of the opposition, particularly in matches where they have dropped points against Southampton, Crystal Palace and Tottenham. They need someone like Haaland to make hyper-intelligent movements in the penalty area. These will be useful when the box is crowded and City are 25 yards from goal; after a high turnover when the opponent is briefly stretched; and when City finally work the ball behind the defence at a tight angle, ready to find a cut back. In other words, City often have too many players doing the same thing in the No.10 space, and it is noteworthy that Sergio Aguero was able to excel under Guardiola despite never fully learning how to link the play or press aggressively. There are more than enough City players swarming the opponent to allow Haaland to drift in and out a little. Since Leroy Sane‚Äôs departure, City have badly missed his capacity to break in behind a deep defence, and in Haaland they have signed the world‚Äôs best player at timing those kinds of runs. What‚Äôs more, that movement ‚Äì likely to lead to many tap-ins at the end of long City passing chains ‚Äì will draw defences out of their compressed shape, helping others get into creative positions. It is equally important to remember that, despite popular belief, Guardiola is not a dogmatic coach with one specific way of playing. His Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Man City teams have played in subtly different ways to each other, as Guardiola adapts his strategy to the demands of the country‚Äôs league and to the style of player at his disposal. Famously in his first few months as Bayern manager, Guardiola chastised his players for playing lots of short passes to each other. They had assumed that was what their manager wanted. Instead, he told them to play like Bayern; like a German team. To take a more recent example, there is nothing about the way Kevin De Bruyne plays ‚Äì driving forward, angling risky passes into the penalty area, shooting from range ‚Äì that conforms to the supposed Guardiolaisms. This is because while Guardiola has very specific ideas about positional play and where to pass, this is only the case up until the final third - when players are then given the freedom to improvise and work out their own patterns. Consequently, City will adapt to Haaland. The creative players in the team will love seeing those runs and will feed Haaland the ball as often as they can. They will work the ball in new ways because, at last, they will have the option to release someone through on goal. De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva in particular will shift City‚Äôs playing style just enough to accomodate the 21-year-old. But Haaland, of course, will have to meet them half way. He has been steadily improving his game outside the box over the last few years, recording better numbers in terms of passing, linking the play, and pressing from the front. And yet on most of these measures, he still ranks poorly against other strikers. FBRef‚Äôs report comparing Haaland to all forwards in the ‚ÄòBig Five‚Äô leagues over the last 365 days (across all competitions) has him in the 44th percentile for passes completed; the 38th percentile for short passes completed; the 24th percentile for pressures; and the 36th percentile for touches. Haaland, though, will not need to become as adept as Phil Foden in deeper areas to work in a Guardiola team. A lot of the high turnovers Man City achieve from their hard pressing, for example, can be done by others ‚Äì to then release Haaland in behind. But he does need to do a lot better than he has been doing over the last two years, even accounting for the different tactical demands at Borussia Dortmund. Guardiola clearly anticipates that a young and intelligent player like Haaland has the capacity to adapt his game and learn the ropes. Most likely, the Norway international will do just that, and yet it is curious to note Guardiola has recently developed a habit of chasing star players who do not instinctively fit his philosophy. First it was Jack Grealish, then a late attempt to sign Cristiano Ronaldo at the end of August, and now City have signed Haaland shortly after their interest in Paul Pogba was recently made public. It begs the question: does Guardiola want players like Haaland to adapt to his methods, or is there a whole new Guardiola methodology on the horizon?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-signing-guardiola-changing-man-city-philosophy/bltf7a801f8f83cffd3,Alex Keble,2b1b59f3-21ab-4129-98e0-9bde458b3068
Juventus CEO confirms Vlahovic transfer affected Dybala extension talks as Argentine set to leave,"Dusan Vlahovic's arrival at Juventus has played a key role in the club's decision against renewing Paulo Dybala's contract, says CEO Maurizio Arrivabene. The Argentina international had been in talks with the Serie A side over a new deal, but will instead depart the club for free at the end of the season. The January signing of Vlahovic from Fiorentina has changed the club's plans for the coming years, Arrivabene said, resulting in the decision to let Dybala's contract expire. He told reporters: ""It was a friendly, clear and respectful meeting. We had a very sincere approach.  ""With the arrival of Vlahovic, Paulo was no longer at the centre of the project and we made this decision.  ""The arrival of Dusan changed the position. The technical structure of the team and the Juventus project has undergone some changes.  ""Part of these changes concern Dybala's contract, which has not been renewed."" Juventus previously offered Dybala a contract in October and were set to reduce the salary they were willing to pay him even further before deciding not to renew his deal. ""It would not have been easy for Juventus to make a lower offer,"" he said.  ""Paulo spent seven years of his career with us, an offer of that kind would not have shown the respect that there is towards him. No one has ever questioned Dybala's technical prowess.  ""The parameters in October were different. There were considerations to be made on attendance, on the length of the contract and others of an economic nature.  ""It is important to underline that the management does not take decisions against Juventus, but in favor of the club."" Dybala, 28, joined Juventus from Palermo in 2015 and has won five Serie A titles and the Coppa Italia four times with the club. He has made 283 appearances overall, scoring 113 times. This season, he has played 29 times in all competitions and scored 13 goals.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-vlahovic-transfer-affected-dybala-extension/bltfc24064b31323907,By Peter McVitie,828192d9-6a6a-454c-8338-5f936c3c4f13
Chelsea make contact with Man City over Sterling transfer,"Chelsea are preparing a move for Raheem Sterling after making contact with Manchester City over the forward, GOAL understands.  Thomas Tuchel is understood to want the England international with striker Romelu Lukaku set to rejoin Inter on loan with doubts remaining over the futures of Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic.  No formal bid has yet been made for the 27-year-old, who has 12 months remaining on his current City contract, but he is likely to cost more than the ¬£45 million ($55m) Arsenal are set to pay for Gabriel Jesus.  The England international has yet to say publicly whether he would be open to a move although he is understood to want more game time after slipping down the pecking order at City.  Sterling played more minutes as an attacker than any other City forward last season but competition will increase with the arrival of Erling Haaland, although Jesus will complete his move to the Gunners soon.  He was left out of the starting line-up for a number of big games last season, including both Champions League semi-final legs against Real Madrid and the final day victory over Aston Villa.  Sterling has revealed in the past a desire to play abroad at some point in his career and Real Madrid and Barcelona have shown interest in him before.  After the disastrous spell of club record signing Lukaku, Chelsea are looking at refreshing their squad.  Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen have already left with several big names expected to follow.  Sterling would be Chelsea's first major signing since they were taken over by a consortium led by Todd Boehly in May.  He will lead any negotiations after being confirmed as Chelsea's interim sporting director following the departure of Marina Granovskaia.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-make-contact-with-man-city-over-sterling-transfer/blt31b6f0b78afdc083,Jonathan Smith,59728c8b-1f74-42c2-bf9f-cbc90b72a3f2

"Coutinho drawing interest from Aston Villa, Everton & Liverpool","Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho is drawing strong interest from England, with Aston Villa, Everton and Liverpool interested, GOAL can confirm. Coutinho would rather move back to England than head to his home of Brazil, and while no formal offer has been made, it seems direct conversations are ahead. The Blaugrana, meanwhile, are eager to offload the player to clear wages as they try to register Ferran Torres and set up other moves. The 29-year-old is starved for playing time having started just 13 matches over the past two league campaigns, while his club is ready to move on to other attacking midfield options as it clears salary from its books. England would provide a familiar home and the chance to resurrect his career. A move back to Brazil is not viable at this moment because of Coutinho's football objectives and wage demands.

Premier League 'don't think' Abramovich can sell Chelsea if he is sanctioned,"Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has admitted that he doesn't think Roman Abramovich can sell Chelsea if he is sanctioned as Russia's military conflict with Ukraine continues. Chelsea are currently preparing for the departure of Abramovich after 19 years under the Russian billionaire's ownership as he has put the club up for sale for ¬£2.6 billion ($3.5bn). Abramovich said he has taken the decision with the ""club‚Äôs best interest at heart"" amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, but the Premier League have warned that he may well need to secure a quick sale. Speaking at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit, Premier League chief Masters said of Abramovich's impending departure: ‚ÄúI think the situation has escalated incredibly quickly over the last seven days and he‚Äôs come to the right conclusion.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unsustainable in the current environment. It‚Äôs a welcome decision and obviously, for the sake of everybody, including the fans, as soon as the sale process concludes everyone has certainty.‚Äù  British MPs have called for tougher sanctions against Russian oligarchs such as Abramovich, and Masters harbours doubts over whether the sale of Chelsea will ultimately go through. Asked what would happen if Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK, the top-flight executive told his audience in London: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that will work. I think the quickest (sale) we have ever done is 10 days, that‚Äôs not to say that record can‚Äôt be beaten but normally it takes a number of weeks.  ‚ÄúIt all depends on the complexity of the deal and the number of potential owners.

Phil Foden video: Man City 'appalled' by footage showing assailants attacking player's mother,"Manchester City have released a statement in response to the release of a video that shows assailants attacking Phil Foden's mother. The footage began circulating on social media early on Sunday morning, hours after Manchester City's 3-2 defeat against Tottenham. Foden, who played the full 90 minutes at Etihad Stadium, appears to be out in Manchester with his family and friends when they were subjected to an unprovoked attack by a group of men. City have condemned the actions of those involved and pledged their support towards Foden and his family. ""The club is aware of a video which has circulated on social media showing Phil Foden and his family being harassed and abused,"" a club statement reads. ""We are shocked and appalled about the nature of the abuse and ensuing assault on one of Phil‚Äôs family members.  ""We will continue to give Phil and his family all the support and assistance they need."" The video shows Foden and his family being verbally abused as they enter a room down a corridor. One of the attackers can be heard yelling ""son of a c**t"" and another of the men is then seen striking one of the women in Foden's party. As the situation escalates, a man rips a nearby fire-extinguisher off the wall and uses it as weapon, with the footage eventually ending as the group of assailants appear to flee the scene. It has been reported that the Greater Manchester Police have been contacted over the incident but it is unclear whether any criminal investigation will take place at this stage.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/phil-foden-video-man-city-footage-assailants-attack-family/blt1221b24b27a3e7dc,James Westwood,b139a30d-1a09-4495-85d0-7317472dfe67
'A Ronaldo-Sanchez attack looks good!' - Man Utd star offered Marseille transfer 'solution' by Nasri,"WHAT HAPPENED?

Both teams to score weekend accumulator,"Valencia have scored in their last 19 home league games but have conceded in five of their last six. Elche, meanwhile, have scored in eight of their last 10 competitive games and there should be plenty of interest in backing goals and both ends of this regional derby, particularly at the healthy-looking price quoted. Two of the top scoring teams in Serie A meet this weekend and goals at both ends look guaranteed. Both teams to score has paid out in eight of Verona's last nine league clashes, while proving profitable in 10 of Atalanta's last 12 games in the Italian top flight. Indeed, Gianpiero Gasperini's men have netted in 37 of the 41 league matches they have played in 2021 and can almost always be relied upon to be involved in high-scoring encounters. The visitors have been one of the most consistent scorers in the Premier League and have netted in 10 of their last 11 games, including against both Manchester clubs as well as Tottenham and West Ham. Liverpool, meanwhile, have conceded in five of their last 10 top-flight games, while scoring in 25 successive games and the price offered for goals at both ends at Anfield offers value. The visitors are one of the most in-form sides in the Bundesliga with five wins from their last six matches, while Freiburg have been one of the most consistent scorers in the division netting in 11 of their 14 clashes. Both teams to score paid out in both meetings between these sides last season and should have a terrific chance of doing so once more this weekend. Odds correct at the time of writing.

"What could possibly go wrong?! Semi-automated VAR to make offside calls at 2022 World Cup, FIFA confirms","FIFA has announced semi-automated, state-of-the-art technology will be used at the 2022 World Cup to help aid tight offside decisions and speed up the use of VAR. Qatar 2022 will see technology play a more prominent role than ever, with a new system being trialled at the Arab Cup and Club World Cup in 2021. It is suggested that the process of making a definitive offside call will be cut from around 70 seconds to just 25. A sensor in the middle of the official World Cup match ball, which sends data 500 times a second to determine an exact point of contact, will be used alongside 12 dedicated multi-tracking cameras mounted to the roof of each stadium. Those cameras track both the position of the ball and 29 separate points on each player, with data sent 50 times per second in order to calculate where each individual is on the pitch. If someone strays into an offside position, the video assistant referee will be alerted and they can then relay a message to the on-field officials, with FIFA claiming that this process ‚Äúhappens within a few seconds and means that offside decisions can be made faster and more accurately‚Äù. Once an offside call has been flagged, a 3D animation will be generated ‚Äúwhich will always show the best possible perspectives for an offside situation‚Äù, with those graphics being displayed on big screens inside any given venue. More tests are planned ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which is due to get underway on November 21, but FIFA are convinced that the new technology is fit for purpose and ready to be rolled out. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said: ‚ÄúAt the FIFA World Cup in 2018, FIFA took the brave step to use VAR technology on the world‚Äôs biggest stage, and it has proven to be an undisputable success. ‚ÄúSemi-automated offside technology is an evolution of the VAR systems that have been implemented across the world. ‚ÄúThis technology is the culmination of three years of dedicated research and testing to provide the very best for the teams, players and fans who will be heading to Qatar later this year, and FIFA is proud of this work, as we look forward to the world seeing the benefits of semi-automated offside technology at the 2022 World Cup. ‚ÄúFIFA is committed to harnessing technology to improve the game of football at all levels, and the use of semi-automated offside technology at the FIFA World Cup in 2022 is the clearest possible evidence.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/semi-automated-var-offside-2022-world-cup-fifa/blt81dfc9db9a8deae7,Chris Burton,c0d2b003-b349-4d83-af33-a87e5c93d875
Mourinho jokes Roma let Empoli score because 'audience would have turned off the TV',"Jose Mourinho says Roma eased up and let Empoli score two goals in Sunday's 4-2 victory to make it exciting for the audience. Roma found themselves 4-0 up by half-time, with Tammy Abraham netting twice and Nicolo Zaniolo and Sergio Oliveira scoring a goal each. But the visiting side had a quiet second half and saw their lead cut by two when Andrea Pinamonti and Nedim Bajrami struck for Empoli.

CAF demands investigation into Napoli chief De Laurentiis after 'irresponsible' Afcon remarks,"The Confederation of African Football (CAF) says it is ""appalled"" by recent comments made by Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis. In a statement, the governing body called on UEFA to take action against the executive for his ""irresponsible"" remarks. De Laurentiis sparked outrage when he claimed last week that he would not sign any more African players unless they agreed to miss the Africa Cup of Nations. Napoli were without Kalidou Koulibaly - now at Chelsea - and Andre Zambo Anguissa for a handful of matches last season as the pair competed at Afcon for Senegal and Cameroon, respectively. The Serie A club's owner told Wall Street Italia: ""I told them, lads, don't talk to me about Africans anymore! ""I love them, but either they sign something confirming they'll back out of playing the Africa Cup of Nations, or otherwise between that tournament, the World Cup qualifiers in South America, these players are never available! ""We are the idiots who pay salaries only to send them all over the world playing for others."" CAF's statement in response to the Napoli president's comments read: ""CAF is appalled by the irresponsible and unacceptable remarks made by Napoli President, Mr Aurelio De Laurentiis on African players and the Africa Cup of Nations. ""By publicly declaring that players who sign for Napoli must sign a waiver denouncing participation in the Africa Cup of Nations as a condition of employment, De Laurentiis' comments [are] likely to fall under Article 14 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulation. CAF therefore urges UEFA to initiate disciplinary investigation against him."" The statement continued on to question whether De Laurentiis would take the same view of players from other continents such as South America or Asia.  CAF will now await a response from UEFA who it believes should find the Napoli chief in violation of its disciplinary rules.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/caf-demands-apology-napoli-de-laurentiis-afcon-remarks/blt8aa963301f57752d,Ed Mackey,52790888-da61-4951-add9-2b109cf44843
Liverpool seeking ¬£5m Carvalho deal with Fulham as Bournemouth make loan bid for Williams,"Liverpool are looking to strike a ¬£5million ($6.7m) deal with Fulham for the signing of teenage star Fabio Carvalho. The Reds have made an official approach for the 19-year-old, and are willing to allow him to remain with the Championship promotion-chasers until the summer in order to beat competition from a host of rival clubs. Further talks will take place on Monday, with acceptance at Liverpool that there is plenty of work to do in order to complete the signing before the 11pm GMT transfer deadline. Having secured the signing of Luis Diaz from Porto in a deal worth ¬£50m ($67m) on Sunday, Liverpool are looking to add to their attacking options by bringing in the exciting England U18 international. Carvalho has been one of the stars of Fulham‚Äôs promotion push this season, scoring seven times for Marco Silva‚Äôs side having made his Premier League debut under Scott Parker last term. He is out of contract at the end of the season, and Fulham would be resigned to losing him for only a minor compensation fee, particularly if he were to join a foreign club. Liverpool hope to take advantage of that by paying a ¬£5m ($6.7m) fee now. The Reds signed another gifted youngster, Harvey Elliott, from Fulham in 2019. While that deal was somewhat acrimonious, ending in a lengthy tribunal, relations were soothed when the Cottagers signed Welsh international Harry Wilson last summer. It is understood that a host of other clubs are keen on Carvalho, including Chelsea, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. It is likely that there will be at least one player leaving the Reds on deadline day. Liverpool have received a loan offer from Bournemouth for full-back Neco Williams, and are likely to accept. The 20-year-old is keen to play regular first-team football, and with Joe Gomez, James Milner and the up-and-coming Conor Bradley all able to play right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold is unavailable or in need of a rest, Liverpool feel they are able to loan Williams out. Offers may well arrive for Takumi Minamino, Divock Origi and Nat Phillips too, although GOAL understands Minamino is desperate to remain at Anfield until the end of the season. Initial approaches from both Leeds and Monaco have been rejected. Phillips meanwhile faces another uncertain deadline day, with interest from Brighton, Watford, Newcastle and Burnley all dependent on what happens elsewhere - Newcastle‚Äôs bid for Dan Burn, for example.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-carvalho-fulham-bournemouth-loan-williams/blt588154d7a51db146,Neil Jones,1ff5b7a6-ee89-4ff8-a25e-6b2987d04001
'I didn't touch the ball for 25 minutes!' - Haaland admits Man City are a 'different level' to Dortmund as he recalls Champions League struggles,"New Manchester City signing Erling Haaland acknowledges that he will have to step up his game at the Premier League champions, who gave the forward a torrid evening the last time they met.  Haaland arrives at the Etihad Stadium as one of the world's elite goalscorers after two and a half incredible seasons with Dortmund.  But he is aware that record will count for little unless he can shine alongside his illustrious new team-mates. ""It is a big challenge, it is a new country, a new league, new coach, new everything so it is a big challenge but I know how it is to come to a new club, I have done it a couple of times before. I am really looking forward to it,"" the Norwegian told reporters at Sunday's press conference. ""I played against them in the Champions League last year and you see something on TV and then when you meet it is completely different. ""I didn‚Äôt touch the ball for 25 minutes and it is like, [Ilkay] Gundogan, please stop playing tiki-taka! ""It is a different level how they play and that is what I want to be a part of. ""What am I looking to improve? Everything, headers, shooting, left foot, right foot, movement, with the ball, off the ball."" While still just 21, Haaland has become a superstar thanks to his prodigious ability in front of the net.  He made his senior debut for second-tier Norwegian side Bryne aged just 15 and swiftly earned a move to Molde, from where he was snapped up by Red Bull Salzburg in January 2019, still six months short of his 19th birthday.  The goals kept coming in Austria too, and after less than a year at Red Bull and 29 strikes in 27 games, Dortmund won the race for his signature, taking him to the Bundesliga in 2020.  That step up in quality did not slow Haaland's amazing strike-rate, netting 86 in 89 outings during his time with BVB; and City will hope he can adapt just as seamlessly to his new surroundings after spending ¬£51 million ($63m) to bring him to the Premer League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/i-didn-t-touch-the-ball-for-25-minutes-haaland-admits-man/bltf9f7aacc87ce9e43,Daniel Edwards,61b0fa42-9d1d-4894-bf7d-d553b98dc06e

De Bruyne's Haaland impression moves Man City one step closer to Premier League title,"Match Statistics: Wolves 1-5 Manchester City Arms outstretched and finger curled in a zen pose, Kevin De Bruyne celebration was an attempt to imitate Manchester City's summer signing Erling Haaland. It wasn't his best impression of the Norwegian international in Wednesday night's 5-1 win at Wolves. That came in the preceding 24 minutes when he smashed an incredible hat-trick that moved Pep Guardiola's side to within four points of a fourth Premier League title in five years. There was even time for a fourth and a goal for Raheem Sterling to boost City's goal difference and eke out every advantage they could in the title race. The thought of Haaland and De Bruyne together must be terrifying the rest of the Premier League after the club confirmed the 21-year-old striker will join from Borussia Dortmund. City will be pairing the deadliest young striker in Europe with probably the most brilliantly creative attacking midfielder of the past five years. But we will have to wait a little bit longer for that. For now, De Bruyne decided to take on both roles with an astonishing performance in a potentially dangerous visit to Wolves, where any slip-up would have given Liverpool encouragement for the final 10 days of the season. It only took Kevin De Bruyne 24 minutes to score a hat-trick ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/QUWzR3Lsm5 Power, precision and remarkable finishing, this was exactly the sort of performance they will hope to get from Haaland when he joins up with the club next season. Of course, De Bruyne's incredible passing game was still there, as the Belgian picked out a delicious pass for Phil Foden inside the opening few minutes that drifted just wide. But then he decided to do the damage himself with the third fastest hat-trick in Premier League history ‚Äì and few even over 90 minutes will have had as much quality. The first inside seven minutes was a driving run into the box followed by a fierce clinical shot across goalkeeper Jose Sa. Then, De Bruyne's first-time pass picked out Sterling nine minutes later, and when the ball rebounded off the keeper, he smashed in a second. His third was just a brutal clubbing shot from the edge of the box that powered past Sa before he could properly react. De Bruyne tested out his borrowed goal celebration in front of the delighted away fans ‚Äì Foden just smiled and shook his head in disbelief as he patted his team-mate after a stunning contribution. Kevin De Bruyne is inevitable üò§ pic.twitter.com/3RmmSNCScN With a defensive crisis pressing 37-year-old midfielder Fernandinho into an emergency centre-back role, City's best route to victory was always attacking. Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte had got into a mess in the 11th minute that had led to Leander Dendoncker snatching an equaliser. But the punishing performance from De Bruyne took all the pressure off. Just seven days ago in the heartbreak of the Champions League defeat to Real Madrid, many were questioning the 30-year-old. It was an admittedly disappointing and off-night but he, along with City have given the perfect response. Guardiola's side are now three points clear in a week when they've made a signing that many regard as potentially the most iconic in the club's history ‚Äì beating Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich to Haaland's signature.

"Man Utd are one of the best teams in the world right now, says Atletico Madrid boss Simeone","Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has insisted that Manchester United are ""one of the best teams in the world"" right now ahead of their last-16 Champions League tie. United will arrive at Wanda Metropolitano for the first leg on Wednesday night on the back of a confidence-boosting 4-2 victory at Leeds. That result saw Ralf Rangnick's side tighten their grip on fourth place in the Premier League, and Simeone is expecting a tough test for his team in front of their own fans. The Red Devils struggled for consistency in the first half of the season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but Simeone is wary of how far they have come in a short space of time under Rangnick. ""We're facing one of the best teams in the world in the last 14 games, if I'm not mistaken,"" the Argentine told a pre-match press conference. ""They've just lost one. With the new manager, Ralf Rangnick, it's given the team solidity, teamwork, commitment. ""We can see what Manchester United was always like. They've evolved since the new manager arrived, they're already fourth in the league. ""It's an intense, dynamic team, very brave, with very good forwards, very good footballers overall and who try to make a huge effort to try and unite the huge talents they have in 11 players. ""It's going to be a very difficult game, as every Champions League game is. But we have a lot of anticipation to play in our stadium in front of our fans and we're lucky to play the last 16 at home because we couldn't play that, we couldn't do that last year."" The Red Devils have played a total of 15 games across all competitions under Rangnick to date, posting eight wins, five draws and just two losses. A 1-0 home defeat to Wolves and a penalty shootout loss to Middlesbrough in the fourth round of the FA Cup are the only black marks on the interim manager's record so far, with United now looking a more solid, well-rounded outfit. Simeone has been impressed by the changes Rangnick has managed to implement, but he will have his own plan ready to try and breach their stubborn rearguard in the Spanish capital. ""The team is much more compact, it's stronger,"" the Atletico chief added. ""They have a solidity at the back, they're a very physical team with the central defenders and the midfield they've got. ""They are really strong and it's really, really difficult to find vulnerabilities there. I always assess the virtues of our rival, but of course, we will try to find a way to try and hurt them, try and find our way to the goal, if you like.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-one-best-teams-world-right-now-atletico-madrid-boss/bltf9ba721ef329f527,James Westwood,28a138ab-bc14-403a-beec-0e99809d3674
'I was sh*tting myself!' - Pedri on nutmeg that still has Barcelona buzzing,"Barcelona wonderkid Pedri admitted that he was scared he would end up looking like a fool even as he pulled off a remarkable nutmeg during his team's thrashing of Athletic Club on Sunday.  The 19-year-old left Mikel Balenziaga standing with an exquisite piece of skill at Camp Nou as Barca raced to a 4-0 win.  It was reminiscent of one Juan Roman Riquelme, who humiliated Colombia hardman Mario Yepes with an almost identical trick when the then-Boca Juniors and River Plate stars found themselves on opposing sides of the 2000 Superclasico in Argentina.  ""On a personal level I'm feeling really good, I enjoy having the ball at my feet,"" the youngster told Movistar after the game.  ""With the nutmeg I was sh*tting myself that it wouldn't work, but it came off!""  Nothing to see here pic.twitter.com/kjSQeQnkTq Barca coach Xavi was also delighted to see his young charge strut his stuff, while pointing out there was far more to his game than tricks.  ""It's not just the nutmeg, it's his understanding of football that stands out.

"Huddersfield vs Stoke: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Huddersfield are looking to strengthen their hold on a promotion play-off place when they take on Stoke in the Championship on Friday. The home side are sixth in the English second tier and on a nine-game winning run heading into the clash with Michael O'Neill‚Äôs side, who are still in contention for a play-off place. Huddersfield are slight favourites for this tie, available at 31/20 (2.55) with bet365 to win this contest. Stoke, who have lost their last two matches in the league, are 9/5 (2.8) to get the three points. The two teams sharing the points on Friday night is available at 9/4 (3.25). Huddersfield striker Jordan Rhodes is available at 6/1 (7.0) to score the first goal of the game. Sam Surridge of Stoke can be backed at 13/2 (7.5) to break the deadlock. Stoke have a fantastic record against Friday's opponents, having won five and drawn two of the eight matches they have played in just over four years.  It is Huddersfield, however, who are in the best shape heading into Friday evening's encounter. Their eight-game unbeaten run in the Championship turned them into strong contenders to reach the play-offs. Stoke, on the other hand, have plummeted down the table with just one win from six Championship games.  Both sides have some injury troubles to contend with.  For the hosts, on-loan centre-back Levi Colwill and Ryan Schofield are unavailable, as are longer-term absentees Rolando Aarons and Alex Vallejo.  Stoke goalkeeper Josef Bursik is still out, while Harry Souttar and Romaine Sawyers are also missing through injury. Nick Powell, Joe Allen and Tyrese Campbell could return to the side, however.  Given the difference in form between these two teams and Huddersfield's penchant for finding the net in recent weeks, odds of 6/5 (2.2) for there being more than 2.5 goals in this game look like good value.

Tottenham set to make Richarlison offer as Everton star eyes Champions League football,"Tottenham Hotspur are expected to submit a bid for Everton star Richarlison in the coming days, GOAL understands. The north London team hope to meet with the striker's agents to discuss a deal for the 25-year-old. Richarlison has been linked with a move away from Goodison Park after four years with the Toffees, with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich said to be after him. The centre-forwards agents are set to meet with the Spurs board and the Premier League team plans on making a formal offer to Everton this month. Richarlison wants to have sorted out his future after his holiday in Brazil comes to an end and he may be attracted to joining Antonio Conte's team due to Tottenham's involvement in next season's Champions League, as the Brazil international dreams of playing, as in Europe's premier club competition. Everton have not declared how much they will demand for the 25-year-old, but they are aware of his desire to leave for one of Europe's top teams. The attacker joined Tottenham from Watford in 2018, just a year after his arrival in England from Fluminense. He has made 152 appearances for the Merseyside club in all competitions, scoring 53 goals.

"'Pep puts enough pressure on himself' - No rush on new contract for Man City manager, insists chairman Khaldoon","Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has said there's no rush on getting manager Pep Guardiola to sign a contract extension. Guardiola's current deal runs until the end of next season, and he has said he won't consider a new deal until 2023. Despite winning the Premier League again this term, pressure is mounting on Guardiola to lead Manchester City to a Champions League triumph. ""You don‚Äôt need to put any extra pressure on Pep, he puts enough pressure on himself for everyone,"" the chairman told the club website. ""It is the exact opposite I try to bring back the pressure because I think he puts too much pressure on himself. The pressure is not of winning this competition or that competition. We are all in it together.  ""[Owner] Sheikh Mansour looks at the game understands the game and understands winning and losing very very well which is why his ethos, his philosophy I have tried to instil on this organisation and what we have had these last games which is positive constructive forward leaning, always pushing forward.  ""We approach every season to win and to try to win every competition we compete in. That is the mindset that has been the case over the last 10 years. ""We try to win every competition we play and I think part if when you are asking about Pep you cannot argue every competition from the Champions League to the Premier League to the FA Cup. We show up every game with full intention to give it everything we have to win every game. With that you can see the results."" Khaldoon added on Guardiola: ""Pep has never stayed as long as he's stayed here with any club, be it Barcelona or Bayern Munich. So, the question is perfectly valid. ""It is perfectly valid last year and three years ago, and of course this year. It is a partnership that has done wonders in years.  ""It is approaching its seventh year and next year is going to be an exciting chapter of his partnership and we're enjoying every moment of it. We're achieving great things together and this conversation will be had at the right time, at the right pace, and with the pace, time and framework that works for Pep."" The club have already announced the signings of Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland, but additional incomings are still expected. ""We've been very deliberate over the years in how we freshen up the squad, how we continuously improve the team very deliberately and then how we infuse it with talent from the academy,"" said Khaldoon. ""I can confirm that there will be more players coming in. We are looking to strengthen the team in the areas we need strengthening. ""Every season some players leave and we have to refresh the team.

The Milan supremo believes teams will adapt however, including his own, adding: ""We need to get used to it. We got used to Covid-19, suspended games and behind closed doors, so we need to get accustomed. ""This season will be divided into two and we need to see it as such.

Ziyech: Morocco open door for Chelsea winger to return to squad,"Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has confirmed the door for the national team is wide open for Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech ahead of the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar. The 29-year-old has on two occasions turned down a call to feature for the Atlas Lions, the latest coming in the 2022 World Cup play-offs against the Democratic Republic of Congo a month ago. Despite earning a call to join the provisional squad named by coach Vahid Halilhodzic, the Chelsea player alongside Ajax defender Noussair Mazraoui turned it down saying he was concentrating on club duties. However, FMRF president Fouzi Lekjaa has said nobody can stop a Moroccan player from playing for the national team. ‚ÄúThe doors of the national team are open to all Moroccan players, regardless of their differences,‚Äù FMRF president Lekjaa said during a board meeting this week as quoted by BBC Sport Africa. ‚ÄúNobody can stop a Moroccan player playing for the national team, whether it‚Äôs Ziyech or anyone else.‚Äù On turning down the call to face DR Congo, a two-legged fixture they won 5-2 on aggregate to qualify for the finaL, Ziyech said then: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to disappoint the fans, it was not an easy decision to make, but unfortunately, I feel I have no other choice. ‚ÄúAlthough I have given my all for the team over the past six years, the leaders continue to spread false information about me and my commitment to my country.

Son Heung-min celebration: What is the meaning behind Tottenham star's camera gesture?,"Son Heung-min has carved out a reputation as not only one of the Premier League's most prolific forwards, but as one of the top-flight's nicest people as well - and it is rare to see him unsmiling. The South Korea international has formed a formidable strike partnership with team-mate Harry Kane, and is one of the most important members of the Tottenham team. You might be familiar with the camera celebration Son does right after he scores a goal - but what is the significance of it? GOAL takes a look. After Son hits the ball into the net, he often celebrates in the direction of the camera, shaping his fingers into the motion of pretending to take a picture with a camera. Paired with his signature grin, it is a trademark celebration of the Tottenham forward. Son explained his reasoning behind the celebration in an interview with Sky Sports, and the meaning behind his special camera celebration is incredibly wholesome. ""Maybe a year ago, I was thinking about what could be a special celebration,"" Son said.

And then when¬†asked about why he is so happy and smiling all the time, Son said: ""It's because I love football. I love being here, and playing with my team-mates and with this amazing team."" Son, who joined Spurs in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen, is well past a century of goals for the club and has impressed under a succession of managers in north London.

"'He was the best we had' - Grealish sale has affected Aston Villa this season, admits Martinez","Emi Martinez admits Aston Villa's record-breaking ¬£100 million ($127m) sale of Jack Grealish to Manchester City has impacted the club's performances this season as the Villans were forced to part with ‚Äúthe best we had‚Äù. The home-grown captain bid farewell to his West Midlands roots in the summer of 2021 when becoming the most expensive player in British football. His absence was always going to be felt at Villa Park, despite much of the fee he generated being reinvested on new recruits, and Martinez admits his side have struggled for consistency after losing a key creative influence and on-field leader. After helping Villa secure promotion back into the Premier League in 2019, Grealish registered 17 goals and 18 assists across two seasons. With those qualities now aiding the cause of reigning English champions, Martinez said: ‚ÄúHe was the best player we had. He was outstanding last season but we understood he needed to make that step. The signings we made were really positive but they needed time to adapt. ‚ÄúYou can see now at the end of the season the inconsistency as well because we have a new manager, a new philosophy. Next season, we will know what to do. ‚ÄúIt has been difficult inside (the club) but we have been very positive and we have double figures in clean sheets now.‚Äù Jack Grealish's transformation at Aston Villa was crazy üí™ pic.twitter.com/3CM09PuUfa Martinez added: ‚ÄúObviously there has been investment at the club and everyone expected us to be top eight or top seven but it is difficult when there are so many changes in one season. We have been inconsistent but we have to realise we sold Jack, a home-grown player and the best we had at Villa. ‚ÄúWe have had to rebuild and find new players but they need time to adapt. We changed the manager in mid-season too, with a new philosophy. It isn‚Äôt as easy as it looks.‚Äù A big-money move to City has not played out entirely as planned for Grealish, as he has just five goals and three assists this season.

'It's in Man City's hands' - Henderson admits Liverpool are playing catch-up in Premier League title race,"Jordan Henderson has admitted the Premier League title is in Manchester City's hands and Liverpool are playing catch-up after failing to beat the champions at Etihad Stadium. City and Liverpool played out a thrilling 2-2 draw on Sunday that ensured Pep Guardiola's side remain one point clear of the Reds at the top of the table with seven matches remaining. Jurgen Klopp's men twice came from behind to earn a point in Manchester, but Henderson admitted having ""mixed emotions"" after the final whistle. The Liverpool captain has warned his team-mates they must now be alert to capitalise on any mistakes from Man City in the final weeks of the campaign. ""We wanted to come here and win and then it would have been in our hands in the next seven games,"" Henderson told LFC TV.  ""Unfortunately it's not and it's in City's hands. We have to keep going right to the end and if there's any slip-up we need to be there ready to pounce. That's the mentality. ""Mixed emotions as we wanted three points but we dug deep and didn't lose the game, which is important as well. We have to take the positives and move on and get ready for the next game. ""It's going to be an intense game at this level and magnitude, and it was, especially early on. We could have started a bit better but to be fair I thought we kept going and went behind twice and came back twice, that's really positive and shows great character to keep going in tough moments.  ""At the same time we can be a bit better, especially with the ball. I felt when we played football it hurt them, and that's where the goals came from."" Liverpool's next Premier League outing will see them welcome arch-rivals Manchester United to Anfield on April 19, five days before a Merseyside derby clash with Everton at Goodison Park. The Reds' final game of the month will see them take on Newcastle at St James Park and they are due to open their May schedule with a home encounter against Tottenham.

Rangnick: I don't know what Fletcher's role is at Man Utd,"Ralf Rangick has admitted that he doesn't know exactly what role Darren Fletcher has at Old Trafford, but has revealed that he has a big input in what goes on in training. Former United midfielder Fletcher was brought back to the club by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January last year, initially taking up a coaching role with the first-team squad. He was appointed the club's first-ever technical director two months later, and is now working closely with Ralf Rangnick, who replaced Solskjaer as head coach on an interim basis following his sacking in November. Rangnick has found Fletcher's opinion on tactics and intimate knowledge of the United squad valuable during his first three months in charge, but concedes he is still in the dark with regards to the specific nature of his technical director post. ""Well, I can only talk about what I've experienced in the last 11 to 12 weeks. He has always been part of almost every training session and each game,"" the German manager told reporters when quizzed on Fletcher. ""Whenever I have had a question about what he thinks, because he obviously knows the players, he has known them for a long time. I could always, and will always, ask him for his opinion. So it is good to have him in the team. ""What is his role in with regard to the club? I don't really know, to be honest. I can only tell you what is happening in the training sessions, around the training sessions and around the games. In those areas, it is good to have him on board."" Fletcher spent the majority of his 16-year playing career on United's books, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League while making 342 appearances for the club. The 38-year-old set about getting his coaching badges after retiring following a spell at Stoke City in 2019, and since returning to Old Trafford last year he has enjoyed great influence behind the scenes. His role as technical director is officially a boardroom title and linked with recruitment, though, which has led to some confusion given his regular presence in training sessions and at matches. Fletcher temporarily returned to the coaching set-up during Michael Carrick's caretaker stint at the helm before Rangnick's appointment, and was seen in the dugout again for United's 1-1 draw with Southampton on Feburary 12 and their 2-0 win against Brighton last Tuesday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rangnick-i-dont-know-fletcher-role-man-utd/bltcd25199864def617,James Westwood,1c08e795-3817-4657-a592-48bf0df42f3c

One more year? Why Klopp would love 'role model' Milner to stay at Liverpool,"If Fenway Sports Group were paying attention to Liverpool‚Äôs win over Newcastle, then James Milner can surely expect a phone call. Age ain‚Äôt nothing but a number, and the 36-year-old proved as much at St James‚Äô Park on Saturday, delivering a timeless performance as Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side kept up the pressure on Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. ‚ÄúOutstanding,‚Äù was Klopp‚Äôs verdict. There‚Äôs a reason he wants his vice-captain to stick around for at least another season, and this was it. In the Tyneside heat, Milner did what he always does. He led by example, he got his head down and he produced the goods. It was his tackle, firm but fair on Fabian Schar, which led to the winning goal, scored in superb fashion by Naby Keita. It was his pass, clipped perfectly over the top of the Newcastle defence, which should have led to another for Diogo Jota in the second half.  And when Jonjo Shelvey lined up a dangerous-looking free-kick, 25 yards out, it was his head which deflected the ball to safety. He spent a few seconds on the floor after that, but was soon back on his feet, chasing and challenging, recycling possession and making sure his team-mates didn‚Äôt dare switch off.  Liverpool aren‚Äôt short of leaders, by any means, but Milner‚Äôs standards are the highest of them all. Impress him, and you‚Äôre doing something right. Fall short, and you‚Äôll know about it. It is coming up to 20 years since he made his debut as a professional, and his appetite for the game is as strong now as it was when emerging as a teenager with boyhood club Leeds United.  That‚Äôs why he - and Liverpool - have a decision to make this summer. Do they stick or twist? One more year or a thanks-for-the-memories? Milner‚Äôs contract expires in June, and while there have been initial talks between the club and his representative, Matthew Buck, it is fair to say that there are doubts on both sides at present.  FSG appreciate the superb service he has given the club since joining on a free transfer from Manchester City in 2015. He has made close to 300 appearances, in a range of different positions, and never has he let anybody down. His fingerprints are all over some of Liverpool‚Äôs greatest nights, and all of Klopp‚Äôs biggest triumphs. ‚ÄúNothing we achieved over the last few years would have happened without him,‚Äù the manager himself suggested at St James‚Äô Park. But time waits for nobody. Milner may be as fit as ever - no player, on either side, recorded a higher average speed during Saturday‚Äôs game - but he will be 37 in January and knows he is, at best, Klopp‚Äôs fifth-choice midfield option. With the likes of Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott and the soon-to-arrive Fabio Carvalho all developing rapidly, opportunities could be even further limited next season. Saturday was his 35th appearance of the season - he made 36 last term and 37 in 2019-20 - but only his eighth Premier League start, and his first since January 2. He may understand when he‚Äôs left out - and Liverpool‚Äôs form hardly helps him argue otherwise - but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs happy with it, or that he‚Äôs willing to accept it. It is that, rather than salary or length of contract, which will play the biggest part in his decision. Klopp, certainly, would like him to stay and has made that point both to Milner and to Julian Ward, the incoming sporting director. Ward and Milner go way back, having worked together at Manchester City, and the smart money is on an agreement being reached over a one-year extension.  It is interesting to compare and contrast Milner‚Äôs situation with that of Fernandinho, another veteran midfielder who is out of contract in the summer. The Manchester City captain appeared to catch his manager, Pep Guardiola, by surprise when announcing in a recent Champions League press conference his intention to return to Brazil. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know,‚Äù Guardiola responded, adding that ‚ÄúI understand players want to play‚Ä¶I would love to be with him [longer].‚Äù Like Milner at Liverpool, Fernandinho is a key figure at City, a standard-bearer in training and a vocal presence in the dressing room. Like Milner, he has deputised in various positions, stepping in and stepping up, and like Milner, he will be hard to replace, if and when he eventually leaves.  Liverpool have found in recent years with the likes of Dejan Lovren, Gini Wijnaldum and, in particular, Adam Lallana, that often it is the person, the character, who is missed as much as the player. Milner most definitely falls into that category. Not many players, after all, have a door named after them at the training ground.  ‚ÄúHe sets the standard, in a way not many people can set standards,‚Äù said Klopp on Saturday. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a role model, and incredibly important for us.‚Äù Newcastle served only to underline that fact.

Nunez's stupid sending-off leaves Liverpool's title hopes hanging in the balance,"It‚Äôs fair to say that‚Äôs not how Darwin Nunez saw his big night going, and it certainly wasn‚Äôt how Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool envisaged it either. The Uruguayan‚Äôs home debut, his first Premier League start, lasted just 57 minutes, and ended in the ignominy of a straight red card in front of the Kop.¬† When we talked about Nunez making a big impact on Merseyside, we didn‚Äôt imagine that impact would be made on the chin of Joachim Andersen, the Crystal Palace defender who was left flattened by the Reds striker‚Äôs obvious, and staggeringly daft, headbutt. Nunez‚Äôs indiscipline cost Liverpool on the night, as they laboured to a 1-1 draw which means that, for the first time in a decade, they have failed to win either of their opening two games in a Premier League campaign.¬† It could have been worse too: a goal down at the time of the dismissal, were it not for Luis Diaz‚Äôs brilliance, or Wilfried Zaha‚Äôs late miss, they‚Äôd have been nursing their first home league defeat in 17 months. Klopp stated afterwards that he was ‚Äúproud‚Äù of his team‚Äôs response with 10 men, and said he would speak to his new ¬£64 million ($76m) signing about his moment of madness. Whatever provocation there was from Andersen ‚Äì and it was relatively minor, given the compilation videos circulating on social media ‚Äì there can be no excuse for such a reaction, especially with VAR in operation and the referee, Paul Tierney, looking straight at the incident in any case. Nunez‚Äôs indiscretion will cost him, and it will cost Liverpool. He will now miss three games through suspension, starting with next Monday‚Äôs trip to Manchester United, and at a time when Klopp‚Äôs resources are already stretched worryingly thin, this was a headache he could ill afford. A moment of madness from Darwin N√∫√±ez and he's shown a straight red card! ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/YAErzuuUKq ‚ÄúBecause we have no other striker,‚Äù was Klopp‚Äôs response when asked why he had chosen Nunez to start against Palace. He was smiling as he delivered the line, but he was telling the truth. With Diogo Jota sidelined and Roberto Firmino also ruled out, Nunez had to play. Even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has been used occasionally as a (rather awkward-looking) centre-forward in the past, is injured. Two games into the season, Liverpool‚Äôs squad is creaking. They currently have 10 first-team players out, and two more ‚Äì Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson ‚Äì were deemed fit enough only for a place on the bench against Palace after minor issues. Firmino and Joel Matip were the latest to fall, Matip reporting a groin injury ahead of training on Friday, which Klopp says will keep him out for around two weeks, and Firmino picking up an as-yet-unknown issue over the weekend. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known a week like it,‚Äù Klopp said in his post-match press conference on Monday. ‚ÄúIt was like we had a witch in the building, honestly! Every day, somebody else pulled out [of training] for the craziest reasons.‚Äù Nunez‚Äôs silliness, then, was the last thing he needed, although for once he will be grateful for the fixture list, which gives his team a full week to prepare for the United game.¬† He hopes Firmino, at least, will have a chance of returning for that, but Matip is out, Jota is still a couple of weeks away, and Oxlade-Chamberlain, Thiago Alcantara, Ibrahima Konate and Curtis Jones are still on the treatment table. Even the No.2 goalkeeper, Caoimhin Kelleher, summer signing Calvin Ramsay and teenage star Kaide Gordon are crocked. The first red card for violent conduct of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool reign üò° pic.twitter.com/DkVmOCSygA It all adds up to a challenge, and one which will intensify calls for Liverpool to look to solve their problems in the transfer market. News that Wolves have agreed a deal to sign Matheus Nunes, the Sporting Lisbon midfielder who has been linked with the Reds recently, will have gone down like a lead balloon with supporters in that regard. Klopp insists Liverpool won‚Äôt panic buy, and we should take him at his word, but this has been a troubling start to the campaign, one which already leaves them playing catch up with Manchester City, and which places added pressure on that trip to Old Trafford next week. Lose there, against the league‚Äôs crisis club, and the knives will be out for sure. That‚Äôs the price of success, sadly, and the standards set by Liverpool in recent years are such that any drop ‚Äì such as a couple of below-par results ‚Äì is going to create chatter. Their job now is to quieten that chatter, and that can only be done through wins and through convincing performances. For now, they‚Äôre going to have to achieve those without Nunez.  The new boy will learn from his mistake, for sure, and will almost certainly go on to become a big player for Liverpool in the coming months and years, but his stupidity has left his team, and his manager, facing a tricky few weeks.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nunez-stupid-sending-off-liverpool-title-hopes/bltdf7600a20da8a912,Neil Jones,c1d30aed-8886-466a-82e1-8262d28a5a21
Spurs close to sealing ¬£50m Richarlison transfer with Everton forward set to undergo medical,"Tottenham are closing in on the signing of Richarlison from Everton, GOAL can confirm, with the Brazil international forward set to undergo a medical. It appeared at one stage as though the 25-year-old would be heading to north London as a new addition at Arsenal, but the Gunners have turned their attention to alternative Samba stars such as Gabriel Jesus and Raphinha. That has left a door open for Spurs to swoop in, with another proven Premier League performer being added to Antonio Conte‚Äôs ranks on the back of deals for Fraser Forster and Yves Bissouma. It is understood that Spurs will be splashing out an initial ¬£50 million ($61m) fee in order to get a deal for Richarlison over the line. An agreement reached with Premier League rivals includes the option for a further ¬£10m ($12m) to be paid in add-ons. Reports suggest that the South American star will be committing to a five-year contract with Spurs through to the summer of 2027.

Sweden international Dejan Kulusevski impressed on the back of his loan move from Juventus in January, but questions have been asked of how long Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn will be sticking around. Conte is eager to avoid leaving himself short of options in an important area of the field, with Richarlison being drafted in as another ready-made starter. He has, having first arrived in English football at Watford in 2017, reached double figures when it comes to goals in each of the last four seasons.

The Scandinavian nation was rocked by the attack in the early hours of Saturday morning outside a popular gay nightclub in Oslo.  Two other venues were also targeted, with at least two people killed and 21 injured. Hegerberg, who plays her club football for Lyon in France, played for Norway on Saturday just hours after the shooting.

'The pinnacle of individual achievements' - Ronaldo reacts to winning FIFA Special Best award,"Cristiano Ronaldo says it was a ""tremendous honour"" to win the FIFA Special Best Award on Monday. The Portugal star was handed the trophy in recognition of him becoming the highest-scoring men's player in international football history. Ronaldo broke the record set by former Iran hero Ali Daei in September when he scored his 110th goal for his country. He has since taken his tally up to 115. FIFA unveiled the special accolade for the 36-year-old during The Best Awards ceremony in Zurich and the attacker expressed his delight on social media.    ""Winning The FIFA Special Best Award is a tremendous honor and a huge privilege,"" he wrote in an Instagram post.  ""The fact that such a relevant institution chose to recognize me as the Top Goalscorer in the history of FIFA competitions is, for me, the pinnacle of my individual achievements in representation of my beloved country. ""Now, it‚Äôs up to me to turn this award into extra fuel and motivation to help achieving all our goals at Man. United for this season, as well as to the upcoming play-off matches in March, so that Portugal can be at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and we can all keep writing this amazing story together. ""Last but not least, a special word to all the tremendous players that represented Portugal by my side over the last two decades, and to all the international players that I faced so many times all around the globe. Your talent, your professionalism and your quality always contributed to make me a better player."" The five-time Ballon d'Or winner will turn 37 in less than three weeks, on February 5. Despite his age, Ronaldo feels he can keep playing into his forties, as he said at the ceremony in Zurich: ‚ÄúI still have the passion for the game. Not just to score goals. It‚Äôs to entertain myself because I‚Äôve played football since I was five, six years old. When I go out on the pitch, even in training, I‚Äôm still enjoying it and my motivation is still there. Even though I‚Äôm going to be 37 soon, I feel good, I feel motivated, I have been working hard since I was 18 years old and I continue to.  ‚ÄúI love the game. I still have that passion. I want to continue. People ask me sometimes how many more years I‚Äôm going to play and I say I hope to play another four, five years.

"Bundesliga odds: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund & the top teams‚Äô chances of winning in 2021-22","Having won the Bundesliga title in each of the last nine seasons, Bayern Munich are already well on course to complete their historic 10 in a row in 2022. New coach Julian Nagelsmann has picked up where predecessor Hansi Flick left off, leading his team to the Herbstmeister position of sitting top of the league at the winter break. Boasting a nine-point lead at the top of the table, Bayern are once again threatening to run away with a league they have completely dominated over the past decade. GOAL brings you everything you need to know about the favourites and outsiders for the Bundesliga title in 2021-22. Having picked up 14 wins from their opening 17 fixtures to pull comfortably clear of the chasing pack, Bayern Munich are now overwhelming 1/50 (1.02) favourites with bet365 to go all the way to the title once again. The record 31-times champions are still spearheaded by the evergreen Robert Lewandowski, whose 19 goals from 17 league matches so far puts him well on course to win a fifth consecutive Golden Boot. With Dayot Upamecano and Marcel Sabitzer having followed manager Nagelsmann from last season‚Äôs runners-up RB Leipzig to the Allianz Arena in the summer, the gap appears to be widening between Bayern and the rest of the league. Indeed, RB Leipzig have fallen dramatically away into mid-table since losing their coach and key players, leaving them as huge 250/1 (251.0) outsiders to lift the league trophy for the first time. Instead, it is traditional rivals Borussia Dortmund who offer the best hope of preventing the title returning to Munich this campaign, priced at 18/1 (19.0) to be crowned champions for the first time since 2012. Dortmund certainly possess players capable of reaching the very top, none more so than Erling Haaland and his record of 53 goals in 54 Bundesliga matches. The Norway international has started just 10 league games this season (scoring 13 goals) due to injuries, so keeping him fit could prove central to an unlikely title bid in the second half of the campaign. Marco Rose‚Äôs men did push Bayern all the way in a 3-2 defeat at the Westfalenstadion at the beginning of December and remain their only potential challengers to what looks like a one-horse race. While the title race has been a closed shop over the past 10 years, Germany‚Äôs battle for the top four is once again providing plenty of intrigue. Dortmund have remained almost ever-presents in the Champions League - finishing in the top four in 10 of the last 11 seasons - and are priced at just 1/150 (1.01) to maintain that record this time out. However, RB Leipzig are now at Evens (2.0) to secure their place for a fourth year in a row as they sit six points adrift in 10th at halfway.  Bayer Leverkusen‚Äôs days as Champions League regulars are a distant memory after just one top-four finish in the last five seasons but they are now 8/11 (1.73) to return to Europe‚Äôs top table as they occupy fourth place. Neck-and-neck with Leverkusen on 28 points, Hoffenheim are 9/4 (3.25) to achieve a Champions League spot for just the third time in their relatively short top-flight history. Freiburg have never reached the Champions League and are dark horses at 5/2 (3.50) despite sitting in third as we enter 2022, with Christian Streich‚Äôs team having achieved some eye-catching results so far. Both just a point adrift of fourth-placed Leverkusen, Union Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt can be backed at 4/1 (5.0) and 8/1 (9.0) to really upset the established order by claiming a place at Europe‚Äôs top table. Mainz are on offer at 9/1 (10.0) as they begin the new year just four points shy of fourth place in ninth position, while Koln are a longer 16/1 (17.0) despite sitting a point ahead in eighth place. Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+.

Who is Tyrell Malacia? Everything you need to know about Manchester United's ¬£13m transfer target,"Erik ten Hag's Dutch revolution is underway at Manchester United as the former Ajax manager closes in on the signing of Tyrell Malacia, a player he will have seen plenty of times in Eredivisie. Malacia, who shares an agent with fellow United target Frenkie de Jong, is on the verge of moving to Old Trafford for around ¬£13 million ($16m), plus add-ons, making him the club's first signing of the summer. Indeed, the Red Devils appear to have successfully hijacked Lyon's move for Malacia, with West Ham also among those interested. The 22-year-old Dutch defender is a marauding left-back, having been deployed in that position for both Feyenoord and the Netherlands national team. Catch him if you can üí®Tyrell Malacia scores his first senior goal for Feyenoord! üëè pic.twitter.com/TFJH4rkON1 Born in Rotterdam, Malacia joined Feyenoord's youth academy in 2008 at the age of nine. He signed his first professional contract in 2015 and made his debut two years later in a Champions League win over Napoli. Malacia played the full 90 minutes against the Serie A side in Rotterdam that night and was then handed his Eredivisie debut seven days later against Heerenveen. In total, Malacia has made 136 appearances for Feyenoord, scoring four goals. The left-back won the KNVB Cup with the Dutch club in 2017-18 and the Johan Cruyff Shield in 2018. He was a member of the Feyenoord team that made it to the final of the UEFA Conference League in 2021-22, losing to Jose Mourinho's Roma in the final. Malacia played 88 minutes of that match and was named in UEFA's Team of the Tournament for his performances across the competition. Malacia has represented the Netherlands from youth level to the senior national team. Born in Rotterdam to a Curacaoan father and Surinamese mother, Malacia has represented the country of his birth since earning his first U-16 call-up in 2014. He went on to play for the U-17s, 18s, 19s, 20s and 21s before finally earning his senior debut in 2021 against Montenegro. In total, he has five senior caps and will be aiming to be part of Louis van Gaal's squad for the World Cup. The deal to bring Malacia to United came out of the blue, with the Netherlands international having been set to join Lyon until Ten Hag's side came in and agreed a deal with Feyenoord. West Ham are also said to have been interested, but Malacia is set to choose to be a part of the rebuilding process in Manchester. At 22 years old, Malacia has plenty of time to develop at United and will challenge Luke Shaw and Alex Telles for the left-back role. It doesn't bode well for Brandon Williams' future at the club, however, with the defender having returned from a loan spell at Norwich City but now seemingly fourth choice in the pecking order.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tyrell-malacia-manchester-united-transfer-target/blt6c932ca02acf3f92,Ryan Tolmich,afe9539d-e2b3-4d67-9049-3e593349b2ab

Ronaldo to miss Man Utd's meeting with Liverpool following death of baby son,"Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Manchester United's Premier League meeting with Liverpool on Tuesday night following the death of his baby son. Ronaldo made the heartbreaking announcement via his Instagram account on Monday, during which he also revealed the birth of a baby girl with his long-term partner, Georgina Rodriguez. The couple had been expecting twins, but asked for privacy after the loss and United have now confirmed Ronaldo will be taking a period of compassionate leave. Ronaldo, who has scored 21 goals for the Red Devils since returning to the club from Juventus last summer, won't be in Ralf Rangnick's squad for their trip to Anfield. The club have released a statement on their website confirming the news, which reads: ""Family is more important than everything and Ronaldo is supporting his loved ones at this immensely difficult time. ""As such, we can confirm that he will not feature in the match against Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday evening and we underline the family's request for privacy. ""Cristiano, we are all thinking of you and sending strength to the family.""

Ronaldo's record-breaking night proves new Man Utd boss Rangnick can rely on him,"If Cristiano Ronaldo felt the need to send a message to his new manager ‚Äì after all the talk that he would not fit into his setup ‚Äì then scoring twice to secure Manchester United three points against Arsenal is one way to do it.¬† Ralf Rangnick was in the stands to watch his new team and while he will have seen plenty of problems that need rectifying, Ronaldo would not appear to be among them. Rangnick was on his feet applauding the Portuguese for his 800th and 801st career goals respectively.¬† Whether he presses enough or not, he still should be considered for the starting XI every week.¬† As he made his run into the box in the 52nd minute, the Arsenal players knew what was coming. A low Marcus Rashford cross came into the box and Ronaldo was there to finish it.¬† He has also now taken over penalty duties from Bruno Fernandes and dispatched what proved to be the winning goal from the spot after Martin Odegaard fouled Fred.¬† It is that inevitability, almost a guarantee of goals, that has led to managers tailoring their teams around the 36-year-old.¬† Ronaldo has an aura around him; just ask the fan who ran onto the pitch with 86 minutes on the clock in an attempt to get a selfie with him.¬† However, you don‚Äôt get the sense that Rangnick will bow down to him and, in a week when he made his feelings known about yet another Lionel Messi Ballon d‚ÄôOr, maybe that‚Äôs why Ronaldo seemed so determined to prove a point against Arsenal.¬† Two goals will certainly help his cause but his work off the ball is more likely to impress Rangnick. He hassled the Arsenal back line all evening, chasing loose balls and putting in a shift at both ends of the pitch.¬† With United holding on to a 3-2 lead, he cleared an Arsenal corner before sprinting the length of the pitch in an attempt to get on the end of a counterattack.¬† Rangnick, who sat making notes throughout the game, will no doubt have questions to answer about Ronaldo in the days and weeks to come. But whether he should start or not should not be one of them.¬† Since he rejoined the club, he has scored three winning goals in the Premier League and has single-handedly kept them in the Champions League with six goals in five group-stage games. Without his contribution, they would not be through to the last 16 with a game to play.¬† However, while Ronaldo‚Äôs name might have been struck off the to-do list, there are still a few issues to resolve. For starters, United are still conceding too many goals. Emile Smith-Rowe‚Äôs bizarre opener means they have conceded in 15 consecutive home games in all competitions ‚Äì their worst run since 1959.¬† There are issues with control and dominance in midfield and, at times, they were again slow and pedestrian.¬† Credit should go to Michael Carrick, the stand-in coach who tearfully stepped away from the club at full time.  He stepped up at a time when the team were in dire need of direction and led them to two big victories and a draw against one of the favourites to win the league this term in Chelsea.¬† Now, it‚Äôs over to Rangnick.¬† If Carrick can pass on any advice to him as he departs, it is the importance of Ronaldo.¬† ‚ÄúHe has been terrific this week, especially for me, the things I‚Äôve asked of him and the way he has gone about his business in and around the place, he's been absolutely top top drawer,‚Äù Carrick said. ‚ÄúNo surprise he goes and scores tonight, the perfect ending really.‚Äù¬† Rangnick won‚Äôt be sure of many things on his first day in the job but he knows one thing for certain: he‚Äôll be able to rely on Ronaldo.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-proves-man-utd-boss-rangnick-can-rely-on-him/blt70c882cc7206ec74,Charlotte Duncker,29549696-0bcd-4371-849e-77ef324804e4
"Attila Szalai transfer to Chelsea a 'done deal', claims Hungary coach Rossi amid ¬£20m move rumours","Speculation regarding a move to Chelsea for Fenerbahce defender Attila Szalai has been building over recent weeks, and Hungary boss Marco Rossi claims that a January deal has been agreed. The 23-year-old only moved to Turkey in the winter transfer window of 2021, but another switch could be on the cards 12 months on. However, Fenerbahce have subsequently released a statement denying Szalai is on the brink of a transfer away from the club. Rossi, who coaches the highly-rated centre-half at international level, is not surprised to see the Blues swooping in as Szalai would not look out of place in any of Europe‚Äôs top divisions. When asked to picked out players in the Hungarian ranks that could make an impact in Serie A, Italian coach Rossi told Calciomercato: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to name just one player, but right now I see very well Attila Szalai, who plays for Fenerbahce, but I think he is joining Chelsea. ‚ÄúClearly, he has been followed by important clubs in Spain, but apparently his move to Chelsea is a done deal. He would be a great player also for Italian football.‚Äù In response to those comments Fenerbahce issued a firm denial. ""The allegations regarding the transfer of our player Attila Szalai, which have been made public in the last few days, based on foreign press and social media, do not reflect the truth,"" read a statement. Rossi is right to suggest that Szalai has been attracting admiring glances from leading sides in La Liga. Sevilla and Atletico Madrid have been credited with interest, while even Barcelona were said to be monitoring a player of considerable promise at one stage. Chelsea would appear to have won the race for a much sought-after signature, with it reported that the Blues will be parting with around ¬£20 million ($26m) in order to get a deal over the line. Thomas Tuchel has been scouring the market for another centre-half at Stamford Bridge for a while. Sevilla star Jules Kounde was identified as a top target over the summer, but the France international proved to be out of reach. Efforts are now being stepped up to tick that particular box, with the current Champions League holders aware of the need to get bodies on board. With Antonio Rudiger running his contract down towards free agency in 2022, and with Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta also approaching the final six months of their respective deals, the Premier League heavyweights are wary of leaving themselves short in an important position.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/attila-szalai-chelsea-transfer-20-million/bltf9bad6b004dd972a,Chris Burton,cd109cf2-7e73-4dc8-ad61-f9e2afbdfd2c
Swedish FA boss: World Cup play-off against Russia almost unthinkable amid Ukraine invasion,"The chairman of the Swedish Football Association (SvFF) has admitted that a 2022 World Cup play-off clash with Russia is ‚Äúalmost unthinkable‚Äù at this stage, following the decision of Vladimir Putin to send troops into Ukraine. Political tension in Eastern Europe continues to intensify, with a military invasion now underway. Those actions may impact on sporting matters, with Russia due to take part in important fixtures that have places at a major finals in Qatar up for grabs. With the winner of a meeting between Russia and Poland on March 24 due to face the victors of a tie involving Sweden and the Czech Republic, two high-profile fixtures could take place on Russian soil. Karl-Erik Nilsson, chairman of the Swedish FA, has, however, admitted that his country would find it difficult to make such a trip. He has told Reuters: ‚ÄúIt's a possible scenario. Spontaneously around the feelings we have as we wake up this morning are that it is almost unthinkable that we in a few weeks would play a football match in Russia. ‚ÄúAs it looks here and now, today, there is absolutely no desire to play a football match in Russia.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúOur thoughts go to our friends in Ukraine over the situation they woke up to today, it's awful. Football should be seen as something of less importance in the middle of this inferno.‚Äù There have been suggestions that Russia should be taken out of the reckoning for World Cup qualification, but Nilsson says it is too early to be making decisions of such magnitude. The 64-year-old former referee said: ‚ÄúI believe that [in these situations] much is called for very quickly - we will need to live and socialise even in the future, and I think we shouldn't be too quick with solutions. ‚ÄúInstead, we should take our time and see what actions are needed. For the moment we are looking forward to arms being laid down and that peace and freedom come into existence.‚Äù He added when quizzed on whether the desires of those in Ukraine could shape football‚Äôs response to an escalating conflict: ‚ÄúIt's important that the requests come from Ukraine. ‚ÄúAt the moment they have a lot more to think about than football, but a future will arrive one day and we must show solidarity with our football friends around Europe.‚Äù Ukraine are also due to be in play-off action on March 24, when they face Scotland for the right to take on Wales or Austria in the Path A final. They also have UEFA Nations League outings to come in the summer, with the Republic of Ireland due to visit Lviv on June 14. The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) has said in a statement relating to that fixture: ‚ÄúThe FAI will continue to communicate on an ongoing basis with our Government, our colleagues at UEFA and the Ukraine Association of Football with regards to the latest developments and the implications for the Ukraine v Republic of Ireland fixture in the UEFA Nations League, currently fixed for Lviv on Tuesday, June 14th. ‚ÄúThe FAI will also welcome Ukraine to Dublin on June 4th for the opening fixture in the UEFA Nations League campaign. The FAI awaits the outcome of the UEFA ExCo meeting on Friday, February 25th which has been called to discuss the current situation in the Ukraine.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/swedish-fa-world-cup-play-off-russia-unthinkable-ukraine/blt07f058dfb15b9cd5,Chris Burton,a67aee88-5318-4b55-af14-526ebd1c2749
"Man Utd target Arnautovic has received offer from a 'well-known club', ex-West Ham striker's agent confirms","Marko Arnautovic has been the subject of a transfer bid from a ""well-known"" club, his agent has said, with GOAL having confirmed that Manchester United are interested in the Bologna striker. Arnautovic has emerged on the Red Devils' radar as they look to strengthen in attack before the end of the summer transfer window. It has been reported they have already had an offer of around ‚Ç¨9 million (¬£8m/$9m) turned down by the Serie A side. The 33-year-old's agent and brother, Danijel Arnautovic, has confirmed that an approach has been made and revealed that the player is open to the move. ""It's true that there is an offer from a well-known club,"" he told Kurier.  ""I'm in contact with Bologna to see if that can be realised."" United are still in the process of rebuilding the team under new coach Erik ten Hag. They have invested in defence and midfield so far this summer, signing Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Christian Eriksen. However, they are yet to freshen up the attack and are at risk of being deprived of options over the season. Anthony Martial is already out injured, while star forward Cristiano Ronaldo could still leave the club, having reportedly declared his desire to make a move this summer. Arnautovic spent six years in England playing for Stoke and West Ham before leaving for China in 2019 and has been highlighted as an option for the Old Trafford side. However, coach Ten Hag refused to comment on a possible move for him after his side's 2-1 loss to Brighton on Sunday. He said: ""I don't go into names because I think in this pre-season 250 players are involved or linked with Manchester United, so that's it. We have two strikers, maybe a third one, with Marcus Rashford as well.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-target-arnautovic-offer-well-known-club-ex-west-ham/blt9cf7c8fa45fccce6,Peter McVitie,c198e7f2-a811-4a1e-8de6-0dd060ef929c
Can Mendy eclipse Salah and Mane as Chelsea meet Liverpool in FA Cup final?,"You are only as good as your last performance, and Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy knows this more than most after the criticism he has received in recent weeks. The Blues' number one and Africa Cup of Nations winner‚Äôs game has been beset with high-profile errors that have cost the West Londoners of late, thus seeing supporters lose the faith and assuredness they had with the shot-stopper between the sticks. Mendy‚Äôs dip since the last international break has been so bad that a rising section of the club‚Äôs followers will not question any decision to utilise Kepa Arrizabalaga in Saturday‚Äôs FA Cup final against Liverpool. The Senegal goalkeeper‚Äôs drop off has coincided with the Blues‚Äô worst run of results in 2021-22 in which they have fallen to four defeats in all competitions since the start of April, one more than they had managed with the 30-year-old in goal hitherto. Even though glaring errors have been limited to games against Brentford and Real Madrid, a deterioration in the Senegal international‚Äôs shot-stopping has precipitated the ongoing criticism and a few calls for a Kepa recall on Saturday. It seems a long time ago that Mendy delivered a world-class showing at the Brentford Community Stadium, making a staggering six saves in the final half-hour to preserve the London outfit‚Äôs 1-0 lead or a top class Stamford Bridge performance in the Blues‚Äô 3-0 success over Aston Villa. Against this weekend‚Äôs opponents, the goalkeeper has flourished too.  It was Mendy who preserved a precious point at Anfield when 10-man Chelsea played the entire second half with a player short and, more recently, delivered a stunning showing in the League Cup final in late February. That final ended 0-0 after 120 minutes, but it was anything but a damp squib, with both sides fashioning quality chances throughout the game. Two of Mendy‚Äôs six saves in that decider came in quick succession, saving a Naby Keita effort from just outside the area before throwing himself forward to deny Sadio Mane dispatching the rebound from six yards. It was at that end Petr Cech made an equally stunning save 10 years ago to thwart a bullet Andy Carroll header in the FA Cup final to protect Chelsea‚Äôs 2-1 lead, a game decided by the irrepressible Didier Drogba. Indeed, the sensible call would be trusting Mendy to reprise that Wembley performance from February as the West Londoners strive to reverse the trend of failed finals at the Home of Football. The Blues have suffered defeats in two successive finals ‚Äî respectively beaten by Arsenal and Leicester City in 2019/20 and 2020/21 ‚Äî and want to prevent a third straight loss in the sport‚Äôs oldest cup competition. Another victory at Wembley will take Chelsea‚Äôs haul of FA Cup wins to eight, one more than Liverpool whom they are currently tied on seven titles.  They moved level with the Reds in 2012 and could surpass the Merseyside giants who have not claimed this trophy since a Steven Gerrard-inspired performance in that rip-roaring 2006 final against West Ham United. Nullifying the threat of in-form Mane would largely be half the job done, while Mohamed Salah possesses the match-winning quality despite an extended lull that reads three goals in his last 19 games for club and country. 17 of those games have been for Liverpool though, and it is worrying that the Egyptian has failed to even hit a shot on target in 11 of those games. Mane, by contrast, has caught fire in the second half of the campaign, particularly in a central role which he has mostly occupied since the turn of the year. The Senegal superstar has found the back of the net seven times in 13 Premier League appearances since returning from Afcon duty in February, one fewer than the eight he managed in 20 games preceding the Nations Cup. It was the forward who, by and large, decided last month‚Äôs semi-final success over Manchester City, too, notching a brace against Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men in a 3-2 success, and will be Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs key man in this year‚Äôs final as the Reds chase a first title in 16 years. The stage is set for the repeat of the 2012 final, and there is a feeling the aforementioned African stars will either make or mar their side‚Äôs chances at the Home of Football.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/can-mendy-eclipse-salah-and-mane-as-chelsea-meet-liverpool-in-fa-/blt5ed68380d9e95b87,Seye Omidiora,f78c7757-d504-4563-a431-feb05d4febb6
'I went to the games and then straight to the tattoo shop!' - Football fans and their ink,"2022 marks the year of the UEFA Women's Euro and the FIFA Men‚Äôs World Cup. All this week, VICE and GOAL will be collaborating to publish insightful, interesting stories from the world of football and fan culture, introducing VICE fans to GOAL and GOAL fans to VICE. Footballers and tattoos walk hand in hand nowadays, with it rare for a top-flight game to go by without at least a handful of players sporting some ink on their body. For most players, their tattoos are a small reflection of their personalities, offering an insight into more than just their public image. Meanwhile, in the stands, increasing numbers of supporters are also keen to show off their tattoos, particularly those with a footballing theme. Supporting their club is an aspect of their personalities that these fans are keen to display, so we spoke to four such die-hards to understand the inspiration behind their tatts: VICE x GOAL: What‚Äôs your name? Harry Brinkley. How old are you? Twenty-three. And how many football tattoos do you have? Four in total, but it forms one big sleeve. How long have you had that for? It started in 2019 and it finished roughly late last year. So, all in all, two-and-a-half to three years. Why did you get it? Growing up, I was always massively into football. I always loved Barcelona. When I was a kid, Messi was my favourite player, so it sort of went together. Where did you get it done? I got it done by Sammy Kent. She used to work at a different tattoo shop, but she‚Äôs opening her own shop soon. She did all of it. Do you have any funny stories about tattoos? Erm, more so now I‚Äôve got it finished. All the time in London on tubes and stuff, I‚Äôll be on an escalator and I feel the person behind taking pictures of me, or stuff like that. That must be annoying? I‚Äôve been stopped so many times, in places like the Nike shop in London. How do you feel about that? It's a bit awkward, especially when they don‚Äôt ask. The guy on the escalator, I literally turned around and saw this flash going off. I was like, ‚ÄòWhat are you doing?‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòI really like your tattoo‚Äô, which is cool, but he could have asked first! Do you have any plans on getting anymore of an extension on it? I think I will be getting the top done at some point, but that‚Äôll be Chelsea-themed, because I support both. Do you have a design ready for that? I‚Äôve got a few pictures in mind that I want to get on it. But it‚Äôs just a case when I‚Äôm sort of free and have the money to get it done. I can imagine it‚Äôll be quite expensive. How much has it cost so far? I lost count halfway through! It‚Äôs definitely over ¬£2,000 ($2,600), easily. I‚Äôm not sure of the grand total. Have you seen Barcelona play? I‚Äôve been a few times. I‚Äôm actually going in May this year. With lockdown and stuff, it‚Äôs been hard recently. What‚Äôs your name? Manuel. And how old are you? I‚Äôm 55. So, how many football tattoos do you currently have? One here (points to his arm), the back of the head and one on this leg. And I‚Äôve got the badge, but it‚Äôs all bandaged up on the leg due to an abscess. That's the reason why I can‚Äôt get to any of the matches. But I‚Äôll be going next season when it starts, in October-ish time. You‚Äôve got a season pass already? Yeah, I've got all of that. Two grand‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll go to all the home games and that. Where do you sit in the stadium? I sit near the flag, where they take the corner. That‚Äôs my area. No one can take that area. I want to see them taking the corners. When did you get your first tattoo and which one was it? This one (points at the back of his head) was eight years ago. What was the reason for it? It‚Äôs not to show people I‚Äôve got a tattoo on the back of my head, it‚Äôs just like... Arsenal has always been my team. And this is the only way. I told the tattoo artist to put it there, so now everyone knows. I‚Äôve got the jacket too in the wardrobe. I‚Äôve got three jumpers of theirs. The jackets cost me ¬£150 ($200) each. Bloody hell, that‚Äôs quite expensive! Yeah. Do you go to the same place to get your tattoos done? Yeah, I go to the same place. I go to London to get it done, up the Angel. It's a man I know there who does it cheap. Did he do your other non-football tattoos too? Yeah, he does. Does he do other people's football tattoos? Nah, he just did this one as a favour for me. He can‚Äôt touch anyone else‚Äôs, but he did that for me because I know the guy. Do you have any plans for anymore tattoos? No, because I think the prices have gone up. I guess you don‚Äôt really need anymore? My sister has loads of tattoos. Is it a family thing? Yeah, my dad, sister and the rest. What‚Äôs your full name? Trisha Bergonzi How old are you? I turned 73 on St. Patrick's Day. What a great day to have a birthday! It‚Äôs the best. Your football team is...? Liverpool. How long have you been a supporter of Liverpool? Since I was 12. And is there a reason as to why you became a supporter of Liverpool? Erm, it‚Äôs maybe because one of my cousins was a red hot Liverpool fan and I copied them, which wasn‚Äôt very nice for my father as he was an Evertonian! There were seven in my house, they were all Evertonians and I was the only one that wasn‚Äôt. Every Saturday morning, the buses used to go past mine, we had a pub in Scotland Road. The buses used to go past, they‚Äôd stop at the bus stop and they‚Äôd all be getting on, all the tough guys except me. I‚Äôd be hanging out of the window crying my eyes out. My dad locked me in and then he used to let me out at half-time. But I thought bugger him, I‚Äôm going to go anyway! So, I sneaked out and ran all the way to Anfield, which is quite the journey up a hill. Were you living quite far from the ground? Not too far. In a car it would take about eight mins or so. At full-time, I‚Äôd come back down to the pub and my father was sitting in the parlour with customers and friends. I stood with my hands behind my back, looking down. And I‚Äôd say to him, ‚ÄòGuess where I‚Äôve been dad.' ‚ÄòWhere you been, girl?‚Äô ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been to Anfield‚Ä¶‚Äô It was murders, he had me by my hair and swung me all around! Bloody hell! It was serious business. Where I lived as well ‚Äì the famous road, Scotland Road ‚Äì that used to be the main road that all the lorry drivers used to go from the continent, from the Liverpool Docks to Scotland. Is the pub still in the family, or...? They knocked it down. Like most pubs? Yeah, they built the motorway. I think there were 156 pubs on Scotland Road. There‚Äôs two now. That‚Äôs sad. Yeah, I was born there and the flat we lived in is now listed. I used to play football there and they had these big black railings out in the street and they‚Äôre still there. It was the place we all played footy and that, you know, and they‚Äôre still there ‚Äòtil this day. That‚Äôs great, it's nice to know there‚Äôs something still there that you can remember. Lots of history in Liverpool. How many football tattoos do you have? Just the one. What was the reason for getting that? To pay homage to Liverpool Football Club. Where did you get it done? I got it done in Clerkenwell ‚Äì Family Business Tattoo. The manager‚Äôs name is David ‚Äì we call him Elvis because he‚Äôs got a big curled quiff! When did you get it done? Probably 10 years ago now. I wouldn‚Äôt go to anyone else and wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone else either. How did you find out about the parlour? He was a customer of mine. Do you have other tattoos? No, just the Liverpool one. That‚Äôs amazing, I love that. Originally, I wanted to get the two birds, one on each arm. Do you have funny anecdotes or stories about your time supporting Liverpool? The best time was when we won the Champions League in Istanbul. I went out there‚Ä¶ It was absolutely brilliant, the stories ‚Äì you‚Äôd be here all day! I can imagine‚Ä¶ I had all the players in front me on the plane in first class. It was just amazing. Such a great time. What‚Äôs your name? Nathan Jarvis. And how old are you? Forty-nine. How many tattoos do you have in total? In total, about 18 tattoos. And how many are football related? Six Chelsea ones. Nice, and can you talk me through them? The Chelsea emblem on the side of my leg, I had that done when Chelsea won the double in 2010. I got the European Cup one because I went to Munich to watch the final we won in 2012. And the following year we went to Amsterdam, Chelsea won the UEFA Cup in 2013. Did you get them done in Amsterdam and Munich? I went to the games, literally came home and pretty much went straight to the tattoo shop. Do you go to the same place every time? These three are all from the same place in Sunbury by Jason Davies. He's done all of them. What was the reason you got the first one? What spurred you on to get your first football tattoo? I‚Äôve been going Chelsea since I was eight years old. My brother used to take me. As I got older, then I started getting tattoos.  I decided to get a small Chelsea emblem and then the other ones followed really. Going travelling around watching Chelsea and then going to European games and deciding to get the trophies tattooed on me. Do you plan on getting anymore? Probably not, no. Now that I'm approaching 50 I probably won‚Äôt have anymore tattoos. Well, football tattoos anyways. Do you have any stories or anecdotes to go with the tattoos? The trophy ones on my leg are about travelling away to Europe, and I don‚Äôt really remember too much about either of the trips! There is a bit of a story from when we were in Munich. Me and the group of friends spent time just outside of the town in a bar, because in the middle of the town it got really busy, so we stayed most of the day. It got to about 4 or 5pm, and we decided to head over to the game. Went to the train station and it was shut. So, we literally had a bit of panic, there were no taxis available as you can imagine everyone at that sort of time was going to the game. There was an open top bus going down the road. I decided to jump in the road and stop it. It was a Corona beer promotion bus full of Munich supporters, and after a bit of conversation with them, they let me and my four friends onto the bus and they drove around Munich. We had Chelsea flags on top of the bus and they dropped us at a station, and we just got on the train and got to the game! That‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs kind of the opposite of how you‚Äôd want it to play out, jumping on a bus full of Munich supporters. Yeah, we literally got to the point where we knew we couldn‚Äôt get to the game. Obviously, we travelled to Munich the day before and were drinking and whatever. Got right to the last minute and we were sure we‚Äôd miss the game.

Chelsea complete ¬£20m signing of teenage wonderkid midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa,"Chelsea have completed the signing of Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa, the club announced on Thursday.  The London club had earlier confirmed that they had reached an agreement with Villa for the 18-year-old‚Äôs permanent transfer to Stamford Bridge. Thomas Tuchel is continuing to reinforce his squad ahead of the 2022-23 Premier League season, with Chukwuemeka the fourth arrival so far this summer after Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly, and Gabriel Slonina. It is reported that Chelsea have paid ¬£15 million (‚Ç¨17.93m/$18.27m) for his services to Aston Villa, with a further ¬£5 million in add-ons.  The midfielder has signed¬†a¬†six-year contract¬†that will keep him at Chelsea until 2028. The 18-year-old is regarded as one of the brightest talents and played an instrumental part in helping England to achieve glory at the Under-19 European Championship. He even got on the scoresheet in the final against Israel and earned a place in the UEFA Team of the Tournament.  He started his youth career at ¬†Northampton Town before switching to Villa at the age of 12. He made his ¬†Premier League against Tottenham in May 2021 and a week later secured the FA Youth Cup trophy after beating Liverpool 2-1. He finished the tournament as the top scorer and was named Academy Player of the Season. To date, he has had 14 Premier League appearances and also became the club's youngest player to have a goal contribution in December‚Äôs 2-0 win over Norwich City. ""I‚Äôm so excited and just can‚Äôt wait to get on the pitch, meet all the players and try to win games and trophies with Chelsea,"" he said. ""It‚Äôs been quite hectic but I couldn‚Äôt get Chelsea out of my head the last few days so I‚Äôm just happy and relieved that it‚Äôs all done.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-complete-signing-of-teenage-midfielder-carney-chukuemeka-/blt55c8a4d97abcda95,Soham Mukherjee,c521c43f-bb3d-48e9-8c3c-ac36da4425a8
Ex-Man Utd starlet Ravel Morrison reunites with Rooney as D.C. United sign midfielder on free transfer,"Former Manchester United starlet Ravel Morrison has reunited with Wayne Rooney once again, with D.C. United confirming the capture of the midfielder on a free transfer. His deal will run through 2023 with an option to extend to 2024. The two men were once team-mates at Old Trafford, while Morrison also played under Rooney at Derby County last season. Morrison was released by the Rams at the end of his contract, but has now followed his last manager to Audi Field. Rooney stepped into the dugout at D.C. United on July 12, having also played for the MLS franchise at the end of his career, and has since been busy working on recruitment to take the club to the next level. D.C. United's president of soccer operations, Dave Kasper, has said of Morrison's arrival: ""Wayne worked closely with Ravel during his time as manager of Derby County. ‚ÄúRavel is an incredible talent and his ability to create and score goals is impressive. He has played at the highest levels during his career and his vision, creativity and ability on the ball will be a huge asset for us."" Lucy Rushton, the club's general manager, added: ""Ravel is a dynamic and exciting player who has experience performing at the elite levels in Europe and Mexico. ‚ÄúHe is a top-class midfielder with excellent technical ability and positional versatility. His game intelligence and all-round attacking ability allow him to fit perfectly in the system and style that Wayne wants to play.  ""We look forward to integrating him with the roster and having him contribute on the field as soon as possible.‚Äù Welcome to the Black-and-Red Family, Ravel üëè#DCU || @MorrisonRavel D.C. United are the 13th club that Morrison has played for across his 12-year career, which began with a failed stint at Old Trafford between 2010 and 2012. The 29-year-old has also turned out in the Premier League for West Ham and Sheffield United, while spending four years on Lazio's books in Italy between 2015-19. Morrison impressed for Derby last term despite their relegation from the Championship, recording four goals and four assists in 36 appearances. GOAL's American soccer correspondent Ryan Tolmich writes... Morrison is a risk worth taking for D.C. United, who have officially begun the team's overhaul under Rooney. That overhaul began with the deal to send Julian Gressel to Vancouver and is continuing with the signing of Morrison, who rejoins a familiar face in Rooney. Morrison's career has been up and down, to put it lightly, but he did well enough under Rooney at Derby as he now looks to find some sort of stability under the former Man Utd star. Under Rooney, D.C. is expected to play in a 4-2-3-1 system, with Morrison joining a midfield group that includes Russell Canouse, Chris Durkin and Moses Nyeman. Initially reported to be a Designated Player, Morrison instead arrives on a more affordable contract, with All-Star Taxi Fountas the team's only DP player as things stand. That means Rooney and D.C. have plenty of wiggle room to upgrade the roster if ownership are willing to spend.  Jesse Lingard has been linked and the allure of playing for Rooney will certainly appeal to several players looking to make the move to MLS. With D.C. sitting dead last in the Eastern Conference, they'll need any new signings to be true difference makers if they hope to salvage their season. That includes the mercurial Morrison, who certainly has the quality to make his mark on MLS and perhaps even stay a while if things can go to plan.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-man-utd-ravel-morrison-reunites-rooney-d-c-united-sign/blt24df128dfc1f3747,James Westwood,2f9d1a1d-2f98-4750-bb62-adba6ff34259
Youthful Arsenal can be a real force and aim for top four - Parlour,"Former Arsenal star Ray Parlour believes the club‚Äôs current crop of young talent can see the club become a real Premier League force once again - and that a top-four finish is not yet out of reach this season. The ex Gunners midfielder was part of Arsene Wenger‚Äôs legendary Invincibles side that cruised to the Premier League title unbeaten in 2004. The club has gone through a number of transitional phases since then but Parlour believes coach Mikel Arteta‚Äôs young, vibrant squad can lead the club back to English football‚Äôs top table. ‚ÄúIt's a good young team. If they develop like they have been then they‚Äôve got an excellent opportunity of getting back into the top four,‚Äù said Parlour, who was hosting guests of the club‚Äôs official betting partner Sportsbet.io at Arsenal‚Äôs 2-1 victory over Brentford last month. ""There are some big games still to come: Chelsea away, Tottenham away, Manchester United, all the teams that are going to be around that sort of area. Arsenal have got themselves in a good position."" The Gunners have the youngest average of any squad in the Premier League this season, including a number of stars who have risen through the club‚Äôs youth ranks. ‚ÄúThe Academy has always been important,‚Äù said Parlour. ‚ÄúSeeing players come through like Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka, and also Martin Odegaard, they‚Äôre all very, very young. Aaron Ramsdale‚Äôs very young, too. ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs Ben White. If you look at the average age at the back, it‚Äôs 24, 25. So, if they can keep improving and keep listening to the coach and doing what he says, then hopefully they will have a very successful time.‚Äù Boss Mikel Areta has proved himself the coach for nurturing young talent, but Parlour believes the older members of the squad have a big role to play too. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to have that little bit of experience as well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be looking up to captain Alexandre Lacazette and Granit Xhaka, saying this is how you conduct yourself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to have your own mind as well, but you always listen to people older than you. I did when I was playing. ‚ÄúPeople like Tony Adams and people like that helped my career. So I‚Äôm sure the young players will be looking at Lacazette and people a little bit older to see what their experience has been as well.‚Äù Parlour believes the final piece of the puzzle is a top class striker, and that returning to the top four could be vital to securing the right man to lead the line. ‚ÄúThe transfer window is going to be very important in the summer, strikers-wise. But, if you can get fourth place, you can attract bigger players and champions league football next season. So, that‚Äôs going to be important.‚Äù As well as looking forward to the new, Parlour took a moment to look back. Asked what he would do with the current price of a bitcoin, the former England international said he‚Äôd honour former manager Arsene Wenger. ‚ÄúA statue of Arsene Wenger outside of the stadium. He developed this club so well,‚Äù said Parlour. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sitting here at the Emirates today and this is all down to Arsene. The new training ground is all down to Arsene. ""I‚Äôm amazed that there‚Äôs not a statue put up already. So my ¬£30,000 would go towards a statue of Arsene Wenger.‚Äù Ray Parlour was speaking to GOAL while hosting guests of Arsenal‚Äôs official betting partner, Sportsbet.io.

‚ÄòWhat a balls-up‚Äô ‚Äì Champions League draw fiasco stuns sporting world as Ronaldo vs Messi clash is wiped out,"The draw for the last 16 of the Champions League proved to be an eventful and rather chaotic affair, with Manchester United unwittingly finding themselves at the centre of a European storm after initially being paired with Paris Saint-Germain. That contest, which would have seen Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi rekindle their long-running rivalry, was eventually wiped out after UEFA admitted to a ‚Äútechnical problem‚Äù which forced them to carry out the entire procedure again. Unsurprisingly, interested observers from around the world were quick to ask questions of how European football‚Äôs governing body managed to find itself fire-fighting such a predicament. Just one tie had been pulled out of the hat when the last-16 draw descended into farce. Real Madrid had been paired with Benfica, before Villarreal became the third ball to be extracted from a pot of group-stage runners-up. Ex-Arsenal star Andrey Arshavin then proceeded to unfurl the name of Manchester United, but the Red Devils had already faced supposed La Liga opposition in this season‚Äôs competition. That error was quickly spotted, leading to Manchester City being lined up against Villarreal, but United were not added back in for the next tie to be drawn against Atletico Madrid ‚Äì as Bayern Munich were handed a heavyweight encounter with Spanish foes. The draw was eventually completed, with Messi and PSG left until last alongside Ronaldo and United, but concerns were already being raised behind the scenes, with Atletico among those to lodge an official complaint. UEFA then announced that the initial fixture list was null and void, with a second draw added to the schedule ‚Äì much to the annoyance of La Liga giants Real Madrid who were happy with their lot and had managed to steer clear of any scandal. Following a technical problem with the software of an external service provider that instructs the officials as to which teams are eligible to play each other, a material error occurred in the draw for the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. While condemnation of UEFA‚Äôs errors quietened quickly once an error of its ways had been acknowledged, the entire episode left many dazed and confused. What a balls-up.

PSG star Di Maria agrees one-year contract to join Juventus on free transfer,"Paris Saint-Germain star Angel Di Maria will join Juventus on a free transfer this summer, with GOAL confirming that he has agreed to a one-year contract at the Allianz Stadium. Di Maria has spent the last seven years of his career with PSG, winning a whole host of domestic trophies, but the club have decided against extending his contract beyond the summer. The 34-year-old will play his final game for the Ligue 1 champions against Metz on May 21 and is set to become a free agent the following month, with Juve poised to lure him to Italy. GOAL has learned that Juve have reached an agreement to sign Di Maria on a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season. The Italian giants will also have the option of keeping the Argentine for an extra year, with negotiations between all parties concerned having advanced quickly over the past 24 hours. PSG invested ‚Ç¨52 million (¬£44m/$65m) in Di Maria's talents in 2015 as they prised him away from Manchester United, which has ultimately proved to be a bargain deal. The veteran attacker has helped the club win five Ligue 1 titles, five Coupe de France crowns and three Trophee des Champions, while also playing a key role in their run to the 2019-20 Champions League final. Di Maria has contributed 92 goals to PSG's cause across 294 appearances, while also setting up another 118 for his team-mates, and will likely be remembered as one of the club's best players in recent years.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-di-maria-agrees-one-year-contract-juventus-free-transfer/blt7d771df0b090c285,Marc Mechenoua,df9cbd65-44f1-40cc-821a-08ca7246c662

The USWNT's January camp will take place in Austin, Texas from January 19-28, and will not include any matches.  ‚ÄúWithout any matches that we need to taper for, we can get in some more intense trainings and full-field scrimmages, which is great as we need to give this group as many chances as possible to play together in a national team environment,‚Äù Andonovski said in a federation press release.  Rodman is the youngest player on the roster and is followed by the top pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft, Naomi Girma, who is 21.

EA Sports vs Konami: How FIFA won the football gaming war against PES and eFootball ,"At one point on a Saturday night in early December, while 25,000 people on the streaming platform Twitch simultaneously tuned in to watch people play FIFA 22, only 19 watched the competing game eFootball 2022. The cultural gap between EA Sports‚Äô FIFA franchise and Konami‚Äôs eFootball - a rebrand of its once dominant Pro Evolution Soccer title - has grown wider than ever this year, with eFootball 2022 players looking like zombies and game mode options a skeleton of past iterations. Even Konami loyalists are having a difficult time justifying the use of their time on what is widely considered an incomplete game. For those faithful fans who have stuck around even as popularity waned since the mid-2000s glory years of PES, and who would like to keep supporting the game publisher, the recent setback has been particularly difficult to take. ‚ÄúI feel like they sold us a lot of hope, and what we got was very disappointing,‚Äù YouTube video maker Bryan Bryezer told GOAL about how the end product of eFootball 2022 compares to its pre-launch hype. ‚ÄúSo you know, it does feel like a slap in the face almost, because as a loyal PES fan you get the game every year. ""It's unbelievable, to be honest, a company with this much pedigree, releasing a game that's almost unplayable.‚Äù PES was once widely considered the better football simulation due to advanced game play immersion for its time and expansive customisation features. It didn‚Äôt carry the licensing breadth of EA but that never mattered. Nuances, such as an AI system that realistically punished poor decision-making, existed in those games that are not even fully realised today. But it‚Äôs been well over a decade since Konami outsold FIFA for a football game; in 2018, worldwide sales bottomed out at 550,000 copies compared to FIFA‚Äôs 12.2 million. This year, Konami has offered eFootball for free in a gambit to bring back some of its lost market share. The glitch-laden release, however, has done little to help bolster its public image. ‚ÄúWe are very sorry for the problems, and want to assure everyone we will take all concerns seriously and strive to improve the current situation,‚Äù wrote Konami in a statement amid the instant backlash to eFootball 2022. Konami has since promised a significant springtime update to its game, which is expected to bring back familiar game modes such as Master League and Become A Legend, as well as a new mobile launch. The company hopes these developments will begin to right the wrongs of eFootball 2022‚Äôs troubled release. But can it realistically make the game acceptable for users in a short time given its recent missteps, not only regaining hardcore supporters but also adding new ones? And even if the update improves matters significantly, would it be too late? To understand the context of Konami‚Äôs stake in football, it helps to look back at the history of its rivalry with EA Sports and the importance of console generation transitions like the one the video game world is in now.  Let‚Äôs start with Konami at its peak delivering one of its finest titles at the end of the life cycle of the PlayStation 2, which it had already dominated to that point. Maybe it‚Äôs just nostalgia talking, but many people will tell you the Japanese conglomerate offered one of the best, if not the best, football video game ever made in Pro Evolution Soccer 5 (also known as Winning Eleven 9) in August 2005.  ‚ÄúYou were fully immersed in the drama,‚Äù said Marlon Anthony, a YouTube creator who has done extensive documentary work on the history of PES and FIFA. ‚ÄúI think it was magic. It was magic in a bottle.‚Äù PES 5 received an 8.3 average user score on Metacritic; FIFA 06 came out the same year and received a 7.8. Anthony picks PES 5 out above the rest having gone back and played football games as far back as the 90s in order to document their evolution. Compared to more recent games, he said, the competitive intensity needed to succeed is refreshing. ‚ÄúThe player is rewarded for their patience and your opponent punished for bad decision making as well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúModern games try too much to make the player feel like they're [winning], and everything you want to do just happens for you, regardless of whether it could make sense for your players body shape, or for the team's positioning on the pitch.  ‚ÄúPES 5 was quite unforgiving in nature, you really had to work for your goals. And if you rushed a pass, or you rushed a shot, you understood why something failed. Whereas I think now regardless of the context, if the player requests to shoot, regardless of whether it makes sense, or whether it should be successful, nine times out of 10, it goes on target and is a goal. You kind of feel unfulfilled because you feel like you didn't even mean to shoot in that manner.‚Äù Knowing they had a dynamite product, Konami was extremely confident in this era and willing to take risks. It even put a referee on the cover of a game, and included a mode where one could swap human players for penguins and dinosaurs. ‚ÄúWe could do anything at that point,‚Äù former Konami public relations chief Steve Merrett told The Guardian of the company‚Äôs confidence level during the PlayStation 2 era. And for a while, they did. But once the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were released, ushering in an all-important next-gen transition period, EA Sports quickly took control of the playground. Around this time, FIFA became increasingly important to EA as the company consolidated its sports video game titles. It lost rights to MLB after 2005 and gave up on college baseball in 2007. By 2011, Take-Two Interactive had obliterated EA in basketball with the soaring NBA 2K series leaving EA‚Äôs NBA Live franchise far behind. By 2014, production of its popular NCAA Football game had stopped amid legal challenges. The desperation to succeed in football, then, led to an era of inventiveness and quick progress. FIFA 09 was not only arguably the most important title in modern football video game history, but also arguably the most consequential in modern sports game history, period. That‚Äôs because it introduced FIFA Ultimate Team - the build-your-fantasy-squad game mode featuring shiny virtual cards representing players usable in actual matches.  The game mode, as addictive as anything one will find in the sports gaming genre, is now a staple of other EA sports franchises as well as NBA 2K and San Diego Studios‚Äô MLB The Show. ‚ÄúObviously that was the big turning point where it was like, OK, it used to be about how the game played and how it looked and all this kind of stuff, and now it's about the fact that FIFA has Ultimate Team,‚Äù said game reviewer Jordan Oloman. ‚ÄúUltimate Team is the massive golden goose that is making all the money. And as you know, if you're a teenager, like I was when Ultimate Team first came out, it was the biggest thing ever. ‚ÄúIt's that cult of Ultimate Team that makes everyone play FIFA over PES.‚Äù Indeed, the gameplay itself in FIFA 09 wasn‚Äôt perfect, with online users quickly figuring out that goalkeepers could be chipped rather easily from any outside-the-box angle, including straight from kick-off. However, the implementation of new features such as Ultimate Team, as well as improvements to Career Mode, helped draw interest and laid the groundwork for total domination throughout the 2010s. EA Sports had hit its stride - and it didn't need to pay as much attention to the rival slipping behind it. ‚ÄúAfter FIFA 08 we didn‚Äôt really look towards PES,‚Äù acknowledged former FIFA lead designer Gary Paterson to The Guardian. ‚ÄúWe had so much we wanted to do. We spoke a lot about the shooting system, a more sophisticated version of what we‚Äôd created on PS2. The designers would talk about how the challenge is not to pass the ball once, but 15 times in order to create space for a shot.‚Äù Just as Konami had honed its product to near-perfection late in the PS2 lifecycle, EA Sports used the momentum of FIFA 09 to create games that pushed the outer limits of what was possible on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Starting around 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, EA began to unlock its vision of 360-degree player dribbling and passing control, eventually culminating in full freedom of movement that was desperately needed in football video games. PES would gain similar capabilities soon after, but it‚Äôs inconsistency from year to year during this period meant it could not offset the gains made by its rivals across the board. ‚ÄúEach game didn't just simply get better than the previous one, we'd have one game that would come along, and it would be, you know, somewhat, not industry changing, but it would be very, very influential, and it will be critically revered,‚Äù Anthony said. ‚ÄúAnd then the very next game would regress in so many ways.‚Äù To worsen matters for Konami, its inability to tap into the exploding cultural genre of YouTube and game streaming meant a disproportionate number of influencers were giving massive amounts of free publicity to FIFA. Videos of Ultimate Team pack openings that included live reactions garnered millions of views for accounts such as KSI, who now has more than 23 million YouTube subscribers having since branched into more mainstream cultural subject matter. In the years since, EA has made it a point to partner not only with YouTube stars but also with musicians and internationally famous athletes of other sports to help promote games. ‚ÄùThat [influencer culture] has obviously driven popularity to the maximum, to the point where now in FIFA 22, influencers and football stars were prioritised in the run-up to the game,‚Äù Oloman said. ‚ÄúThat influencer boom, YouTube boom, all kind of came around at the same time and a lot of influencers that are now more lifestyle brands like KSI and have music albums ‚Ä¶ but they rode up on this big wave of FIFA Ultimate Team.‚Äù It was enough of a perfect storm for EA that the next-gen transition in 2013 from the PS3 and Xbox 360 to the PS4 and Xbox One came and went without significant inroads from Konami. The gap in sales in 2009 was just 1.8 million copies; by 2018 it was more than 12 million. In retreat for more than a decade and having failed to capitalise on the previous console transition, eFootball 2022 on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S marked an opportunity for Konami to use a console transition to fuel the start of a comeback. After all, EA has itself been accused of over-reliance on the Ultimate Team formula that brought popularity and profits in abundance when it first emerged. Aspects of the pack opening system, Oloman said, are predatory, with users drawn to loot boxes with low chances of acquiring desirable cards. An EA official disputed that notion, however, telling GOAL: ‚ÄúSpending is entirely optional in our game. Players can open FUT packs by earning rewards through gameplay and that‚Äôs how most choose to do it - more than three quarters of FIFA 21 players didn't spend in game, and nine out of 10 FUT packs opened in FIFA 21 were earned rather than purchased. ‚ÄúUltimately, it is a game of skill and we spend tremendous amounts of time and resources to ensure that long-term success in-game is determined by gameplay.  ‚ÄúWe wholeheartedly believe that Ultimate Team and FUT Packs, which have been part of the game for more than a decade, are a part of FIFA that players love and we will continue to listen to our community and invest in the game to make it better for everyone.‚Äù Not only has Konami not created a viable alternative to EA‚Äôs model this year, pouncing on the criticism levied on its counterpart, but its springtime game update pending, the company has fallen further behind amid a period that has historically been of vital importance. As Konami starts the latest next-gen cycle wrong-footed, EA Sports intends to capitalise with a fast-moving business approach. ‚ÄúWhen we kind of interact with our hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe,‚Äù CEO Andrew Wilson said on a recent earnings call. ‚ÄúThey want more [experiences] inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11-on-11 football. They want more digital experiences outside the game, esports, NFTs, broader sports consumption and they want us to move really, really quickly.‚Äù It remains to be seen, of course, whether that promise to continue improving the product rather than becoming complacent will actually come true. And while EA Sports has for all of its criticism been the more revolutionary company since the PlayStation 3 came out, Konami has had its brilliant moments as well, albeit mostly longer ago than its rival. A return to top form from Konami, as unlikely as it might seem right now in the wake of eFootball 22, would hardly be met by silence. Take Dylan Yo, for example, a self-described football gaming fanatic with an affinity for retro titles born from a childhood spent with Nintendo World Cup, two controllers and his brother, who in adulthood still gives crooked thumbs ups to reference the mangled way his hand would look after long basement sessions pressing the sprint trigger. The New Mexico, United States, native has long been a member of the FIFA clan and currently sees little reason to leave. But that doesn‚Äôt mean he wouldn‚Äôt. Football video games, after all, can transcend the strict tribalism of the sport they simulate. ‚ÄúHonestly, I'd be willing to one day make the switch [to PES],‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI mean, I'm not honorbound. If there's a better game that comes out, and it's soccer related, I‚Äôd try to play it because I'm more about having fun. You know, my days of super competitiveness are over. I just want to have a good time.‚Äù For many, the co-existence of FIFA and a Konami title, be it PES or eFootball, creates a competitive marketplace that can only make things more enjoyable for the consumer. After all, the duel between studios has at times bred innovation that has influenced all sports games. ‚ÄúThey are both essential to each other, even though many people now would probably consider there isn't really a rivalry anymore,‚Äù Anthony, the documentary creator, said. ‚ÄúI still think it's important for them to both exist, I wouldn't want to see either of them go out of business, even though Konami has suffered really badly with the disastrous launch of eFootball. There‚Äôs still time for them to turn around and come back into this..‚Äù ‚ÄúA harsh lesson has to be learned from the people who made the decision to release the game in the state that it did. ‚Ä¶ The humiliation was needed.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/konami-ea-sports-efootball-2022-video-game-rivalry/blt6bcef7c77d0e0e10,Dan Bernstein,7af0d25f-6ddf-47e1-8eff-f8bf1afa6449

"'Liverpool are a pain in the a**' - Reds can still stop Man City dominance this season, says Guardiola","Liverpool can still stop Manchester City from dominating on all fronts this season, says Pep Guardiola, who has described his team's Premier League rivals as a ""pain in the a**"". City are looking good for silverware in multiple competitions once again this season - they have a nine-point lead over nearest rivals Liverpool in the Premier League, and are on the verge of the Champions League quarter-finals after thumping Sporting CP 5-0 away in the first leg of their round of 16 tie. However, City boss Guardiola is taking nothing for granted - especially when it comes to the Reds. When asked after the win in Lisbon on Tuesday night who can stop his team this season, Guardiola said: ""Liverpool. They are our biggest rivals in the last few seasons, they are always there. ""They are a pain in the a** all the time. They are a fantastic team."" It will take quite something for Liverpool to deny City the Premier League title, with the Reds trailing the leaders by nine points, albeit with a game in hand. The teams are currently scheduled to meet at Etihad Stadium on April 9, but Jurgen Klopp's team are relying on Guardiola's men dropping points elsewhere to keep the title race alive.

Chelsea boss Tuchel admits 'mixed feeling' about Carabao Cup amid Ukraine crisis,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel admits that events in Ukraine are weighing on his conscience as he attempts to prepare for Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Liverpool.

On Saturday, moreover, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who is Russian, signalled his intention to step back from operations and hand over stewardship of the club to trustees.  ‚ÄúClearly [the match will act as a distraction], but still, because the war is so close, so fresh, maybe it comes with a little bit of a bad conscience on Sunday,‚Äù Tuchel signalled to reporters in the build-up to the game.  ‚ÄúLike, are we allowed to fully engage, fully celebrate?

Champions League final 2021-22: Why venue has changed after Russia invasion of Ukraine & where UEFA showpiece will be played instead,"What does the Russian invasion of Ukraine mean for the 2021-22 Champions League final? Well, it will no longer be staged in Saint Petersburg as UEFA has announced a change in venue to Stade de France in Paris. The last time Russia staged the European showpiece was back in 2008, when Manchester United lifted the trophy following a penalty shootout victory at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.¬† The transcontinental country was given hosting rights again for this season's final, but political tension which has resulted in military action has changed the landscape. GOAL is here to bring you everything you need to know. The 2021-22 Champions League final was originally set to be staged at the Gazprom Arena in Saint Petersburg, which is the home ground of Russian giants Zenit. However, that situation has changed following an annoucement from UEFA on February 25 and the game will now be held at Stade de France in Paris. UEFA have decided to relocate the final of the 2021/22 UEFA Men‚Äôs Champions League from Russia to France. The Stade de France will now host the final. pic.twitter.com/FtDesDaYAR The 2022 Champions League final is scheduled to take place on May 28, 2022. It was suggested that Russia may not be allowed to stage the Champions League final from the moment that president Vladimir Putin gave the green light for an invasion of Ukraine. According to U.S estimates, Russia had stationed 150,000 troops along Ukraine's borders over the last few months. The situation escalated on February 22 as Putin announced the recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states and moved soldiers into the two rebel-held regions. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid¬†announced the following morning that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had begun. ""We are waking up to a very dark day in Europe,"" Javid said on Sky News. ""We‚Äôve seen that he‚Äôs [Putin] recognised these breakaway eastern regions in Ukraine and we can already tell he‚Äôs sent in tanks and troops, so I think from that you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun.‚Äù The British media reported that Russia would have no choice but to give up the Champions League final as the situation continues to develop, but St Petersburg local organising committee chief Alexey Sorokin initially insisted that the game would go ahead as planned. ‚ÄúWe do not pay attention to various comments from the British media,‚Äù¬†Sorokin told¬†TASS.¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been dealing with this for the last 15 years ‚Äì since 2008, when something was supposedly going to be taken from us,‚Äù¬†the official added, referring to when Russia held the Champions League final in Moscow in 2008. ‚ÄúUEFA is a large international sports organisation, it operates outside a political context.

"Senegal vs Egypt: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Senegal hope to improve on their last appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations by taking the trophy home with a win against Egypt in Sunday's final. Senegal have never won the Afcon as they were beaten by Algeria in the 2019 final and are coming up against the tournament's most successful team. Egypt have seven titles to their name and, while they have not won it since 2010, they did finish second in 2017. The last time these sides met was in 2014, with Senegal winning the last two matches between them.  They have not lost a single match at this year's Afcon and are 11/10 (2.10) favourites with bet365 to get the win here, too.  Egypt, meanwhile, are available at 10/3 (4.33) to win the match and the draw is priced at 19/10 (2.90). Senegal hero Sadio Mane is the shortest odds to score the first goal at 7/2 (4.5), while Miame Thiam is 11/2 (6.5).  Mohamed Salah is also priced at 11/2 (6.5) to break the deadlock in Egypt's favour. Senegal have hit top form in the knockout stages of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, beating each of Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea and Burkina Faso by two goals. Senegal can field their strongest XI for the final as they do not have any players missing through injury or suspension. While Egypt have won every game since their opening match defeat to Nigeria, they have had to grind out results by being strong defensively and excellent in penalty shootouts. Goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy is still struggling with an injury, meaning Mohamed Abou Gabal will likely be given the nod to start the final. Ahmed Agazy is still a doubt for the seven-time champions, so Mahmoud Hamdi El Wensh could keep his place in defence. We could be in for a tight and nervy final as Egypt will be as tough to beat as always, so backing under 2.5 goals at 4/11 (1.36) may be a good bet despite the short odds.

'Back to the origins!' - Pique explains Barcelona's vibrant win over Napoli,"Barcelona centre-back Gerard Pique has explained the team's 4-2 Europa League win over Napoli on Thursday as going ""back to the origins"" of what makes the club great. Specifically, he has hailed Xavi's possession-based tactics as being influential in their success. Pique was one of four different goalscorers in the match as Barcelona advanced to the last 16 with a 5-3 aggregate edge. ""We went back to the origins, to have the ball,"" Pique told reporters when asked what led to the Spanish giants' triumph at Diego Armando Maradona Stadium. ""For a while we stopped doing it. Who was to blame? A little bit of everyone, it's not fair to target anyone. Decisions were made that were not appropriate. ""Many things have changed since Bayern. Now there is a base in which the team feels confident. We have reinforced very well in January, now we have real weapons up front. ""All that is happening is a continuous improvement in the game, which sometimes translates into good results and sometimes not, but the line is ascending. I'm convinced that this trend will take us to a good position and we will see in the Europa League."" Xavi has implemented the kind of possession-orientated tactics he once used as a player at Barcelona, and on Thursday, his side held 56 per cent of the ball against Napoli. The slick, fast-paced approach is more pronounced than it was under the watch of Ronald Koeman, who was sacked earlier in the campaign. Beyond tactics, Xavi and left-back Jordi Alba have hailed the courage in the team and said their fighting spirit has helped achieve positive results. Still, it's been a difficult season for the Blaugrana as they're in fourth place in La Liga and not competing in the Champions League.

Queiroz fumes at Afcon referees after Salah's Egypt book final date with Mane's Senegal,"Egypt head coach Carlos Queiroz slammed Afcon officials after receiving a red card during his side's semi-final win over Cameroon. Host nation Cameroon were sent crashing out of the tournament on Thursday night after losing on penalties to Egypt following a goalless 120 minutes of action. One of the biggest talking points of the game came when Queiroz was sent to the stands after remonstrating with head referee Bakary Gassama late in the second half of normal time, and he vented his fury to reporters post-match. ""Again, unfortunately, they send this type of referees to a game of this level, referees with no experience, no level, wanting to put on a show... It started right in the dressing room,"" said the Portuguese manager. ""We hadn't started the game yet and he comes to the locker room to intimidate our staff.¬†But even against this, against all the decisions, which were always against Egypt, we were the best team in the second half and on penalties."" Queiroz added on the overall treatment of his squad from officials and organisers throughout the tournament: ""CAF doesn't respect Egypt, from the timings to the quality of the pitches - we had the worst pitches!¬†We are Egypt!¬† ""How can this referee, after what he has done in the past, be in the African Cup of Nations?¬†Who understands this?¬†Nobody!"" Queiroz's assistant Diaa Al-Sayed also stoked up controversy after the game by calling for Afcon chiefs to push Egypt's final date with Senegal back to Monday. Egypt also needed extra time and penalties to beat the Ivory Cost in the last eight and went to extra time against Morroco in the round of 16. Al-Sayed feels Egypt deserve more time to rest for the showpiece event, which is currently scheduled for Sunday and will see Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah face off against each other.  ""I want to state to all CAF authorities that Senegal have one extra day to train and therefore maybe we should play the final on Monday,"" he told the media.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/queiroz-afcon-referees-salah-egypt-final-mane-senegal/blt9683197a1a93ddcf,James Westwood,db4ac7b1-d5d9-41ae-8d56-bd0c8df16839
Eto‚Äôo: Fifa reminisces about Cameroon legend‚Äôs record-breaking Afcon brace,"Fifa has paid tribute to Samuel Eto‚Äôo for his record-breaking Africa Cup of Nations goal. Exactly 14 years ago at the Tamale Stadium in Ghana, the four-time African Player of the Year found the net twice as Cameroon subdued Sudan 3-0 in their last group game. #OnThisDay on 30 January 2008, @SamuelEtoo üá®üá≤ scored twice against Sudan to break the record as all-time leading scorer at the AFCON.#TeamCameroon pic.twitter.com/auCorHfXLf ‚ÄúOn this day on 30 January 2008, Samuel Eto‚Äôo scored twice against Sudan to break the record as all-time leading scorer at the Afcon,‚Äù tweeted Fifa. Needing a win against the Falcons of Jediane to advance, Eto‚Äôo put the Indomitable Lions ahead from the penalty spot before completing his brace in the 90th minute. That feat saw him eclipse Laurent Pokou‚Äôs 14-goal mark in the biennial African football showpiece to become the highest goal scorer in the competition‚Äôs history. Cameroon reached the final of the competition, but lost 1-0 to Egypt with Mohamed Aboutrika‚Äôs 76th-minute effort deciding the game at the Ohene Djan Stadium in Accra. Eto‚Äôo consolation was winning the Golden Boot prize after scoring five goals, although surprisingly he was not named among the tournament‚Äôs best XI. At Angola 2010, the striker scored twice to take his tally in the tournament to 18 goals from six tournament appearances ‚Äì a record which stands to date. Eto‚Äôo retired from football at the age of 38 since making his senior debut in 1997, scoring more than 350 goals across his club career, winning the Champions League twice with Barcelona and once with Inter Milan. With two Afcon diadems and an Olympic gold medal to his name, he is an undisputed icon of African football and retired with 56 goals in 118 games for his country. After spending his youth at the Kadje Sports Academy in Cameroon, Eto‚Äôo was signed by Real Madrid as a youngster but only made three league appearances for the club‚Äôs first team.¬† Following a successful loan spell in 2000, he signed for Mallorca, where a record of 54 goals in 133 league games earned him a move to Barcelona in the summer of 2004.¬† He shone immediately for the Catalan giants, scoring 25 league goals in his first season and 26 in his second as Barca won back-to-back Spanish titles ‚Äì their first of the new millennium. His brilliance saw him come third in the 2005 Fifa World Player of the Year award, behind Brazil‚Äôs Ronaldinho and England's Frank Lampard.¬† In 2021, the African football icon saw off interim boss Seidou Mbombo Njoya to become president of the Cameroonian Football Federation (Fecafoot).¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/eto-o-fifa-reminisces-about-cameroon-legend-record-breaking/blt98a43464dc9effd9,Shina Oludare,4dfbb488-15ba-4612-b09f-bc3551bd729c
"'As a Parisian Liverpool fan, it breaks my heart' - Inside the horror of the Champions League final","For Camelia Abdennbi-Bohills, Saturday was supposed to be one of the proudest days of her life. As a French Liverpool supporter, born and raised in Paris, the idea of her club playing a Champions League final in her home city was one she had dreamed of for yours. Four days on, though, she and her fellow Reds are still coming to terms with just how badly things went wrong at the Stade de France. The fallout continues. UEFA has already commissioned an independent investigation into events, more than 5000 Liverpool fans have submitted online forms detailing their experiences, while Reds chairman Tom Werner has written to Gerald Darmanin, the French interior minister, demanding an apology for what he described as ‚Äúirresponsible, unprofessional and wholly disrespectful‚Äù comments made about supporters in the aftermath of Saturday‚Äôs game. Both Darmanin and Amelie Oudea-Castera, the French sports minister, stated on Monday that the chaos outside the Stade de France, in which fans were crushed in queues outside entrances and then attacked with tear gas and pepper spray by police, had been the result of a large-scale ticket fraud.¬† Darmanin even suggested that as many as 40,000 supporters had arrived with ‚Äúfake tickets or no tickets‚Äù, a claim that was swiftly debunked by Stade de France officials, who confirmed to AFP that less than 3,000 fake tickets had been scanned ahead of the game. Both Darmanin and Oudea-Castera were due to appear before the French senate on Wednesday afternoon, where they would be questioned on events before, during and after the final ‚Äì and, in particular, the breakdown in policing and stewarding outside the stadium. Our CEO Billy Hogan has tonight provided a further update on the club‚Äôs response to the issues experienced by fans at the Champions League final in Paris. For Abdennbi-Bohills, the feeling is one of sadness, as well as anger. She is a member of the French branch of the Official Liverpool Supporters Club, and was caught up in the chaos outside the Stade de France. She had a panic attack while queuing for more than two hours to enter the stadium, and says only the kindness and support of fellow Liverpool fans got her through the experience. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had a panic attack before in my life,‚Äù she tells GOAL. ‚ÄúBut I know from experience what policing of football supporters is like in France. They are aggressive, and things can often escalate when they don‚Äôt need to. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mum, I have a three-year-old, and the longer it went on outside the ground, the more tense and scared I became. ‚ÄúThe people around us were incredible. They were so kind. There was a young woman and her mum and she was amazing, they kept asking if I was OK. They calmed me down and looked after me. ‚ÄúHonestly, had the crowd reacted in a different manner, I dread to think what could have happened.‚Äù Abdennbi-Bohills‚Äô mother lives around a kilometre away from the Stade de France, while she herself went to school at Cours de Vincennes, where Liverpool‚Äôs fanpark was based last Saturday.¬† She has attended several fixtures at Stade de France in the past, including Six Nations rugby matches and Euro 2016 games. Those, she says, were a world removed from last Saturday, when it came to policing, stewarding and the general treatment of spectators.¬† ‚ÄúWhat is it they say; the one who is lying is the one who changes their story?‚ÄúFirst it was late arrivals, then it was fake tickets. I‚Äôm just surprised they didn‚Äôt use drunkenness as an excuse, for the full house.‚Äù#LFC #UCLfinal https://t.co/rlpAmIDg4a ‚ÄúThere is definitely an attitude of aggression towards English fans, I can say that for sure,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEven if you take rugby, if it is Irish or Scottish or Welsh fans, it‚Äôs different.¬† ‚ÄúI attended Ireland against Sweden at Euro 2016, and it was a different attitude. Friendlier, calmer. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a bigger problem than [just] the attitude towards English fans, in my opinion. ""It‚Äôs a matter of how they police games generally, and anyone who attends games in France will say that I‚Äôm sure. It has gotten worse in the last four or five years too. ‚ÄúFans are viewed as thugs who are going to create problems. And if you go with that attitude, then it is more likely that problems will arise. ‚ÄúI heard someone say on French TV that it was as if they were policing English fans from 40 years ago, and that is how it was. ""I consider myself one of the lucky ones, but a lot of fans are traumatised by what they experienced and, as a Parisien, that breaks my heart.‚Äù She adds: ‚ÄúIt hurts, because it was a big celebration for us. On Friday, we hosted a party with The Anfield Wrap and the LFC Red Indians, and it was fantastic.¬† ‚ÄúThe fanpark on Saturday was incredible. It was amazing to see Liverpool fans all over my home town. ""Then, to see and hear that they then had such an awful experience, that Hillsborough survivors have had memories triggered and all these things, it is devastating.¬† ‚ÄúLiverpool is my club, France is my country, and it hurts me to think that my country wasn‚Äôt able to host them and to make them feel safe. ""To hear people saying they never want to come to Paris again, it‚Äôs just not right.‚Äù To the Liverpool fans in Paris, what happened to you was disgraceful. You deserve so much better and now answers must follow. Hope you all got home safe ‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/ix24OzEBi2 Abdennbi-Bohills, at least, says she has been heartened to see widespread condemnation of the authorities, and of UEFA, in the French media, where the likes of Darmanin and Oudea-Castera have been heavily criticised and where first-hand accounts from supporters have rightly been given prominence. ‚ÄúThe media have been condemning,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTo add some context, there are parliamentary elections coming up, so people are always going to be keen to go against the government and push their own agenda, but generally there has been a lot of support and sympathy for supporters. ‚ÄúWith that [Darmanin/Oudea-Castera] press conference, I think anyone could see ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt right.' Once you look into the details, it‚Äôs obvious.¬† ‚ÄúSome people will believe them, which is sad, but from the people I know, the reaction was disgust. They wanted to change the narrative.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from the Hillsborough playbook of how to spread the lie. We‚Äôve seen it before, and it‚Äôs disgusting. ‚ÄúOur chairman, Rodo, has been on a few important TV shows talking about what happened. I myself was on TV5 and Monde, just to give my account of things.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to make sure fans have a voice in the French media. The message is coming stronger towards the Liverpool fans, that it was bad organisation and policing, not fake tickets and fans arriving late.‚Äù She adds: ‚ÄúI just hope that one day the people will come back to Paris and see us. They will always be welcome. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just heartbreaking to know that so many good people had their experience in my city ruined. It‚Äôs not right, and I just wish the French government would apologise and accept responsibility.¬† ‚ÄúBut sadly they don‚Äôt, and they won‚Äôt, because politics will come into play.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/parisian-liverpool-fan-breaks-my-heart-inside-horror/blte7681ce18018a71d,Neil Jones,81d261e8-76f7-45d1-b924-6ad2340a901d
Scholes brands Man Utd a 'poisonous mess' & urges them to sign Conte from Tottenham,"Paul Scholes has branded Manchester United a ""poisonous mess"" while urging his former club to try and steal Antonio Conte away from Tottenham in the summer. United have endured a miserable 2021-22 campaign so far, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer paying for the team's poor start with his job and his interim replacement Ralf Rangnick also failing to get the best out of an enigmatic group. The Red Devils are now in real danger of finishing outside of the top four and extending their trophyless run to five seasons, and Scholes cannot envisage the situation improving any time soon. The former United midfielder, who made over 700 appearances for the club between 1993 and 2013, has said on the Webby and O‚ÄôNeill YouTube channel: ""The club just feels like it‚Äôs in a mess, player, staff and manager wise. ""Who wants to come into this club? It feels like a right mess. It does feel poisonous.‚Äù Scholes added on the lack of quality in Rangnick's ranks: ""It has to come a point where you think, ‚ÄòAre these players good enough?' ‚ÄúWe know [Cristiano] Ronaldo, [Paul] Pogba, [Raphael] Varane, [Nemanja] Matic have great experience and won trophies but the rest of the squad haven‚Äôt proven themselves to be good enough to win anything. ‚ÄúSome of these players have had a lot of games now. Marcus Rashford, he‚Äôs had a lot of games, are we ever going to see these lads reach their potential? ‚ÄúAre they ever going to be good enough to win trophies? [Harry] Maguire, is he good enough? [Victor] Lindelof, is he good enough? ‚ÄúWe keep saying how good they are but they are failing to produce what is required on the pitch.‚Äù Scholes went on to question Rangnick's suitability for the top job at Old Trafford, with the former RB Leipzig and Schalke manager considered to be lacking experience at the highest level of the game. ‚ÄúWe have gone to a man well regarded across Europe, especially by managers who speak highly of him like [Jurgen] Klopp and [Thomas] Tuchel,"" he said of the German tactician. ""But he‚Äôs not had much success as a coach. ‚ÄúHe won promotion in Germany and a bit with Schalke but he has been asked to come and manage the biggest club in the world - it's something I just cannot get my head round. ‚ÄúThey should have the best available out there as their manager. They haven‚Äôt got that and I find that astonishing. ‚ÄúWe should have one of the top five managers in the world. Now, Tuchel, [Pep] Guardiola and Klopp are the top three but they are unavailable, there is no chance of getting them. But then you look at Antonio Conte."" Scholes sees Conte as the ideal man to turn United's fortunes around and thinks the Italian could be persuaded to leave Spurs at the end of the season if he is not backed in the transfer market. ""Some people say he was not suited to United but you have seen what he is doing at Tottenham with a squad that is nowhere near as good as¬†United‚Äôs,"" he added. ‚ÄúHe will probably challenge for the top four and United missed a trick with him. They could probably still get him from Tottenham. Tottenham fans probably won‚Äôt like me for saying that. > ‚ÄúYou can see he is already getting frustrated with his squad of players and is asking for other stuff.¬† Conte could do something special here, he has got the pedigree to do it.

Akanji joins Man City in ¬£15m transfer as Premier League champions snap up Swiss defender from Borussia Dortmund,"WHAT HAPPENED? The 27-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the reigning Premier League champions through to the summer of 2027. He will add even greater depth to a star-studded squad at the Etihad Stadium that already includes centre-half options such as Ruben Dias, John Stones and Aymeric Laporte. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Akanji has spent the last four-and-a-half years in Germany, taking in 158 appearances for Dortmund. He has 41 caps for Switzerland to his name and will be another experienced option for Pep Guardiola to call upon - with it announced that he will be taking on the Blues' No.25 shirt. IN THREE PHOTOS:   WHAT THEY SAID: Akanji has said: ""I am delighted to be here and can‚Äôt wait to get started. City have been one of the best teams in Europe over the last few seasons. They are brilliant to watch, play an exciting brand of football and compete for trophies year in, year out, so coming here feels like the perfect next step in my career. Pep Guardiola is an exceptional manager and this is an exceptional squad of players, so this is an exciting opportunity for me. I am really looking forward to testing myself in the Premier League and I will do everything I can to help this club be successful."" THE VERDICT: GOAL's Man City correspondent, Jonathan Smith, says: ""Even Akanji admitted the move to City was 'a bit unexpected', particularly after Guardiola said that transfer business was done for the window. City have four senior centre-backs but injuries to Aymeric Laporte and Nathan Ake have stretched resources and left them with just John Stones and Ruben Dias.  ""But with such an intense pre-World Cup schedule, City clearly think it's an area where they need extra protection, particularly after last season when they almost blew the title in the final weeks of the season when they were short of cover. With the rest of the squad starting so well, the centre of defence is a position where they can afford to be overly cautious and in Akanji they have have an experienced option, for a good price who can quickly settle into the team."" WHAT NEXT FOR MAN CITY? The Blues are not expected to be too busy on deadline day, with an unbeaten start to the 2022-23 Premier League season suggesting that they are well placed to defend a domestic crown.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/akanji-man-city-15m-transfer-premier-league-defender/blt213170dfeaee722a,Chris Burton,7257267e-7d1f-4ae7-8e10-c5e93bcd0077
Ibrahimovic: For six months I played without an ACL in my left knee,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed that he has been playing for AC Milan without an anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee for the past six months. Ibrahimovic's involvement in Milan's Serie A title-winning campaign was reduced because of recurring injury problems. The striker has now been ruled out until 2023 after having an operation to reconstruct the cruciate ligament. The 40-year-old discussed the extent of his suffering over the last six months in an Instagram post on Thursday. ""For the past six months, I played without an ACL in my left knee,"" Ibrahimovic wrote. ""Swollen knee for six months. I was only able to train with the team 10 times in the last six months. ""Took more than 20 injections in six months. Emptied the knee once a week for six months. Painkillers every day for six months. Barely slept for six months because of the pain. ""Never suffered so much on and off the pitch. I made something impossible to something possible. ""In my mind I had only one objective, to make my teammates and coach champions of Italy because I made them a promise. ""Today I have a new ACL and another trophy."" Ibrahimovic scored eight Serie A goals in 23 appearances, 11 of which he started this season. The Sweden international helped end Milan's 11-year wait for a Serie A title as they beat Sassuolo on the final day of the season. It is not clear if the attacker will return to the game after he recovers from his operation as his contract with Milan expires this summer. In March, Ibrahimovic discussed the prospect of retiring and admitted that the thought gives him a ""sense of panic"", adding: ""I will certainly keep playing for as long as possible, as long as I can get results and am not suffering. ""I want to end my career without regrets, so I have to maximise my time.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ibrahimovic-for-six-months-i-played-without-an-acl-in-my/blt3da205dcc82e988a,Peter McVitie,992b8ece-cc3f-4a45-a7bb-6343f7c4c4a2
"Liverpool vs Newcastle United: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Liverpool will be aiming to extend their strong recent run when they welcome Newcastle United to Anfield for Thursday‚Äôs Premier League clash. Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men have won each of their last seven fixtures in all competitions and go into this match four points adrift of leaders Manchester City with a game in hand. Unbeaten in 25 home games against this opposition, Liverpool are clear 1/8 (1.13) favourites with bet365 to maintain the pressure by coming out on top yet again. Newcastle have lost five and won none of their eight league away matches this season and are 18/1 (19.0) outsiders to secure a first victory at this ground since 1994. Both encounters between this duo last season resulted in draws, and you can get odds of 8/1 (9.0) on them cancelling each other out once more. Mohamed Salah is the obvious first goalscorer bet at 11/5 (3.20) after hitting the net 21 times in 22 appearances this campaign, with Sadio Mane priced at 4/1 (5.0) after a run of six games without a goal. Top scorer Callum Wilson is the visitors' 12/1 (13.0) favourite to open the scoring with a seventh league goal of the season, while Allan Saint-Maximin offers tempting value at a lengthy 25/1 (26.0). While they eventually collapsed to a 4-0 defeat against Leicester, Eddie Howe‚Äôs side went in only a goal behind at the break at the King Power Stadium on Sunday. In fact, Youri Tielemans‚Äô penalty is the only first-half goal they have conceded in four matches since their new manager took his place on the sidelines - conceding six out of seven goals in the second period so far. They will therefore back themselves to frustrate a Reds team that have struggled for a breakthrough in the last couple of matches, grabbing a 94th-minute winner at Wolves before needing a second-half penalty to see off Aston Villa in successive 1-0 league victories. With Liverpool clearly not quite at full speed during this hectic December period, odds of 20/21 (1.95) offer decent value on Newcastle ensuring the majority of goals aren‚Äôt scored until after half-time for their fourth game in five. All odds correct at time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

FIFA rules out changes to playing time ahead of 2022 World Cup,"FIFA has denied it is considering altering its calculation of playing and stoppage times prior to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.  Widespread media reports had suggested that the governing body might make changes in order to ensure fans get to see the ball in play more often.  But if such a decision is in the pipeline, FIFA insists it will not be introduced before the finals kick off.  ""Following some reports and rumours spread today, FIFA would like to clarify that there will be no changes to the rules regarding the length of football matches for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 or any other competition,"" the organisation indicated on its official Twitter account. FIFA StatementFollowing some reports and rumours spread today, FIFA would like to clarify that there will be no changes to the rules regarding the length of football matches for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022‚Ñ¢Ô∏è or any other competition. According to a report in Corriere dello Sport, FIFA chief Gianni Infantino had been considering extending games up to 100 minutes or longer in order to force more action.  The rumoured new measures would include giving referees more power to enforce longer stoppage time, which at the current time is restricted primarily to injuries, VAR checks and other significant delays.  Studies have concluded that while a football match lasts 90 minutes, the ball spends much less time in play.  The CIES Football Observatory found that the average time in play for a Champions League match is only 60.2 per cent, while it is not uncommon for a game to be in motion for just 45 minutes, or half, of the full 90.

Ex-Man Utd & City star Tevez takes first management job at Argentine outfit Rosario Central,"Former Manchester United, West Ham, Juventus and Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez is taking his first steps into management after inheriting the reins at Argentine outfit Rosario Central. The 38-year-old announced his retirement from playing in June 2022, following the death of his father, and is now taking on a new challenge as coaching teeth are cut in his homeland. There had been some confusion as to whether Tevez had the qualification required in order to become a boss at Rosario, but a deal has been announced and he will be taking his boundless energy into the dugout. A man that earned 76 caps for Argentina in his playing days is looking forward to putting his tactical acumen to the test. Tevez has previously said of moving into management: ‚ÄúI am really excited about the project I am putting together with my brothers and Chapa Retegui. ‚ÄúI have decided to coach. ‚ÄúWe have been working together for four or five months and we are putting together a really good, global project. I am really into this.‚Äù üìùüòÑ ¬°Carlos T√©vez es el DT de #RosarioCentral!El Apache se convirti√≥ en el nuevo entrenador auriazul, tras firmar contrato con el Club por 12 meses.

He started and ended his playing career on the books at Boca Juniors, with 94 goals recorded for the Argentine giants across three spells. Tevez first left his homeland in 2005 when making the short switch to Brazil at Corinthians, but headed to Europe in 2006 when making a shock transfer to West Ham. Cult hero status was earned in east London, with one memorable goal hoping to preserve the Hammers‚Äô Premier League status, but he did enough across 12 months to attract interest from Manchester United. He played under the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, helping the Red Devils to two Premier League titles and a Champions League crown. More headlines were then made on the transfer front in 2019 when crossing Manchester to link up with United‚Äôs arch-rivals at City. Tevez hit 73 goals for the Blues through 148 appearances, claiming another Premier League title along the way and an FA Cup winners‚Äô medal. Two years in Italy at Juventus followed, before an initial return to his roots at Boca was made. A lucrative contract offer took him to China at Shanghai Shenhua in 2017, but that move never looked like working out and he was soon back at La Bombonera. As his game time and output began to dwindle, Tevez severed ties with Boca in 2021 and had been without a club when announcing his retirement.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-city-tevez-first-management-job-rosario-central/blt6ce9c8b475d3f92d,Chris Burton,7b579d1b-2d1b-4cfd-8cf0-8e029d822385
Draxler admits unhappiness at PSG: 'My situation at the club is not easy',"Julian Draxler admits he is going through a difficult period at Paris Saint-Germain because of his lack of playing time. The attacking midfielder featured for Germany as they beat Israel 2-0 last week, the first time he has played a full match since a Coupe de France clash in January. The 28-year-old has made just 18 appearances in Ligue 1 this year, having fallen down the pecking order with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Angel Di Maria ahead of him. Draxler hopes to be part of the Germany squad for the World Cup in Qatar in November, but he is aware he might need to leave PSG in order to stay in contention for a place. ""I am happy to have played 90 minutes for the first time in a long time. I am still convinced that I have the quality for this team,"" he told the official Ligue 1 website. ""My situation at the club is not easy. I lack rhythm."" He added: ""I haven't spoken to the coach [Hansi Flick] personally, but he has already told us, as a team, that he needs players who are fit, who are in the rhythm.  ""I need to play more games for the World Cup. We'll see what happens this summer."" The Germany international joined the French giants from Wolfsburg in 2017 and has made almost 200 appearances overall. He signed a new contract with the club last year, extending his commitment until 2024. However, his playing time has been dwindling since the 2019-20 season. This year he has started just eight of the 24 appearances he has made in all competitions for Mauricio Pochettino's team.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/draxler-unhappiness-psg-situation-is-not-easy/blta441e8394309e995,By Peter McVitie,75bcd18c-272c-40c3-8bf9-42cbdc0fe7cb
'Selling Naby is not possible' - Klopp insists Keita will not leave Liverpool before transfer window closes,"Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool will not sell Naby Keita before the transfer window closes, despite reports suggesting the Guinea midfielder is unsettled at Anfield. Keita is into the final 12 months of his Reds contract, and while the club still hope to agree an extension with the 27-year-old, there have been claims in Germany that the player has become disillusioned with his situation. GOAL reported last week that Liverpool had no intention of selling, despite interest from clubs including RB Leipzig, and that stance has since been confirmed by Klopp. Speaking to reporters ahead of Liverpool‚Äôs trip to Manchester United on Monday night, Klopp said: ‚ÄúSelling Naby now and not replacing him? No, that is not possible.¬† ‚ÄúBut it is not the plan. We are done. Players go and we don‚Äôt replace him? No.¬† ‚ÄúNaby will not go but if he would, which he will not do, there would be a replacement.‚Äù Liverpool‚Äôs start to the new Premier League season has been a difficult one, with two underwhelming draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace, a red card for new signing Darwin Nunez and an injury list which will deny Klopp the services of players such as Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konate, Joel Matip and Curtis Jones at Old Trafford. Their struggles, relatively speaking, have strengthened calls for them to dip into the transfer market, but Klopp has consistently rejected that idea, insisting that he is happy with what he has, and that the situation will ease in the coming weeks. Asked about this ahead of the United game, he repeated that assertion: ‚ÄúYes [I am happy] when they are all fit, 100 percent.¬† ‚ÄúEven then we always look to strengthen but we always said that it must be the right player, and if the right player is not available then we deal with what we have rather than sign the wrong player.¬† ‚ÄúThis situation did not change. Now we have more injuries and it would be cool to have another midfielder.¬† ‚ÄúThere is also the situation that I am not in charge of what we spend. That is always the same, and didn‚Äôt change. You could say that is why we are here in a good understanding and a bad understanding.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI always have to accept and always did. That is it. It makes no sense to worry about something you cannot change. That is a waste of energy, a waste of positivity.¬† ‚ÄúI love this group and not because they are so good looking, no, because they are incredible characters and they showed it again on Monday. If the facts are the facts [then] accept them and go from there.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/selling-naby-not-possible-klopp-keita-will-not-leave/bltba42f9800bacad90,Neil Jones,b82e47b3-be81-469a-a7b6-29697bb41c62
Chelsea-supporting billionaires Candy and Reuben to submit separate takeover bids to buy club from Abramovich,"Two Chelsea-supporting billionaires have emerged as potential buyers of the club from Roman Abramovich, with Jamie Reuben and Nick Candy preparing separate offers.  Candy is working with a group of American investors on a bid of up to ¬£2.5 billion ($3.3bn), which is close to the Russian oligarch's asking price.  Candy would be keen to rebuild Stamford Bridge, too, with Abramovich's plans to do the same having been scrapped following the UK Government's withdrawal of his visa in 2018.  On the subject of an improved stadium, a spokesperson for Candy told the Telegraph: ""[Mr Candy is] actively exploring a number of options. ""The club deserves a world-class stadium ‚Äì and Mr Candy's unique expertise and background in real estate would be a hugely valuable asset to delivering this vision."" Candy himself added that he has spoken to ""most of the parties"" about the possibility of tabling a formal bid and said ""we are looking at what the art of the possible is."" Reuben owns roughly 10 per cent of Newcastle in conjunction with several other parties, including the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, having bought the club for ¬£300m ($400m) just last year He has been linked with a bid for Chelsea, who he grew up supporting,¬†by business media outlet Bloomberg, but sources close to him have since played down their interest.¬† That's because he would likely have to forgo his stake in the Magpies if successful.  There are a host of American billionaires who have been linked with bids for Chelsea, including Chicago Cubs chairman Thomas Ricketts, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson and Crystal Palace shareholder Josh Harris. As revealed first by GOAL, Saudi Media have contacted Raine Group - who are running the sale on behalf of Abramovich - about their desire to buy the club.  One disadvantage of their proposal is that ""politically sensitive parties"" have been discouraged from making an approach. Furthermore, there's the Swiss-American duo of Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly, who are negotiating their price with Abramovich's merchant bank representatives at Raine Group.  Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish billionaire, has been talking up his efforts to buy Chelsea, but he is unwilling to come close to Abramovich's asking price.  ‚ÄúWe have reached a certain stage,"" Bayrak told Oda TV. ""Our law and finance department will start talks with theirs in London on Thursday.  ""That‚Äôs the way it is at this point. On Thursday, we will notify the Public Disclosure Platform (KAP). People are talking about it, we made some progress in the talks, and the world believes we have a 90% chance of completing the deal.  ""Abramovich thinks the same. We didn‚Äôt give that price (¬£2.5bn) to the British press. Our offer is under that, I‚Äôll at least say that.‚Äù Although Abramovich remains keen to get a deal to sell Chelsea done, there are concerns that it could take some time to complete a transaction of this size.¬† There is thought to be a soft deadline of Wednesday, March 9¬†for provisional bids, with Abramovich initially targeting closing a deal by March 15. However, there are fears that time scale might be over-ambitious. The Russian oligarch is being pushed out of his ownership of Chelsea amid fears of potential sanctions from the United States, European Union (EU), or the United¬†Kingdom.¬† Any sanctions would stop him from either investing in or selling Chelsea after Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed his standing within western countries.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-supporting-billionaires-candy-reuben-separate/blt8bf04d3774bf4fa7,Nizaar Kinsella,157696a5-9d4d-4f31-b886-f84a042f55bf

Real Madrid accused of 'dangerous environment' for women's players,"Real Madrid Femenino have been accused of fostering a ""dangerous environment"" for players by outgoing forward Kosovare Asllani, who alleges the club pushes their squad members to play with injuries. The Sweden international first arrived at Las Blancas in 2019, and was their player of the season across the 2020-21 campaign. But reflecting on her time there as she prepares to depart as a free agent, she has now blasted Madrid's attitude towards their players, suggesting that they have been forced beyond their reasonable limits. ""I think there is a culture at the club which is unhealthy for players to be in,"" Asllani stated at a press conference. ""I have almost been forced to play injured. ""The management team has not listened to the medical team. It has become a very unhealthy and dangerous environment. I have done a lot for the club from the beginning and I have seen that the club has not treated players well over the years ""I think it's important for me to talk, since no-one else has. I have tried to make changes, but in the end, the environment created there is one of refusing to listen to the medical team and the players."" Previous reports had suggested that all was not well at the club, with previous coach David Aznar criticised for his training style before he was replaced by Alberto Toril last November. Asllani however felt that there was not enough of a change to sway her to remain, adding: ""It is no coincidence that I was injured there and had a setback, as you are constantly pushed to play injured. It is not a healthy environment. ""I care so much about the club, but I feel that it is in the wrong hands. I might have left last summer, but I gave it one last chance. I've been a big part of the club's history, but unfortunately it's an environment that is not healthy, and it's not just me.

Manchester City training Ukrainian refugee footballer who fled Moscow following Russian invasion,"Manchester City are helping to train a Ukrainian refugee footballer who fled Moscow following the Russian invasion of his homeland.  Andrii Kravchuk, who is a former youth team-mate of City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko, was playing for Torpedo Moscow in the Russian second tier when his homeland was invaded.  The 23-year-old has been offered the chance to train with the club‚Äôs elite development squad to maintain his form and fitness after his contract was terminated.  Kravchuk was on a pre-season training camp in Turkey when he received a call at 5am from his mother that Russia had started bombing Ukraine.  His family have remained in the capital Kyiv, with his brother fighting alongside his country‚Äôs armed forces.  He fled to Manchester and has been allowed to train with City following approval from the UK government, the Football Association and the Premier League.  The former Ukraine under-17 and under-21 international took part in his first training session at City‚Äôs Etihad Campus on Thursday.  ‚ÄúI am so grateful to Manchester City for giving me this chance to train with them,‚Äù he said.

Kravchuk first met the Ukraine captain when they were aged 11 and 13 at Shakhtar Donetsk‚Äôs youth academy more than a decade ago.  ‚ÄúWhile I wish the circumstances were very different, it has been good to be back with Andrii,‚Äù Zinchenko said.  ‚ÄúI know how much football means to him, and how it can help us during these difficult times. I would like to thank my club for giving him the opportunity to train with us.‚Äù  Zinchenko, who has been given warm support across football, has spoken about how he has struggled to comprehend the invasion and how he wishes he was able to return to his country to aid in the fight.

‚ÄòI admire Putellas and Morgan‚Äô - Colombia‚Äôs NXGN star Linda Caicedo on Barca rumours and professional dreams,"Colombia‚Äôs teenage sensation Linda Caicedo has dismissed rumours of an impending transfer to European champions Barcelona, but admits she is ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù a fan of the club. Caicedo finished No 13 this year in GOAL‚Äôs NXGN list, which ranks the best young players in the world. She also made the list in 2020 after top-scoring in Colombia's highest division to fire America de Cali to a first-ever Championship title. When she made the switch to Deportivo Cali, there was talk of it being a transfer that would pave the way to Barcelona further down the line - but the 17-year-old says that is not the case. In an exclusive interview with GOAL, Caicedo said: ‚ÄúI really like Paris [Saint-Germain], Barcelona. I'm a Barca fan here secretly! I think it's just waiting for the moment. ""I don't really choose a team - wherever God gives me to arrive and enjoy it, but right now I don't think like, ‚ÄòAh, I want to get to this team‚Äô. No, I want things to happen for me and where I can take advantage of my talent. ‚ÄúI think that every player wants to be a professional, wants to go abroad - obviously everything is in due time. Right now, I am focused on Deportivo Cali and the national team, so when the time comes for me to go abroad, I'm going to take advantage of it no matter what team and enjoy the game, not stress. ‚ÄúThat's what soccer is all about, it's fun and that's what I always try to do in training and in soccer matches.‚Äù Asked about the feeling of her inclusion in this year‚Äôs NXGN list, Caicedo added: ""The truth is that I am very happy. For me, all of this is very important, to see how what I have been doing bears fruit and results. ""I always try to show, I thought it was something both individual and collective, so I also take the opportunity to thank them for taking me into account and I hope to continue winning more. ""Those around me know how well I work and how hard I strive every day. It's just a way to improve, obviously. I've had a good year, just like last year, so I'm very happy and they always want me to improve, to win first, but it's about improving and growing day-by-day."" While right now Barcelona may not be the next destination of Caicedo, it is where one of her favourite players, Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, is making a real impact. Talking about the players she idolises, the top scorer in last season‚Äôs Copa Libertadores said: ‚ÄúThe truth is that Alexia has some excellent games, good numbers, she is an excellent player and I admire her as well as Alex Morgan. ‚ÄúMoving onto the men's side, I really like [Lionel] Messi, Cristiano [Ronaldo], [Kylian] Mbappe, Neymar. They are players that you see from a young age and I've always wanted to be like them. ‚ÄúI want to continue like this to improve and to be able to ratify myself a little more and then, continue to enjoy myself.‚Äù As for how she would like people to talk about her in a few years‚Äô time, Caicedo said: ‚ÄúAs a happy girl, someone who has always wanted to get ahead, who enjoys soccer, who has fun, who always feels it. ‚ÄúI still have a long way to go. I am only 17 years old. In the national team I have not won anything yet. I do not have a historical record, so I want to improve in that: 'Linda did the best in many things and she took advantage of it‚Äô' ‚ÄúI am very young and I have a lot of tournaments ahead of me, so that's what I am doing. I am believing and I hope people will know me for that, for my joy, for the way I lived soccer and that's how I always want to be known everywhere.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/putellas-morgan-colombia-nxgn-linda-caicedo-barcelona/bltc01083e2f9452414,Juan David Londo√±o and Juan Moncada Rico,8e8c1314-64a0-4026-968d-e67109345736

West Ham's Yarmolenko says he 'couldn't even talk' after Russia's invasion of Ukraine & was going 'crazy' while on compassionate leave,"West Ham's Andriy Yarmolenko has revealed that he ""couldn't even talk"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and went ""crazy"" while on compassionate leave. Yarmolenko, who has won over 100 caps for Ukraine at international level, was granted time off by West Ham after Russian troops began occupying regions of his homeland in February. The 32-year-old's wife and children were in Ukraine at the start of the conflict but have since returned to England after fleeing via Poland, while the Hammers have welcomed a popular figure back into the fold quicker than expected. David Moyes confirmed Yarmolenko's return for a clash with Aston Villa on March 13, and he marked the occasion by scoring, sparking emotional scenes at the London Stadium. The winger was mobbed by his team-mates after finding the net again in a subsequent Europa League clash with Sevilla, and he says his club commitments have come as a welcome distraction from the events in Ukraine. Yarmolenko struggled mentally during his brief time away from West Ham, as he said on Ukrainian YouTube channel Football 1/2/3: ""David Moyes told me I could choose to train or not and that I had to do everything I could to ensure the safety of my family. ""I needed to remain professional so I returned. I was just going crazy and you need to be distracted. But even now, I don‚Äôt know what the other results are. It is just training ends and then the phone calls home. ""It is honestly scary to talk about it. We have to help each other. If we do not then no one will. ""I am sure we will not be beaten by any country. No one will ever be able to break our spirit."" Yarmolenko went on to reveal that he was consumed by guilt and worry that left him unable to focus in training after seeing his family's arrival in Ukraine coincide with the start of Russia's invasion. ""When it all started, on February 24, I arrived at training and couldn‚Äôt even talk,"" he said. ""I had tears flowing. I asked the coach to let me go home. ""I didn‚Äôt believe this could happen. I sent my family to Kyiv because my child had to have a doctor‚Äôs appointment. ""Can you imagine what I was like when it started the next morning? I just wanted to run and hit my head against a wall. What a fool I was sending my family to Kyiv and I am sitting in London."" The West Ham star added on how the rest of his family are coping amid the war in Ukraine: ""All the relatives are alive and well. My cousins help keep in touch with uncles, aunts.  ""The ones there, where there is constant shelling going on, they are in bomb shelters, hiding in basements.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/west-ham-yarmolenko-russia-invasion-ukraine-crazy/blt74467b283f191302,James Westwood,b84fc1fe-22b4-41ee-bcb6-781abf9a1d10
Afcon 2021: Mane counting on Senegal‚Äôs experience for final showdown,"Senegal star Sadio Mane believes their experience will help them in their quest to win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations title on Sunday. Aliou Cisse‚Äôs men advanced into the final of the biennial showpiece for the second time in a row after beating Burkina Faso 3-1 in Wednesday‚Äôs semi-final fixture. Mane‚Äôs contribution of a goal and an assist got the job done at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium after a goalless first 45 minutes. In 2019, Senegal suffered a 1-0 loss in Cairo as they narrowly lost the continental crown to Algeria but Mane, who was part of that team too, said they are charged to end the country‚Äôs long wait for their first Afcon glory. ""Experience is a good asset,"" Mane said, as per Reuters. ""I think that has always been the case since the start of this tournament. We suffered so much with a lot of Covid cases and several injuries too. ""We had a very difficult time but with our experience we kept calm until we recovered the whole group. ""We played a final last time, so we have experience and we will try to win this trophy.‚Äù Senegal were also finalists at the 2002 edition in Mali when they lost to Cameroon via a penalty shoot-out after a goalless draw.

'A top 10 life moment' - Ryan Reynolds loves incredible 30-yard chip from Mullin as Wrexham reach Wembley cup final,"Hollywood star and Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds experienced a ""top 10 life moment"" when he saw his side secure a place in the FA Trophy final. The actor was stunned by an incredible lob from outside the box by Wrexham star Paul Mullin which gave the Welsh team the lead in the semi-final against Stockport on Saturday. Mullin struck twice in stoppage time in the second half to send the National League team through to the final at Wembley, and Reynolds made him go viral by sharing his opener on Twitter. Seeing this in person was a top ten life moment for me.

""But at the weekend, that goal's gone viral and Ryan's putting it everywhere. ""My phone's not stopped doing backflips and I've had to put it on sleep mode to get some sleep. ""But it's surreal sometimes the type of attention that the Hollywood superstars bring to the club and the area, highlighting a lot of things in Wales and Wrexham. ""It's good to see and all the fans are on a high at the moment."" He added: ""He said he'd never experienced anything like it and I often say to him that football gives you every emotion and it's impossible to describe how it makes you feel. ""I think Saturday gave him the feelings that he probably hadn't experienced before in life."" Wrexham will meet National League team Bromley in the FA Trophy final at Wembley on May 22, and Reynolds says he will be there to see his side on the big stage. He told BBC Sport: ""I got in at eight this morning, seven this morning, and I'll be home by eight, 10 tonight, to New York. It's a bit of a commute but, man, was that worth it. I'll take anything, that was really exciting.""  ""Oh, I wouldn't miss [the final]. Are you kidding me?

'I can improve everything' - Haaland warns he has not reached full potential ahead of Premier League debut,"Erling Haaland is not concerned about the idea of settling into the Premier League, and feels he can improve every single aspect of his game at Manchester City.   Man City lost 3-1 to Liverpool in the 2022 Community Shield and Haaland failed to score in a performance that saw him spurn key chances, including an opportunity from a seemingly unmissable range during the defeat. The 22-year-old completed a ¬£51.1 million move to City from Borussia Dortmund this summer and is expected to add a prolific edge to their front line, but feels he has not yet reached his full potential. Despite arriving with such a rampant scoring record having bagged 86 goals in 89 games for Dortmund, Haaland believes he can become even better. He told Sky Sports: ""I can improve everything. If you think I'm good at one thing, I can always get better."" He went further, relishing the chance to play under Pep Guardiola and insisting that improving is something he has to do. Haaland said: ""Part of the game is to get out of your comfort zone which is something I've been doing and something I like because then you develop more as a human being as well."" Haaland acknowledged the idea of a settling-in period, but is not overly vexed by the idea of a slow start. He said: ""We will see about settling in. People can take time, people can come directly into it. We have to see, but I'm not concerned."" He added: ""That's life as a footballer - you have to live with it. For me as a striker, this is something that I cannot stress about because if you think too much, you might end up doing things you don't want to do.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-premier-league-community-shield/blt02a45df5ef6c675b,Mitchell Wilks,a56526d6-946e-449c-a2df-60db8b4956a1
"Eintracht Frankfurt vs Bayern Munich: Predictions, tips, betting odds & UK TV channel","Bayern Munich are hoping for a strong start to the post-Robert Lewandowski era as they open the new season with a game against Eintracht Frankfurt. Julian Nagelsmann's team are looking to defend their Bundesliga title and make it 11 straight successful seasons in Germany. Eintracht Frankfurt, meanwhile, finished a disappointing 11th last term and can make a statement of intent with a positive display against the reigning champions. Bayern are the big favourites to claim three points with bet365 pricing them to win at 9/20 (1.45).

Bayern's new attacker Sadio Mane is the favourite to get the game's first goal at 4/1 (5.0) while team-mate Serge Gnabry is priced at 5/1 (6.0) to strike first. Santos Borre is 9/1 (10.0) to get the opening goal, while co-star Randal Muani is available at 10/1 (11.0). Bayern have gone through many changes during the summer transfer window. Out went star striker Robert Lewandowski and in came the likes of Sadio Mane, Matthijs de Ligt, Ryan Gravenberch, Noussair Mazraoui and young striker Mathys Tel. Eintracht Frankfurt hope to enjoy a much better season than the 2021-22 campaign.  They have strengthened over the courses of the transfer window with Jens Petter Hauge, Lucas Alario, Kristijan Jakic, Hrvoje Smolcic and World Cup-winner Mario Gotze coming in.

McKennie tips Pulisic to bounce back as USMNT star opens up on his own difficult moment,"Weston McKennie says that the entire U.S. men's national team is ready to support Christian Pulisic as he looks to find his form as the Juventus midfielder opened up on his own low moment earlier in qualifying. Pulisic came to USMNT camp for World Cup qualifiers amid a difficult moment at Chelsea as he battles to earn more playing time in Thomas Tuchel's attack. And McKennie, who relied on the support of his team-mates after being dismissed by the team in the fall for a rules violation, says that the group knows how to stick together and support each other during the frustrating times. Pulisic joined up with the USMNT at a tough moment as he has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge. The winger hasn't played as much as he would like and, when he has, he's been deployed either centrally or in an unfamiliar wingback role. Pulisic has struggled in each of the USMNT's first two games of the window, which has seen the team defeat El Salvador 1-0 before falling to Canada 2-0 on Sunday. ""A lot of people will say what they want, a lot of people have their own opinions and I think, as a player, you can only truly understand what another player might think or what he's going through,"" he said. ""All of us have had our ups and downs, all of us have had difficult times, and the most important thing is that we're there for each other and obviously, with the situation that he's in, maybe the amount of playing time that's involved, it's just catching his footing again and building his confidence. ""I think, in general, he is still an important piece because he's one of those types of players that might have one spark in a game, he could maybe not do anything all game, and then have one spark. He's one of the players that are very unpredictable to the opponents and I think he's just someone that adds another type of dangerous and one-on-one ability in the final third. ""Everyone's gonna have their opinions. Everyone's gonna say what they want to say, but the team here and the staff we all have his back and we all just want to put him in the best position to succeed."" McKennie went on to reflect on his lowest point as he opened up on being dismissed from USMNT camp last fall. The Juventus midfielder was sent home for violating protocol, but has since used that moment as a turning point for club and country. He has played his way into being an irreplaceable presence with Juventus while being one of the USMNT's brightest performers in the games since he was dismissed. ""I think it was just a learning lesson,"" he said. ""I think as I went back, it was just important for me to put my head down and work and Juventus definitely helped me out with that a lot. I struggled for a bit, lost my confidence and, like I said it was a learning lesson.  ""I felt like let my team down and let my country down and my family and myself, so whenever I got called back, I was just going to try and rebuild the relationships and the trust with everyone and just perform and show that I'm there for the team and  I'm there to try and win.  ""I think the best thing as a person to do is to be available. I think that was my biggest thing: just to be available and not have a situation like that again.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mckennie-tips-pulisic-to-bounce-back-as-usmnt-star-opens-up/bltf9286a867f5ccfda,Ryan Tolmich,88e3f433-256b-43b7-a3cc-f1bf73b79222
"'It's a real achievement to spend ¬£1 billion and be this bad!' - Man Utd played like 'U9s' in Brentford mauling, says horrified Neville","A horrified Gary Neville lambasted the Manchester United squad after their mauling at the hands of Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday. The Red Devils were simply no match for Thomas Franks's men, who completed a 4-0 rout within 40 minutes of the match thanks to goals from Josh Dasilva, Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee and Bryan Mbeumo. The result leaves United sitting at rock bottom of the table for the first time in 30 years, and a former captain was scathing in his assessment of their latest performance. Neville said it was like watching ""men against U9s"" and described their first-half showing as the worst he'd ever seen as a United supporter. ""If you thought it couldn't get any lower, it just has,"" he told SkySports. ""I'm trying to think of one thing Manchester United have done well in the first half and I can't think of one. I've been watching United for 42 years and I can't think of a moment where I've felt it was as bad as it was in that first half."" The Red Devils have now lost their last seven games on the road, with Neville adding on a miserable run: ""If you want to look for tell-tale signs that a team lacks personality and character, it's away performances, how you deal with set pieces, it's your running stats - Manchester United are miserable in all those areas."" Neville also appeared to call out the Glazer family, United's current owners, for failing to back new head coach Erik ten Hag in the transfer market. Christian Eriksen, Lisandro Martinez and Tyrell Malacia have been the only new faces at Old Trafford so far this summer, while a long-winded pursuit of Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong is still showing little sign of bearing fruit. ""Manchester United have known for eight to ten months they've needed to rebuild the squad for the summer. Ralf Rangnick [last season's interim manager] described it as open heart surgery,"" said Neville. ""To not get the players in early - the quality of players, the number of players - that Ten Hag needed is baffling and difficult to forgive. It's not a stalled market - teams have got their business done. Every club seems to have a plan and Manchester United's seems to be, 'let's just look at the Dutch league or players that have worked under Ten Hag'. ""That is not a strategy - you can't do that. That was 15 years ago. You've got to have players identified and the work's been done with the agents.  ""Yes, of course, you always try to please the manager if he has got a player he's got really good contacts with. But the one he has got good contacts with, they can't get in - Frenkie de Jong."" Pressed on the ant-Glazer protests from United supporters in the away end, Neville replied: ""The only decent thing about United is the fans and they've had enough."" The ex-United defender also questioned how the club have spent their money since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013 after seeing Brentford exploit their many weaknesses across the pitch. ""It's a real achievement to spend a billion pounds and be this bad. It doesn't take much to dismantle this Manchester United team,"" Neville said. ""It just takes a bit of organisation, a bit of fight, and you're there. If you just rough them up a little bit and get a goal, they're flaky like you wouldn't believe.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-achievement-spend-gbp1-billion-and-be-this-bad-man-utd-like-/blt114ab45caa740d01,Ritabrata Banerjee,a98d5052-cc93-491c-a4bd-bf2fc5b9b965
Bayern Munich's Hoeness on potential Gnabry transfer: Do you want me to shove money down his throat until he chokes?!,"Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness claims Serge Gnabry has received a ""great"" offer to extend his contract, but says the club cannot stuff him full of money until he agrees to sign. The Germany international has been linked with a move away from the Bundesliga champions as his current deal expires at the end of next season. Bayern have offered him an improved contract, but the club fear they could lose him in the near future. Hoeness believes there is little more the club can do to convince Gnabry to stay and must leave it up to the player to decide if he wants to follow the example set by Niklas Sule and David Alaba, who let their contracts expire. ""It's the same situation as with Sule. I think he has a great offer from Bayern and now has to make a decision,"" he told RTL when asked about Gnabry's situation.¬† ""Your media drives me crazy with these free transfer things. What do you want to do? Should you stuff the players with money until they say yes or maybe choke on it?"" GOAL reported in April that Gnabry is considering making a move away from the Bavarian side. Real Madrid and Liverpool are among the teams interested in signing the 26-year-old winger. Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn revealed that talks over a new deal have begun, but admitted that the ex-Arsenal and Hoffenheim player is in a ""process of reflection"" as he considers his options. Gnabry featured 45 times in all competitions for Bayern this season, scoring 17 times to help them win the Bundesliga and reach the last-16 of the Champions League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-s-hoeness-on-potential-gnabry-transfer-do-you-want-/bltce9232f29b46f8d6,Peter McVitie,67e0c0f3-7026-484a-b5bf-9a110931fdce
USMNT prospect Slonina completes ¬£12.3m Chelsea transfer from MLS side Chicago Fire,"Chelsea have completed the signing of Gabriel Slonina from the Chicago Fire, with the highly-rated teenager who has enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence in MLS being lined up as a possible future starting goalkeeper for Premier League heavyweights. At just 18, Slonina is being acquired by the Blues as part of a long-term recruitment plan that sees them building towards success at Stamford Bridge over a number of years. Slonina will form part of that process, with his career path seemingly set to take him to the very top of the game. Chelsea will pay up to ¬£12.3 million ($15m) to sign Slonina if all add-ons are met, with that deal representing a new record for an American goalkeeper. The youngster will be joining a number of compatriots in England once he officially joins the ranks in west London, with USMNT custodians Matt Turner, Zack Steffen and Ethan Horvath already tied to Premier League sides Arsenal, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest respectively. The likes of Brenden Aaronson, Tyler Adams and Chris Richards have also completed moves to the English top-flight this summer ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Chelsea have fended off rival interest from the likes of Real Madrid and Wolves to bring in Slonina. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very proud and happy to see Gaga reach this milestone moment in his career,‚Äù said Chicago Fire FC sporting director Georg Heitz in a statement. ‚ÄúSince joining the club, Gaga has embodied what it means to be a Chicago Fire player. In addition to his incredible talent, he is mature beyond his years, extremely hard working and a fantastic teammate.  ""Gaga is a role model to many young aspiring footballers in Chicago, and this transfer demonstrates that a player can progress to the first team from our academy before joining one of the biggest clubs in the world.‚Äù   Slonina has penned a six-year contract with the Blues, with his signing keeping one eye very much on the future. He will not link up with Chelsea until January 2023 as the deal taking him to England includes a loan agreement that will keep him in the United States for the remainder of the current MLS campaign. Gabriel Slonina has completed a permanent transfer to Chelsea! ‚úçÔ∏èThe 18-year-old joins from Chicago Fire where he will return on loan to complete their season before moving to London at the start of 2023. Slonina only made his professional debut in August 2021, becoming the youngest MLS starting goalkeeper in the process. He has been a regular ever since, allowing admiring glances to be attracted from afar. There is an opportunity for him to head to west London with another piece of history under his belt, with Slonina currently in the process of trying to set a new MLS clean sheet record. He has 10 shutouts to his name so far, with seven more required from 11 games in order to raise a bar of individual brilliance between the sticks. Chelsea have now spent over ¬£100m ($122m) in the summer transfer window, with big-money deals already completed for Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly. There is the promise of more movement in and out before the next deadline passes, with the likes of Cesar Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Hakim Ziyech and Armando Broja being linked with moves elsewhere. Spain international keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is said to be close to joining Napoli, and the arrival of Slonina could clear a path for him to move on, as Edouard Mendy remains Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs favoured No.1. On the incomings front, the Blues continue to be linked with Paris Saint-Germain centre-half Presnel Kimpembe, while Leicester star Wesley Fofana has emerged as another defensive target. There has been talk of Inter right-back Denzel Dumfries being pursued if squad spots open up, with Allan Saint-Maximin and Endrick among the other exciting talents to have seen switches to Stamford Bridge speculated on.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-prospect-slonina-chelsea-transfer-mls-chicago-fire/bltbbf5e126cdf50de8,Chris Burton,e7fe35d2-27df-4a2d-a8c7-6dfe43979056

"Gabon sexual abuse cases: Fifa hand out suspensions, formal proceedings begin","Fifa's Independent Ethics Committee have suspended Patrick Assoumou Eyi, Serge Mombo, and two other football coaches as they begin investigations into alleged sexual abuse in Gabonese football. The individuals have been accused of raping, grooming and exploiting young players.  According to The Guardian, Eyi - who was the national U17 coach - has already admitted to committing the aforementioned crimes and is waiting to be sentenced. Mombo, who is heading Gabon's top tier, is also under investigation alongside Orphee Mickala of Tout Puissant Akwembe FC and Moussavou FC's Triphel Mabicka. Mombo allegedly sexually abused young players and demanded sex from players to secure places for them on the national team. The administrator has denied the claims. The suspects have been banned from all football-related activities for 90 days by the world football governing body. ""These sanctions have been imposed in connection with ongoing criminal investigations concerning the above-mentioned Gabonese football officials, who were identified as having allegedly been involved in acts of systematic sexual abuse against minor players, as reported by local authorities and published in certain media outlets,"" read part of the statement from Fifa. The Gabonese Football Federation President Pierre-Alain Mounguengui has also undergone pre-trial detention at the central prison in Libreville after being arrested in connection with the aforementioned crimes. Despite not being directly connected with the crimes, the 64-year-old might serve up to three years in jail if found guilty of not reporting the offenses against the minors. An initial statement from the international player's union, Fifpro, asked action to be taken to prevent sexual abuses from happening and urged the Gabon government to treat the case as 'a matter of urgency'. ""Our preliminary inquiries yielded consistent evidence from credible witnesses who all tell of an ongoing and long-embedded practice of forcing young players into sexual relationships as a pre-condition for footballing opportunities,"" Fifpro stated.  ""If these allegations are indeed true, it is yet further evidence that football is being consistently exploited, across leagues and continents, as a forum for abusers to access, groom, extort and assault players. More must be done to prevent this horrific abuse and we call on football‚Äôs governing bodies to act as a matter of urgency.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gabon-sexual-abuse-cases-fifa-hand-out-suspensions/blt2596bb113dfc8ae2,Seth Willis,a74ec7bf-25d5-409c-b886-08a7f2eadbc8
Adem Buyuk causes stir in Turkey as Yeni Malatyaspor player-coach subs himself on - but his team still loses,"Turkish football witnessed something a little different on Saturday as Yeni Malatyaspor's new player-coach subbed himself on for the first time since being appointed. Having been promoted to the dual role following Marius Sumudica's exit earlier in February, the forward introduced himself after 55 minutes against Antalyaspor in place of Mustafa Eskihellac. Despite the bold move, Malatyaspor lost the game 2-1. With the first half of the match having ended 1-0 to Antalyaspor, Buyuk made the decision to shake things up, bringing himself onto the pitch 10 minutes after the restart in search of an equaliser. The 34-year-old put in a decent performance, putting an effort just wide of the post, but Fernando doubled the visitors' lead shortly after Buyuk was introduced, meaning Raman Cagiran's late goal was a mere consolation. Interestingly, former Liverpool, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund star Nuri Sahin, now manager of Antalyaspor, was also amongst the substitutes for the match but remained in the dugout for the duration of the game. Buyuk took charge of his first match last week against Sivasspor, but remained on the bench in what ultimately ended up another 2-1 loss.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/adem-buyuk-turkey-yeni-malatyaspor-player-coach-subs-himself/bltf563db356f5a271a,Stephen Crawford,732502be-bda0-4995-b430-913c40a23659
Arsenal most expensive player sales - How Gunners made over ¬£685m in outgoing transfers,"During the early days of Arsene Wenger, Arsenal were known for cashing in on players for big profit, but nowadays they find things far more difficult. The Gunners‚Äô struggles to get big transfer fees has been the source of much frustration from fans, who have seen plenty of star names opt to run down their contracts and leave on a free transfer over the course of the past decade.

Van Dijk could have joined Crystal Palace for ¬£5m - but Liverpool star was turned down for being 'too slow',"Former Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has revealed that he had the chance to sign Virgil van Dijk for just ¬£5 million before his Southampton move - but passed up on the opportunity.  Van Dijk went on to shine at the Saints and then Liverpool, where he has blossomed into one of the world's best defenders.  But according to Warnock, concerns over the Dutchman's pace led him to turn the player down.  ""The one that got away from me was Virgil van Dijk,"" Warnock told the Mirror. ""I got offered him when I was at Crystal Palace for ¬£5 million. ""But my chief scout said he was too slow and he ended up at¬†Southampton¬†instead! It‚Äôs a shame because anything he may lack in pace, he makes up for 10-fold in his ability to read the game."" Warnock also passed judgement on Gareth Southgate's England team, who are reeling after going down to an historic 4-0 home defeat to Hungary in the UEFA Nations League.  ""I don't think there was anybody better than Gareth but the problem he's got is he's had so much success,"" he added.  ""When I first started in football an experienced manager Bob Murphy told me 'the problem with success is the fans always want more'. ""Gareth needs to get a few weeks off to recharge his batteries. These results mean at the beginning of the next camp people will be apprehensive. ""I don't think you can win as England manager. I think it's a horrible job. It's impossible to please everybody.

"Vancouver Whitecaps vs LAFC: Predictions, tips and betting odds","LAFC head to Vancouver Whitecaps in the early hours of Saturday morning aiming to extend their lead at the top of MLS' Western Conference. The California outfit are five points clear of their nearest rivals after a run of four wins and a draw from their last five matches, but face a Whitecaps side who have lost just one of their last 13 home clashes. GOAL has all the latest odds and the best betting tips. Vancouver's only home league defeat in the last 10 months came back in April yet the hosts are clear outsiders at 5/2 (3.50) with bet365. LAFC for their part are offered at evens (2.00) to claim their fifth road win of the season with the draw available at 5/2 (3.50). Danny Musovski opened the scoring in LAFC's midweek 3-1 home win against FC Dallas and the USA international is priced at 6/1 (7.00) to break the deadlock once more. Carlos Vela is the shortest priced player to score first at 4/1 (5.00) with Cristian Arango at 9/2 (5.50). For the hosts, top scorer Lucas Cavallini is the favourite to score first at 6/1 (7.00) with fellow forward Brian White priced at 15/2 (8.50). Over the years this has been a highly entertaining fixture with both teams to score paying out in each of the last five meetings. Vancouver also have a strong home record against the side from Los Angeles winning each of their last three games, and with Vanni Sartini's men in such strong form in front of their own fans, another competitive showing from the Canadians should be expected. The visitors have kept just one clean sheet in their last six away games and have not been as impressive on the road as they have been at the Banc of California stadium. Opposing an away win therefore should be of interest. The Whitecaps are priced at 4/5 (1.80) to win with a +0.5 Asian handicap, which pays out if they avoid defeat, something they have managed in 18 of their last 20 home league games. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

"Nottingham Forest hint at transfers and promotion is Steve Cooper's 'miracle', says owner's son","Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis' son Miltiadis has spoken about his family's ambitions for the club upon gaining promotion to the Premier League. The Greek billionaires were in attendance at Wembley as their club beat Huddersfield Town 1-0 after an own goal by Chelsea loanee Levi Colwill. Having long targeted promotion for the fallen giants since buying them in 2017, the Marinakis family can boast of having achieved their aims through the brilliant leadership of manager Steve Cooper. ""I feel incredible,"" Marinakis told GOAL. ""We brought in a manager after six defeats in the first eight games of the season. We were bottom of the league with only four points. ""It is beautiful because we got our first win against Huddersfield and now achieved this. I don‚Äôt know how to describe what I am feeling it is incredible.

It comes after Brentford had a late ¬£15 million ($19m) bid rejected in January for the homegrown Forest star, who was once targeted by Chelsea as an academy signing.

Gravenberch explains snub of ‚Äòbig and beautiful‚Äô Man Utd as he favours Bayern Munich over Ten Hag reunion,"Ryan Gravenberch has explained why he snubbed the opportunity to be reunited with former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag at ‚Äúbig and beautiful‚Äù Manchester United. The 20-year-old midfielder is preparing to complete a transfer to Bayern Munich after more than 100 competitive appearances in his homeland and 10 caps for his country. There had been suggestions he could take his potential to Old Trafford, alongside a manager he knows well, but Gravenberch says he quickly set his heart on German giants and was never going to make a U-turn and head for England. The Dutch star has told De Telegraaf: ‚ÄúManchester United is a very big and beautiful club, but I already had such a good feeling at Bayern and I had given my word. ‚ÄúMy choice was actually made pretty quickly.

Gravenberch added: ""In the end Ajax made me a royal offer, and if Bayern hadn't made such a good impression, I would certainly have signed. ‚ÄúI walked around there for 12 years and Ajax has made me the player I am today. I think it is logical that Ajax earns something from me, because the club has always been good to me. We part as good friends.

Everton fan admits throwing bottle at Aston Villa players during Premier League defeat,"An Everton fan has admitted to throwing a bottle at Aston Villa's players during the Toffee's 1-0 loss at Goodison Park on January 22. Roger Tweedle, 19, threw a plastic bottle at Villa players during a celebration of the game's lone goal, with the bottle hitting Matty Cash in the face.  Tweedle has admitted common assault and throwing a bottle towards the playing area. Prosecutor Amanda York said Tweedle was identified by police officers and removed from his seat shortly after the incident. The teenager was arrested and interviewed, admitting he was ""not very happy"" and that he ""went along with the crowd"" when Villa scored and celebrated in front of home supporters. York said Cash was not injured and did not need medical treatment, and the court was told that Tweedle said that he did not realise he had committed an offence when he was arrested and was remorseful for his actions. The Liverpool native was granted bail ahead of sentencing at Sefton Magistrates' Court on March 24.  Tweedle is not allowed to go within a mile of Goodison Park and is also barred from attending any regulated football matches. District Judge James Clarke adjourned proceedings for a pre-sentence report to find out more about Tweedle, who has no prior convictions.

"Pulisic, Pepi and the USMNT's winners and losers as World Cup qualification secured","It has been a four-year journey to this moment, and it is nearly here: the United States men's national team are officially going to the World Cup. They survived a gruelling CONCACAF World Cup qualifying campaign to get there, finishing third in the Octagonal to earn one of three automatic spots in Qatar this winter. Their qualifying journey ended Thursday with a 2-0 loss to Costa Rica but, in actuallity, it reached its peak on Sunday, as the U.S. all-but sealed their spot with an emphatic win over Panama. It was on that night that the USMNT made a statement, but it was not the only positive step taken over the last week. There was also the scoreless draw at the Azteca, a game that saw the U.S. go toe-to-toe with rivals Mexico at one of the fiercest stadiums in the game. Although the loss to Costa Rica was still a low, there was little that could dampen the mood. The U.S. are back on the global stage, and will now spend the next eight months building towards the next step of their journey But who shined brightest in the final round of qualifying? And which players needed to show more as competition heats up for spots in Qatar? GOAL is here to breakdown the winners and losers of the final round of World Cup qualifying: Captain American proved he is captain material. Pulisic was exactly the leader the USMNT needed against Panama, as his hat-trick capped what was one of his best performances in a national team shirt. He was lively and energetic, but it was also a performance filled with emotion and, most importantly, goals. Against Panama, the normally-stoic Pulisic showed a side of himself that we had not really seen, as he truly let his passion shine through. After spending years trying to shoulder too much of the load, Pulisic has learned that he plays his best when he does not put so much pressure on himself. And, with this team and with these players around him, he doesn't need to. After seven months and 14 qualifying games, we are still no closer to figuring out who will start for the USMNT in Qatar. For months, it appeared to be Ricardo Pepi, but the young Augsburg star was relatively quiet once again this week, and the teenager still has not scored for club or country since October. Jordan Pefok has scored lots of goals at club level in that time, but he did himself no favors this window. Teed up with a golden chance to win the game against Mexico, Pefok shanked his shot, leaving the USMNT to settle for a draw. It is harsh to judge a player off one missed chance, but that is the way the game works as a No.9. Jesus Ferreira, meanwhile, did impress in his start, scoring against Panama while showing a bit of CONCACAF understanding by distracting the opposition goalkeeper during both penalties. Ferreira is still very, very young and still playing his way into a regular role, but he is certainly one to watch over the next seven months in the race to be the No.9. From out of the picture to a key piece of the USMNT midfield, what a rise it has been for Luca de la Torre. The Heracles midfielder is the perfect example of how important it is to be in the right situation, as his time in the Eredivise his helped him take his game to the next level. Since returning to the USMNT earlier this year, De la Torre has been fantastic, offering Berhalter another legitimate option in the center of the field. When healthy, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams are still starters, and it will be tough for De la Torre to unseat them. However, he sure as hell has played his way into the rotation and, if all goes well, should be a part of the roster in Qatar. De la Torre is a player that can unsettle a defense, that can pick out a final ball and carry it when neccesary. That type of player is so valuable, and is why De la Torre is now so important having been nowhere near the team just a few months ago. Zack Steffen did himself few favors on Wednesday. The Manchester City goalkeeper was not totally to blame for Costa Rica's first goal, although he was a step slow during the sequence. But he surely will receive the blame for the second, which saw him fail to claim a cross as two set pieces proved the team's undoing. The USMNT goalkeeper competition, then, continues, even with Matt Turner sidelined this camp due to injury. Much will be determined by how, or how much, Turner and Steffen play at the start of next season in England. As things stand, Steffen still feels like he has a leg up, but even so, this is very much a competition and, with a chance to make another good impression, Steffen let it slip through his grasp. Okay, so this one may be a bit of a cop-out, but it is also important to talk about this all fits in the big picture. Despite qualifying ending on a bit of a low with the loss to Costa Rica, there is no real way to explain how valuable the last 12 months or so have been to American soccer. From the Nations League and Gold Cup to this World Cup qualification, the young core of the USMNT have been thrown into the CONCACAF fire and, although they were burned a few times, they emerged. That is the first positive step, especially considering what happened four years ago. Now, the U.S. is in position for that next positive step, which is one that should recapture the imaginations of the general public. After missing out in 2018, the USMNT sank into the background, becoming the butt of jokes from the casual observer. In Qatar this winter, they will be able to come back to the forefront; a team loaded with young, talented stars eager to prove themselves. The point is, this was a monumental step for American soccer, even if it was just the first one. Brighter days are ahead, and the U.S. earned the right to have those brighter days over the last 12 months.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pulisic-pepi-usmnt-winners-losers-world-cup-qualification/blt22ffb0f56b261de0,Ryan Tolmich,353577a4-96a3-44d4-b4b6-def75262d329

"Relegated Watford‚Äôs Dennis, Sarr remain sidelined for Leicester City Premier League clash","Nigeria international Emmanuel Dennis and his Senegal counterpart Ismaila Sarr will miss their second straight Premier League fixture when relegated Watford host Leicester City at Vicarage Road on Sunday. The two African players were not in action as the Hornets picked a 0-0 draw against Everton in their last league assignment at the same venue three days ago owing to injuries suffered during the 1-0 defeat against Crystal Palace on May 7 at Selhurst Park.

Watford have once again confirmed the absence of the two players for their final home top-flight fixture of the current campaign. ‚ÄúKiko [Femenia] and Joshua King are both still suffering from sickness, while Tom Cleverley [ribs], Emmanuel Dennis [knee], Shaq Forde [ankle], Cucho Hernandez [hamstring], Juraj Kucka [knee], Imran Louza [knee] and Ismaila Sarr [knee] all remain sidelined by injury,‚Äù the club confirmed on their official website while giving injury updates for the Leicester fixture. Watford have, however, confirmed the availability of Ivory Coast defender Hassane Kamara, who missed the game against Everton owing to suspension, the same for Cameroon defender, Nicolas Nkoulou, who has been struggling with a groin injury. ‚ÄúHassane [Kamara] is available having served a one-match suspension following his sending off at Crystal Palace, and Kwadwo Baah has returned from international duty with Germany U19s,‚Äù the statement continued. ‚ÄúNicolas Nkoulou [groin] has returned to training and could be available this weekend.‚Äù With the injuries presenting a challenge for Watford, manager Roy Hodgson has pledged to use the opportunity and trust the other talented players at his disposal to demonstrate their quality against the Foxes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy to give those boys that played against Everton another go,‚Äù the former England manager told the same portal. ‚ÄúIf anything, they deserve it. I‚Äôm not crying or bleating about the situation ‚Äì I‚Äôm actually quite looking forward to it.‚Äù The injury to Dennis, who has so far scored 10 Premier League goals from 33 matches, will also be a huge blow to the Super Eagles ahead of their upcoming friendly matches against Mexico and Ecuador and also their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in June. Dennis is among Nigeria‚Äôs Europe-based players already shortlisted in the provisional squad for the two friendly matches - the first against Mexico on May 29 at AT&T Stadium, and the second against Ecuador on June 3 at Red Bull Arena.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/relegated-watford-dennis-sarr-remain-sidelined-for-leicester/blt1b4afa943c85e29d,Dennis Mabuka,f8e50316-5a8b-431a-9918-1c97485f8cf4
"England Women's 2022 fixtures & results: World Cup qualifying group, Euros & Lionesses' match schedule in full","It came home. 2022 will forever be remembered as a defining year for England as the Lionesses won the Euros on home soil, defeating Germany in the final. The Lionesses had an eventful 2021, with three different people holding the role of head coach over the year, but ended the year in strong form under new boss Sarina Wiegman, scoring 53 goals and conceding none in her first six games. That good form continued on straight to the Euros, as Wiegman and England wrote their names into history with their Euros triumph. The Lionesses kicked off the year in February, with Spain, Germany and Canada all travelling to England for the Arnold Clark Cup. All four faced off in a round-robin tournament that began on February 17, with the winner crowned on February 23. It was indeed England that emerged victorious, after following up draws against Canada and Spain with a victory over Germany - only their second ever against a huge European rival. Spain also ended the tournament with two draws and a win, but the Lionesses topped the standings by virtue of goal difference. In April, Wiegman's team resumed its World Cup qualifying with a resounding 10-0 victory over North Macedonia, Beth Mead scoring four goals while Ella Toone netted her second senior international hat-trick. The team followed that up with another big win a few days later, beating Northern Ireland 5-0. In the build-up to the Euros, the Lionesses also won all three of their pre-tournament friendlies against Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland - the second result the most impressive, given the Dutch are the reigning European champions. They went on on to roll to the Euro 2022 final, where they took down Germany 2-1 in extra time. Just 34 days after that triumph, England then confirmed their place at the 2023 Women's World Cup by beating Austria 2-0, sealing the spot with a game to spare. In their final game, they maintained their perfect record in qualifying by beating Luxembourg. They then closed out the year with a series of friendlies, avoiding defeat in all to ensure Wiegman's unbeaten record as England coach remained in tact - with the win over the world champions, the United States, at Wembley a huge statement in particular going into next summer's World Cup. The Lionesses will next be in action in February 2023 when they host the second edition of the Arnold Clark Cup, a friendly tournament which they won last year in the build-up to the Euros. In April, as European champions, they then face Brazil in the first Women's Finalissima at Wembley, following the South American side's Copa America triumph, while their group stage fixtures for the Women's World Cup have also been confirmed.

"Are there more doors or wheels? Man City, Spurs, Philadelphia Union & football's stars ponder answer to viral question","Are there more doors or wheels? Football's brightest minds are on the case, with the stars of Premier League sides Manchester City and Tottenham, as well as MLS outfit Philadelphia Union searching for the right answer. Much like the blue and black dress phenomenon and 'Yanny or Laurel', it is a question that has threatened to break the internet, with everyone wondering if there is a greater number of doors or wheels in the world. So what do Jack Grealish, Harry Kane and other footballers think? GOAL brings you the details. In the absence of an itemised list of doors and wheels, it is practically impossible to know the answer to the question, but Kane is in no doubt that there are more doors. ""Doors, without question, think of all the cupboards,"" reflected the England and Spurs captain. ""I was going around my house yesterday, there were five times the amount of doors. It‚Äôs not even a debate for me.‚Äù Kane's partner-in-crime Heung-Min Son took a different position though: ""I‚Äôll say wheels, just think of one car - it has four wheels."" Let‚Äôs settle this‚Ä¶In the world, are there more doors or wheels? üßê pic.twitter.com/6JlNIh6ffn The debate also gripped the Manchester City training session this week, as Grealish posed the question to his team-mates, but the conundrum left Rodri flummoxed and he decided not to give an answer. Kyle Walker thought a more interesting question to ponder was: ""Are there more grains of sand on earth than there are stars?"" It's a good question. More doors or more wheels? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/hQIwCtBHc6 The question has crossed the Atlantic too, with Philadelphia Union players getting in on the debate.  The majority of the Union stars seem to come down on the side of wheels, with lego cars and model car toys being cited as an example of the proponderance of the circular objects. Team Wheels or Team Doors?!Please discuss loudly ‚¨áÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/ay28mpHTUC At Crystal Palace, Connor Gallagher, who is on loan at the club from Chelsea, reckoned that wheels won out, saying: ""Definitely wheels. Does a cupboard count as a door? I'm saying wheels still!"" However, the Eagles are a divided camp, with Nathaniel Clyne declaring: ""There‚Äôs more doors, everyone‚Äôs got a door, so I‚Äôll say more doors than wheels.""

'I didn't know I was famous in Ghana!' - Williams reveals inspiration behind nationality switch,"Athletic Club star Inaki Williams has revealed that his unexpecteed popularity in Ghana inspired his decision to switch allegiance from Spain to the African country.  Williams was among a number of foreign-born stars who confirmed their availability for the Blacks Stars this week.  Southampton‚Äôs Mohammed Salisu, Brighton star Tariq Lamptey, Stephan Ambrosius of Hamburg, Darmstadt defender Patric Pfeiffer and Ransford-Yeboah Konigsdorffer have all agreed to represent Ghana ahead of the 2022 World Cup.  Wiliams was born in Spain to Ghanaian parents, making him eligible to represent the nation after playing just one match for Spain. He paid a visit to Ghana with his brother recently and the adoration he received played a role in his subsequent choice. ""The people told me to play for Black Stars. They said: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre a striker, you‚Äôre the best,‚Äô"" he said. ""This was special for me because in Spain, I am famous but I did not know I was famous in Ghana. This was special and made the decision to switch easy. I am going to work hard 100 per cent to raise the Ghana flag. ""It was beautiful playing for Spain. I have lived in Spain all my life but I did not forget Ghana. Ghana is special to me because my family and parents are here, my blood is here, so I didn‚Äôt forget Ghana people. ""I came here and I saw all the people, all the people treated me well, called on me to come here and play here. I feel I am Ghanaian at heart and enjoy this country. ""My parents are Ghanaian and I did not forget that my parents moved from this country to Spain. I felt I needed to give Ghanaians something and that something is football."" Williams will be in with a chance of making the Ghana squad for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar this year. Ghana are in a tough group, as they will battle Portugal, South Korea and Uruguay for a place in the knockout staged.  However, the attacker believes his new national team can at least make it into the round of 16. ‚ÄúI am ready for the pressure that comes with playing for the Black Stars because it is part of football,"" he said.  ""I have played over 300 games in Bilbao and I have pressure every Sunday when I play because have to defend the shirt. ‚ÄúEleven against 11 anything can happen in football. It is a difficult group, but the team will do everything to qualify to the next round.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ghana-williams-reveals-inspiration-behind-nationality-switch/blt1e3b3807059ec793,Peter McVitie,f58afcc9-77ad-450d-b1e6-3309febee118
"Getafe vs Atletico Madrid: Predictions, tips & betting odds","Atletico Madrid travel to Getafe on Monday evening as Diego Simeone's men begin their La Liga campaign with a local derby. Los Rojiblancos started the previous season as defending champions but ended 15 points behind eventual winners Real Madrid and Atletico will be aiming for a much improved showing this year. Getafe meanwhile have been active in the transfer market and will be targeting a top-10 finish. The visitors are clear favourites to record a victory in their first game and are priced at 10/11 (1.91) by bet365. Atletico won both games against Getafe last season but needed injury time strikes in both matches to secure all three points. Los Azulones can be backed at 4/1 (5.00) to claim a win with the draw available at 2/1 (3.00). Alvaro Morata has impressed in pre-season after his return from a season long loan at Juventus at the Spain international striker is the favourite to break the deadlock at 4/1 (5.00). Joao Felix is likely to feature up front as well for the visitors and he can be backed at 5/1 (6.00) with Antoine Griezmann offered at 6/1 (7.00). The shortest priced player for the hosts is their top scorer from last term Enes Unal.  The Turkish striker scored 16 league strikes in the 2021/22 campaign and can be backed at 7/1 (8.00). Pre-season has seen Atletico Madrid play well and score plenty of goals, beating Cadiz 4-1 and Juventus 4-0. Morata scored four goals in those two games and with Joao Felix looking sharp as well, hopes are high that Los Rojiblancos can be effective in the final third this term. Getafe too are feeling positive heading into the new campaign after a summer transfer window which has seen them sign proven quality La Liga players in Borja Mayoral, Luis Milla, Portu and Domingos Duarte. Both of these sides are in better shape than they were last season and there could be value in backing another high scoring match between them. Both matches last term between the sides saw over 2.5 goals and a repeat is offered at the extremely generous looking price of 2/1 (3.00). You can watch La Liga live on the go with your iPhone, iPad or Android device through your bet365 account. All you need is a funded account or to have placed a bet in the last 24 hours to qualify.

Stefan Savic: From Man City's forgotten title-winner to Simeone's headbutting and hair-pulling henchman,"Stefan Savic had few friends at Manchester City long before his controversial performance for Atletico Madrid over their two-legged quarter-final battle in the Champions League. The difference between the shy, fresh-faced 20-year-old that arrived at the Etihad Stadium in 2011 and the snarling, intimidating leader of this week could, though, hardly be more different. There was the odd indication of the player that Savic would become during his time at City when he joined from Partizan Belgrade more than a decade ago, but nothing close to the intimidating henchman that now leads the Spanish champions. Signed with the reputation as a no-nonsense defender, the Montenegro international made an impression in his very first training session with City, when he launched into a scything tackle that took out then-manager Roberto Mancini, much to the enjoyment of his new City team-mates. But the reality is he was a different person from the defender that tried to bully Atletico past the Premier League champions on Wednesday at the Wanda Metripolitano. Hard as it is to believe, he was not yet physical enough to play in the Premier League and found it difficult acclimatising to life in England. With a hippy haircut, Savic looked more like a frontman for a Manchester rock band than the Hollywood baddie that he has morphed into. Away from the pitch, he was close friends with Serbian Aleksandar Kolarov and Bosnian Edin Dzeko, but largely struggled to make an impression around the first-team squad. ""It was a big step in my career. Looking back, I may not have been ready for the Premier League at the time, it was a very big jump,‚Äù he said after the two sides were paired together in Europe. City went onto win a dramatic title race in 2012 during Savic's time at the club, but he made just five starts in the Premier League and two in the Champions League during that campaign. Possibly his most memorable moment was being brutally substituted at half-time of a League Cup semi-final exit to Liverpool, when he looked utterly out of his depth in a chastening night at Anfield. Despite that, there were some inside the club that could see his potential, but he was sold shortly after to Italian club Fiorentina as Matija Nastasic - another ultimately underwhelming centre-back signing for City - coming the other way. That time in Serie A gave Savic time to grow, and when he finally joined Diego Simeone at Atletico, he found a manager that appreciated his art of defending. Alongside dark-arts masters like Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez, he has truly learnt his craft and has now taken on the role as the club's main defensive enforcer. That role is not just defined by defending brilliantly, but also in making it as hostile on the pitch as it is in the stands in the Spanish capital. ""From minute one he will be asking for yellow cards from the touchline and the players will be winding up others,"" his former Atleti team-mate Kieran Trippier had predicted ahead of the second leg. ""He wants players to get around the ref. Savic will be the big one tonight, he will be in Man City's faces."" Yet it was still surprising to see Savic lose his composure as Atleti tried to desperately force an equaliser in Wednesday's defeat. In the first leg, he had tried to distract the City players, teasing Jack Grealish's hair and trying to irritate Kevin De Bruyne. But in the second leg, that discipline was gone, as the masters of the dark arts were riled by a supposedly sophisticated side beating them at their own tactics. Savic tried to bully Phil Foden throughout, but failed. When the England international kept coming back for more, the Montenegrin lost it. After trying to drag Foden back off the pitch when the injured midfielder rolled over the touchline following a foul by Felipe, Savic went on to seemingly headbutt Raheem Sterling and yank substitute Grealish's hair once more. He was involved in more ugly scenes in the tunnel after the game, and UEFA will no doubt investigate exactly what happened after the referee's report arrives. Incredibly, the statisticians revealed that Savic did not commit a single foul during the 180 minutes of the tie, but it would be a surprise to see him escape any further punishment. Atleti and Simeone, though, will only love him more for the passion and commitment that he showed. And so while Savic does have a Premier League winner's medal from his time at City, it is a brief chapter in his illustrious career. When City have a squad reunion to mark the 10th anniversary of that remarkable and dramatic title later this year, Savic will not be there. Not because of any bad blood following the Champions League encounter. But because he was only a bit-part player at City.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/stefan-savic-man-city-forgotten-title-winner-headbutting/blt4d05f17af602e8dd,Jonathan Smith,92b20b36-37d8-46d1-a627-e60cbcb32e13
Ex-Arsenal star Wilshere joins Danish side Aarhus,"Jack Wilshere has joined Danish side Aarhus. The former Arsenal midfielder has signed a contract that runs until the end of the season but includes an option to extend the deal. Wilshere has not played a competitive match since May 2021, when he enjoyed a short spell at Championship side Bournemouth. ""Since I started training with Arsenal, I have never hidden that it was to be ready for 2022 and for a new club,"" Wilshere told the club's website.¬† Vi er glade for at kunne byde @JackWilshere velkommen til AGF og til #aarhus ü§ù‚öΩ‚¨á #ksdh #sldk ""It has now succeeded and it will be an exciting new challenge for me.¬†I am at a point in my career where I need to get started again after a difficult period, and that opportunity AGF has offered me.¬† ""I am very grateful for that and I will do everything I can to help the team move forward. ""I have been looking for a change of air and a fresh start in a new framework, and I am very much looking forward to contributing to the team.¬† ""It's clear that I lack a bit of training, but I'm physically in really good shape and fit, so now it's about me to get well into the squad and see if I can earn playing time for the club and contribute to , that we can get some points on the account."" ""Jack needs no further presentation, and he has shown his worth on both club and national teams over the past 10 years,"" said Stig Inge Bjornebye.  ""So when the opportunity arose to get him here to Aarhus, we had no doubt that we would like to pursue it. Jack can contribute with his excellent technique and his gaze for the game and he will give us some extra offensive tools.  ""He is in good physical shape, but of course lacks some combat training. It will probably come, and we look forward to seeing him in the white jersey when he has fallen well into place."" Wilshere rose to prominence in the Arsenal squad following his journey through the Arsenal youth academy. He made his debut for the Gunners in 2008, but his playing time was cut short because of injuries. The England international made almost 200 appearances for the club in all competitions. He was sent on loan to Bournemouth in 2016 for one year before making the permanent switch to West Ham on a free transfer two years later. Following his release from the east London club, he returned to Bournemouth for a short spell but left last summer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-arsenal-star-wilshere-joins-danish-side-aarhus/blt8198a224a65fc863,By Peter McVitie,ce905587-91e9-44e9-83c8-f67e4e28117e
John Terry-led 'True Blues' consortium attempts to secure 10% stake in Chelsea for ¬£250m,"Chelsea legend¬†John Terry and former women's football star Claire Rafferty are fronting up a ¬£250 million ($329m) consortium¬†called True Blues in an attempt to buy a 10 percent stake in the club.¬† With Terry having delved into the world of Non-fungible tokens [NFTs]¬†recently, the bid promises a high-tech approach, allowing supporters, players and former staff to buy fan tokens for upwards of ¬£100 in exchange for¬†voting rights.¬† However, the group¬†won't be able to fund a full bid¬†so must insert itself into a wider deal involving UK, US or Saudi billionaires.¬† Although the True Blues consortium¬†is headed up by two high-profile former footballers, there are several other people driving the bid. In documents seen by GOAL, one figure behind the bid is Chelsea supporter and prominent Tory party¬†donor David Meller, alongside his son Jonathan. Harley Kisberg, founder of iTech Media, and Stanford Loudon, an investment banker,¬†are also among fellow fans and¬†founding members.¬† These connections have allowed those involved to speak with senior¬†staff at the club before launching the bid.¬† Meller, whose wealth comes from his luxury property and family beauty business, could attract some criticism towards the group. He was awarded a lucrative ¬£164m PPE contract during the coronavirus pandemic after supporting¬†Michael Gove's Conservative Party leadership bid, with documents claiming he¬†benefited from a controversial 'VIP lane' that allowed influential individuals an opportunity to circumvent the usual procurement process.¬† Furthermore, he was the chairman of the President's Club, a high-end, men-only charity event, which led to a sexual harassment scandal.¬† After the scandal, MPs¬†subsequently lobbied for him to step down from a senior position in the Department for Education (DfE) after a report was released by the Financial Times.¬† Meller is also said to have previously worked with Chelsea in a charitable capacity. The plans, which have been seen by GOAL, suggest they will offer tokens to Kai Havertz for scoring his Champions League-winning goal and club captain Cesar Azpilicueta.¬†It would effectively offer current¬†players shares for their impact on the pitch.¬† The plans have already been presented to prominent fans ahead of the announcement in an attempt to begin a charm offensive.¬† It comes after the¬†Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST), the west Londoners' most influential fan group, called for several measures including a 'golden share' to be issued.¬† That golden share would allow Blues fans veto power over matters relating to the club's identity including¬†the¬†club badge, kit or stadium, or playing in a different league. The last point is important after¬†Chelsea were involved in the Super League project which was widely derided by the vast majority of the British public.¬† They went on to make six further requests but neither the UK Government nor Raine Group, who are conducting the sale, will enforce any such measures.  It remains on the negotiating parties to choose to bring in any fans through either the golden share or the True Blues consortium. However, for the True Blues consortium to even be considered, it will need considerable momentum from supporters.  The principal consortium partners now have until Friday at 9pm UK time (5pm EST) to make their offers.  The list will then be whittled down to three or four bids for further discussions and negotiations before a decision is finally made.  The government is not involved in any of the decision-making but is simply there to ensure Roman Abramovich doesn't take any of the money while he is sanctioned. The money will either be frozen or given to charity. ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/john-terry-true-blue-consortium-chelsea/bltca34870cca575d1e,Nizaar Kinsella,26fab317-7b4f-440b-94c5-cae1c024d0fe
Juventus eye Italy star Berardi as Di Maria deal threatens to fall apart amid Barcelona interest,"Juventus are eyeing the capture of Italy star Domenico Berardi as their potential deal to sign Angel Di Maria is suddenly in doubt amid interest from Barcelona. Di Maria had been heavily linked with the Bianconeri following the confirmation that he would leave Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer. However, late interest from Barcelona is threatening to spoil Juventus' deal, with the Italian giants more than willing to pounce for Berardi rather than wait for a delayed Di Maria decision. Juventus have long been seen as the favourites to sign Di Maria, who has left PSG after 295 games over seven seasons. However, Barca have emerged as a last-gasp suitor, with the Argentine's status as a free transfer an enticing one for a club that has little money to spend. Juventus still hope to sign Di Maria, but aren't prepared to be patient as the club wants a quick response from the attacking star. Should the Di Maria signing fail to materialise, Juventus are ready to turn to Sassuolo star Berardi, who has also been linked to Milan. The 27-year-old Italian international, who has earned 24 career caps with the Azzurri, was previously with Juventus between 2013 and 2015 but failed to make an appearance for the club. He spent the entirety of his Bianconeri tenure on loan with Sassuolo before joining the club permanently after the 2014-15 season where, in total, he has scored 120 goals in 325 appearances for Sassuolo.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-eye-italy-star-berardi-as-di-maria-deal-threatens/blt66728b0d30ff04bf,Romeo Agresti,9670a54b-a7fa-4c59-8f7e-bdf314be87c8
Top-class Liverpool close on top spot: Relentless Reds record ninth consecutive win at Arsenal,"Arsenal 0-2 Liverpool: Match Statistics From chewed nails and frayed nerves to beaming smiles and pumping chests, and all in the space of a dozen minutes. Liverpool‚Äôs relentless march goes on. The Premier League title race is now firmly in their hands after they did what Manchester City failed to do earlier this week ‚Äì win a tight, tense game in London. This 2-0 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates moves the Reds to within a single point of the league leaders, and all roads now lead to the Etihad Stadium next month.¬† It could be the showdown to end all showdowns. It is nights like this, weeks like this, which can shift the momentum decisively.¬† After City stuttered at Crystal Palace on Monday night, Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side knew they had to take full advantage, and they did.¬† They‚Äôve won their last nine league games now, eating up a deficit that stood at 14 points (albeit with games in hand) just seven weeks ago. It was a game which turned sharply in a 12-minute spell after half-time.¬† The Slotta.Arsenal's worst nightmare üò± pic.twitter.com/kzOCOUrSEW Liverpool had looked lethargic throughout the opening 45 minutes, and when Thiago Alcantara left a backpass short just five minutes after break, it looked like they were about to pay the price for their sloppiness. But when you have the best goalkeeper around, you always have a chance, and Alisson Becker, as he so often does, bailed his team out when they needed him.¬† He stood big to close down the angle on Alexandre Lacazette and then, when the ball was fed to Martin Odegaard, spread himself superbly to turn the Norwegian‚Äôs effort over the bar.¬† The visitors, suddenly, could breathe again. At that point, the wayward backpass had been Thiago‚Äôs biggest contribution to proceedings, but he would make a proper one within a few minutes, sliding a perfect ball through for Diogo Jota, whose powerful strike caught Aaron Ramsdale out at his near post.¬† The goalkeeper should have done much better, but Jota won‚Äôt care; he has eight goals in six Liverpool appearances against the Gunners, and five in his last three at the Emirates. The Portuguese international was substituted immediately after his goal, as was Luis Diaz, Klopp showing off the depth of his squad by bringing on Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah, who had shaken off an ankle injury to feature. Their impact was immediate, Firmino‚Äôs pressing creating a chance for Salah which was scrambled off the line.¬† Unperturbed, Andy Robertson kept the ball alive against Bukayo Saka on the Liverpool left before crossing low for Firmino, who steered the ball under Ramsdale at the near post. The celebrations were big, Firmino jumping into the jubilant away supporters. A yellow card never felt better.¬† He knew how big a goal it was; Liverpool know how big a win this was.

"West Ham 'far down the line' to signing Luis Diaz before Liverpool stepped in, claims Moyes","West Ham were in advanced talks to sign Luis Diaz from Porto before Liverpool swooped in, says David Moyes. The winger moved to Anfield in the January transfer window in a deal worth ¬£50 million (‚Ç¨60m/$67m). However, the Reds were not the only Premier League team interested in landing him, and Moyes has revealed the Hammers were real contenders.  Moyes said: ‚ÄúI spoke to Luis Diaz on the phone and we were quite far down the line. My understanding was Liverpool were not going to come in for him until the summer. So we tried to get him in January. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if us trying to get him in January affected Liverpool‚Äôs decision, but he‚Äôs a really good player and we didn‚Äôt get him.‚Äù The 25-year-old earned rave reviews from manager Jurgen Klopp after his Premier League debut. He played the full 90 minutes against Leicester shortly after his arrival, with the Reds running out 2-0 winners. ""When we saw him play for Porto we thought that is exactly what we want him to do as well. On top of that, he looks a really smart football player. He looks like a Liverpool player,"" Klopp said. Diaz went on to score his first Premier League goal for the club in his second appearance as they beat Norwich 3-1. He has since featured five times for Klopp's side.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/west-ham-signing-luis-diaz-liverpool-moyes/blt79433aa8511f7caa,By Peter McVitie,dbdde61c-5e59-44dc-b3b8-649cea22cd98
Fabio Blanco: The new wonderkid Barcelona beat Real Madrid to sign,"With the arrivals of Ferran Torres, Adama Traore and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Barcelona completed what manager Xavi set out to do in the January transfer window: improve the team's forward line. The early evidence is encouraging too, after the Blaugrana put four past Atletico Madrid on Sunday, with Traore in particular playing a starring role at Camp Nou. Yet while Barca hope that 21-year-old Torres will continue to improve and eventually become a leader of their attack for another decade at least, there is no doubt Traore and particularly Aubameyang are more short-term fixes. With that in mind, then perhaps a more important January addition for the future of Barcelona's forward line is teenager Fabio Blanco. The 17-year-old arrived in Catalunya early in the January window, and was immediately handed a two-and-a-half year contract that includes a ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£84m/$114m) release clause. His arrival is seen as a coup, particularly since only months ago Barcelona were left disappointed at having missed out on signing one of the top young Spanish talents. Barca, along with Real Madrid, were locked in a battle to sign Blanco in the summer of 2021 as his contract at Valencia entered its final weeks. Manchester City were also reported to be keen, but it was Eintracht Frankfurt who surprisingly won the race for Blanco's signature, with the success of other teenage imports to the Bundesliga likely a deciding factor as the winger sought a path towards first-team football. Barca, in particular, were disappointed having closely tracked Blanco for over a year, and sources within the club have told GOAL that they felt they were in the driving seat to sign the youngster before their contract offer was surprisingly rejected. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Blanco's time in Germany, however, did not go to plan. Soon after he arrived, Eintracht had a mass changeover of staff, hiring a new chairman, sporting director and manager, none of who were involved in the decision to sign Blanco. He never looked close to making the first team, and instead played just eight matches for Eintracht's Under-19s side, scoring two goals. By the time the winter window rolled around, he was ready to leave Deutsche Bank Park. Although Madrid again showed an interest, this time Barcelona seemed the ideal destination, particularly since Xavi has shown a willingness to give youth a chance during his first months in charge. Barca also had the advantage of having staff at the club who knew Blanco from his time at Valencia. Jose Ramon Alexanko, who is now the head of La Masia, brought Blanco to Mestalla from Almeria back in 2016, while Barcelona's much-heralded new sporting director, Mateu Alemany, was the man who oversaw Blanco's final contract renewal during his time at Los Che. So what makes Blanco so special that clubs such as Barca and Real Madrid were so keen to get their hands on him? Described to GOAL by a youth coach who has followed Blanco's career as a ""very interesting winger, with a lot of intelligence and physical strength"", Blanco plays predominantly off the right-hand side. Unlike many modern wingers, he favours going down the outside of the opposition full-back to provide crosses for his team-mates, with his fearless attitude and acceleration also key parts of his game. The Spain youth international also possesses a decent eye for goal having started out his footballing education as a central striker, and Barca fans are hoping to see him showcase that in the coming months and years. He has begun life at his new club in the Barcelona 'B' squad, allowing him to play men's football in the third division of the Spanish game. Blanco made his debut in the 'Mini Clasico' against Real Madrid Castilla in late January, coming off the bench to help the Catalan outfit come from 2-0 down to grab a point, before being named in the starting line-up the following week against Algeciras. Given the new arrivals in Xavi's squad, Blanco will likely remain with the 'B' team until further notice, with Xavi now having a wealth of more experienced options to choose from in attack. However, when fans look back on the January transfer window of 2022 in the coming years, there is real hope that they will do so not only because it singled a rebirth of the club's ambition, but also brought a star in the making to Camp Nou in the shape of Fabio Blanco.

Watch: Mount & Foden celebrate wildly in Wembley stands after England Women's historic Euros triumph,"Mason Mount and Phil Foden celebrated wildly together in the Wembley stands after seeing the England Women's team emerge triumphant over Germany in the Euro 2022 final. Ella Toone opened the scoring for the hosts just after the hour mark, but Germany's Lina Magull equalised late on to force extra time.  In the game's dying embers, Manchester City's Chloe Kelly tapped the ball home after a goalmouth scramble that ensured Sarina Wiegman's troops lifted the trophy - much to the delight of Mount and Foden. The two England men's national team stars were in attendance at Wembley to watch the Lionesses in live action, and were elated following their European Championship triumph. Chelsea midfielder Mount posted a video of the celebrations with Manchester City rival Foden as the pair sang along with the crowd and jumped up and down in jubilation after the final whistle. Tottenham striker Harry Kane, who plays alongside Mount and Foden for the England men's team, took to social media to congratulate the Lionesses and marvel at the ""unreal scenes"" at Wembley stadium.

From Robson to Maguire: Full list of Man Utd captains in the Premier League era,"There have been many great personalities who have led Manchester United, and while a few are still remembered fondly, some have faded from memory. In the early 1980s, 'Captain Marvel' Bryan Robson was given the captain's armband by Ron Atkinson. The coach broke the bank to sign Robson from West Brom for a then-British record transfer fee and had no qualms in handing over the captaincy to the midfielder.  It is believed that even former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly advised Atkinson to go all out for Robson. ""Every penny it takes Ron, every penny it takes,"" Shankly reportedly told Atkinson.  However, Sir Matt Busby quit the board because he thought no player could be worth more than a million pounds. In spite of that, Robson survived and United started to reap the dividends. In fact, when the Premier League era kicked off Robson still had the armband. However, his qualities were on the wane and Ferguson would often bench him, eventually leading Steve Bruce to take the armband.  Robson played 466 times for United and scored 99 goals. He was the United captain for 12 years, sharing the role with Bruce for the last two years.  Who went on to serve as United's captains in the Premier League era?

'It's sad to leave a player at home' - Mancini explains omitting Balotelli from Italy squad,"Roberto Mancini has explained his decision to omit Mario Balotelli from his latest Italy squad, two months after his recall to the international fold. Former Manchester City and Milan forward Balotelli has won 36 caps for Italy, but has not played for his country since 2018. The 31-year-old, who currently plays for Turkish outfit Adana Demirspor, was drafted back into the Azzurri squad in January but Mancini opted against selecting him again when naming his 33-man group for the 2022 World Cup qualification play-offs. ‚ÄúI brought those who could be more useful,‚Äù the Italy head coach told a press conference ahead of their semi-final clash with North Macedonia. ‚ÄúWe only have a few training sessions. There isn‚Äôt much time to try new things. The basis is made by players who were part of the team at Euro 2020, except [Federico] Bernardeschi, who is not fully fit.  ""I couldn‚Äôt call 40 players. We have called strikers with different characteristics for these games.‚Äù Cagliari striker Joao Pedro was drafted in for the latest round of international fixtures instead of Balotelli, with the 30-year-old boasting ten goals and four assists from 29 Serie A appearances so far this season. Pedro, who was born in Brazil but is an Italian citizen by marriage, was chosen for his versatility as Mancini looks to ensure the Azzurri book a place in the final of their UEFA qualifying section against either Portugal or Turkey. ""There are no big reasons [for picking Pedro over Balotelli,"" the 57-year-old said. ""Even in terms of numbers, there wasn‚Äôt much more I could do. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always sad to leave a player at home, whether he is Balotelli, [Davide] Calabria or Bernardeschi, but that‚Äôs my choice.

Ronaldo ready to 'fight' as he aims to steer Portugal into what could be his last World Cup ahead of Turkey play-off showdown,"Cristiano Ronaldo has vowed to ‚Äúfight‚Äù for Portugal‚Äôs right to grace the 2022 World Cup, with the Manchester United superstar determined to figure at what could be his last major global showpiece. The five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner is now 37 years of age and, despite stating on a regular basis that he intends to extend a remarkable career into his 40s, is approaching the end of his playing days. He has graced four World Cup tournaments in the past, while savouring European Championship glory in 2016, and intends to reach a fifth as Portugal prepare to face Turkey in a play-off semi-final on Thursday. Victory over Turkey would line up an all-or-nothing final showdown with either Italy or North Macedonia on March 29, with Ronaldo already setting his sights on a place in Qatar. He posted on Instagram: ‚ÄúTotal focus on the 2022 World Cup. ‚ÄúProud, as always, to represent Portugal. ‚ÄúWe know that the path will not be easy, we have the utmost respect for the opponents we will face and who share the same goals as us. ‚ÄúBut together, we will fight to put Portugal in its rightful place. Let's do it!‚Äù Portugal could not wish to have a more talismanic presence at their disposal when taking aim at another World Cup finals, with Ronaldo continuing to send records tumbling. He is the all-time leading goalscorer in men‚Äôs international football with 115 efforts to his name and has won more caps, 184, than any other European player. Ronaldo is the only player in history to have found the target at nine successive major tournaments ‚Äì with that run stretching back to Euro 2004 ‚Äì and is the leading scorer at European Championships with 14 goals on his resume. While Ronaldo, as national team captain, will be expected to lead by example for Portugal as they look to book tickets to Qatar, Fernando Santos has plenty of alternative match-winners in his ranks. One of those also plies his club trade at Old Trafford, with Bruno Fernandes echoing Ronaldo in a pre-match rallying call prior to lining up against Turkey. He has said on social media: ‚ÄúNow more than ever, we all need to be united. ‚ÄúWe will do everything to reach the World Cup.‚Äù Portugal last failed to reach the World Cup in 1998 and are currently sat eighth in the FIFA world rankings.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-fight-portugal-last-world-cup-turkey-play-off/blta235abef5be65117,Chris Burton,7fa386b4-a9fc-4370-a71c-ed74aa776a34
Inside Tom Brady's Man Utd visit: Chats with Ronaldo and awestruck players before NFL comeback announcement,"The Directors‚Äô Box at Old Trafford had a certain buzz about it even before Cristiano Ronaldo had netted a hat-trick to secure three points for Manchester United against Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. The padded-seat area in the south stand has hosted many a famous face over the years, but they do not all cause a stir in the way a certain 44-year-old American did on Saturday. ‚ÄúTom Brady‚Äôs in there,‚Äù was the whisper going around the corridors of Old Trafford three hours before kick-off. The seven-time Super Bowl champion, Brady was a guest of United‚Äôs owners the Glazer family, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the NFL franchise Brady had represented for the last two years prior to his retirement. The quarterback watched with his sons, John and Benjamin, and will not have been disappointed with the performance he saw. There was no sign of his supermodel wife, Gisele, or their daughter, as the trio enjoyed a boys‚Äô day out at Old Trafford. It started with a pre-match meal in the Directors‚Äô Lounge, before a chat with Sir Alex Ferguson and the club‚Äôs former kitman, Albert Morgan, in Ferguson‚Äôs private room.; While the other guests took to the stands before kick-off for an interview with the club‚Äôs in-house media, the NFL star stayed inside the Directors‚Äô Lounge, where he posed for selfies, before taking his seat for the game in front of United‚Äôs chief executive, Richard Arnold. He did not want any fanfare, but responded politely to every request for a picture from those who could get close to him. Brady would not pick a preference over who he wanted to win ahead of kick-off, but instead took to his social media channels to say he was supporting both Cristiano Ronaldo and Harry Kane. The England captain is a huge fan of the New England Patriots legend, and met up with his idol in the Old Trafford tunnel after the game before getting on the Tottenham team bus. Luckily for Brady, four of the five goals scored were by the two players he had turned up to support. He joined with everyone else in giving Ronaldo a standing ovation when he was substituted shortly after scoring his third and final goal. Kane was not the only big Brady fan at Old Trafford on Saturday, though. Ten of the United first team waited pitchside long after the final whistle to have a chat with one of the icons of U.S. sport. Those who witnessed the exchange between Brady and the players said some of them looked like excited fans, awestruck by his presence as they asked if they could have pictures taken alongside him. Brady and his two children had a group shot with David de Gea, Victor Lindelof, Fred, Scott McTominay, Phil Jones, Alex Telles, Harry Maguire, Jadon Sancho and Tom Heaton, before Ronaldo turned up to command an audience with him by himself. The rest of the team stood and watched on as Ronaldo and Brady chatted about the game. Brady congratulated the Portuguese star on his three goals, commending him for a ""good game"", before the United No.7 handed his match-worn shirt over to Brady‚Äôs son, Benjamin. After a brief chat about family, Ronaldo asked Brady if he was finished playing - he had announced his retirement six weeks earlier - and the latter could only smile in response. His return to the Buccaneers was confirmed a little over 24 hours later, suggesting he knew already that he was about to dominate the news agenda back home with an announcement on his future. Some on social media are hailing Ronaldo‚Äôs influence over Brady but, given the way the United players were in awe of him, it showed he is just as much of an inspiration across world sport as the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tom-brady-man-utd-ronaldo-nfl-comeback-announcement/blt354804f2591e37e6,Charlotte Duncker,eae2ef57-be86-4395-a20f-b0c449e21cc8
What we learned from Liverpool's win over Palace: From impressive Elliott to injury issues,"Liverpool completed their pre-season tour of the Far East with a dominant 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in Singapore.

Jurgen Klopp named a completely different XI for the second half, with the likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Thiago Alcantara and new signing Darwin Nunez all summoned. And they extended their lead within two minutes of the restart, Salah‚Äôs deflected shot squirming through the grasp of Palace keeper Vicente Guaita for 2-0.

Afcon 2021: ‚ÄòThe Gambia's future looks bright‚Äô ‚Äì Cherno Samba lauds Scorpions despite Cameroon loss,"Cherno Samba has described the Gambia players as ""heroes"" despite their 2-0 loss to Cameroon in Saturday‚Äôs Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final clash. Lifted by their triumph over Gabon in the Round of 16, the Scorpions needed to negotiate their way past the Indomitable Lions to earn a semi-final ticket. Unfortunately for them, that ambition faded into thin air as Karl Toko-Ekambi‚Äôs second-half brace powered the hosts through at the Japoma Stadium in Douala. Asked if he was saddened that the fairy tale of Tom Saintfiet‚Äôs men has come to an end, the former Gambia international expressed his delight with his compatriots‚Äô performance ‚Äì insisting the future looks promising for the West African country. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not disappointed because they have made us all proud. These players are all heroes,‚Äù Samba told GOAL. ‚ÄúWe were not the best team today as Cameroon dominated us. But the future looks bright for the Gambia and I‚Äôm excited to for the country of my birth. ‚ÄúHopefully,‚Äù I can help in assisting some talents to top clubs.‚Äù The former Malaga and Plymouth Argyle striker believes the Scorpions were undone by their sluggish display as well as fatigue ‚Äì having in mind they played for 120 minutes against the Panthers. ‚ÄúI feel it was a combination of both, they look lethargic at times, however saying all this Cameroon were just too strong for us,‚Äù he continued. Following their historic qualification for their maiden Afcon, Saintfiet's contract was extended by five years by the Gambia Football Federation, ¬†with the new deal running through the end of May 2026. Assessing the Belgian tactician's future, the 37-year-old wants him to remain at the helm of affairs since he lived up to expectations. ‚ÄúI believe he [Saintfiet] has done more than enough to continue, we need to remember that he got us to this point,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd from experience, staying with a coach and giving it time mostly works out. He knows the players and it‚Äôs always good to have a great rapport with the players and he seems to have it. ‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs not broken, don‚Äôt fix it!

Barcelona spend big again as Lewandowski completes sensational ‚Ç¨50m transfer from Bayern Munich,"Barcelona have confirmed an agreement to sign Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich as Xavi‚Äôs rebuild at Camp Nou continues apace. The confirmation of the deal comes at the end of a saga which began before even the 2021-22 season was over, and ends with Barca once more having a modern icon of the game on their books, a year on from Lionel Messi's departure. Barcelona will pay an initial fee of ‚Ç¨45 million (¬£38m/$45m) to bring Lewandowski to Catalunya, with a further ‚Ç¨5m (¬£4.3m/$5m) potentially due in add-ons if certain clauses are met. A statement from the club read: ""FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of Robert Lewandowski, dependent on the player passing a medical and contracts being signed."" Agreement in principle for the transfer of Robert Lewandowskiüîó https://t.co/quEclaHkdl https://t.co/YTCRbaW173 Lewandowski is expected to sign an initial three-year contract with an option to extend it by a further year, meaning he could remain at Camp Nou through until the end of the 2025-26 season. Barcelona's financial issues have been well documented this summer, leading to eyebrows being raised at the arrival of Lewandowski and Barca's other new signings. Blaugrana president Joan Laporta was given permission to sell club assets by the Barca members' assembly last June as they targeted investment funds capable of providing financing so that operations could run as normal in the short term. They successfully sold a first package of financial assets before striking a ‚Ç¨207.5 million (¬£176m/$207m) deal with investment group Sixth Street on June 30, 2022. The club sold 10 per cent of its La Liga TV rights to the US firm, which ensured that they turned a profit at the end of the 2021-22 financial year - taking a giant step towards reversing their money woes in the process. A second economic lever is now being worked on to raise funds so that Barca no longer exceed La Liga's salary limit, with another 15 per cent of their TV rights set to be sold in return for an extra ‚Ç¨300m (¬£254m/$300m). The Blaugrana are also selling 49.9% of the shares of the Barca Licensing and Merchandising company, which will bring their total revenue for the summer beyond ‚Ç¨600m (¬£509m/$600m) and allow them to register new players for the 2022-23 season. Back in May, Lewandowski expressed his desire to leave Bayern Munich, rather than see out the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. While Bayern initially were not happy with the public announcement of the player, they have now ultimately decided to let him leave. Robert Lewandowski reaches 50 goals for the season üî• pic.twitter.com/QvwiLd2NnN Speaking to Bild on Saturday, Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn said: ‚ÄúIn the end, Barcelona offered a sum that selling him made absolute sense for us. ‚ÄúWe've also recently been very successful in the transfer market and signed an absolutely world-class player for the offence in Sadio Mane."" Though notionally a wide player, Mane may well be tasked with leading the line from a central position once the new Bundesliga season starts if Bayern do not sign a direct Lewandowski replacement. The 33-year-old Poland forward will almost certainly be a regular starter for Barcelona, but will face competition from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who joined the club in January 2022 and regularly featured in Xavi‚Äôs line-up as a No.9 in the second half of last season. Memphis Depay is also still at the club, though there remains an expectation that he could be sold before the end of the transfer window. Lewandowski will not be short of creative players around him, either, with the signing of Raphinha from Leeds United and the decision to tie Ousmane Dembele down to a new contract meaning they will be battling with Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres for starting berths out wide. Barcelona have already completed the signings of Raphinha, Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie as well as Lewandowski, but they are not done yet. Chelsea full-back duo Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso are both on Xavi's summer wish list, while Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva is also a target, though they may be priced out of a move for the Portugal international. Further central defensive reinforcements have also been discussed, with Sevilla's Jules Kounde thought to be an option after they missed out on Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-lewandowski-completes-transfer-bayern-munich/blte8dc6730c81dea0c,Ritabrata Banerjee,882f26e9-895d-4a34-abb5-b6a3ac85947f

Is Ted Lasso character Roy Kent based on Roy Keane?,"American sports comedy-drama television series Ted Lasso tells the story of an American college football coach who is hired by an English team called AFC Richmond. The series garnered immense critical acclaim and went on to become the most nominated freshman comedy in Emmy award history. The titular character Lasso is played by Jason Sudeikis, while AFC Richmond captain is Roy Kent, portrayed by Brett Goldstein, who is in the twilight of his career and is a box-to-box midfielder. Aggressive and known for his sharp temper, Kent bears striking resemblances to former Manchester United skipper Roy Keane, but is the Irishman really the template? GOAL takes a look... This page contains affiliate links. When you subscribe through the links provided, we may earn a commission. The Roy Kent character in Ted Lasso is heavily inspired by the real-life superstar Roy Keane. In the show, Kent is well respected by his teammates and after a glittering career, where he won the UEFA Champions League with Chelsea, he is currently in his last lap and has hence joined AFC Richmond. Like Keane, who wore the armband at Manchester United, Kent is also the captain of his team. They are almost identical in their build and play at the centre of the park. Another @PremierLeague season down and still no one can break this record. On this day in 2017, Roy Kent made history. pic.twitter.com/79iBqdN6xO Brendan Hunt, a co-creator of the show, revealed that Keane's clash with Mick McCarthy, which resulted in his ejection from the Ireland squad ahead of the 2002 World Cup, was prominent in the thinking behind Kent's character dynamics. ""When we were getting into football, (it) was the peak era of Manchester United‚Ä¶that butted up against the Roy Keane soap opera of the 2002 World Cup. And though I was not a Man United fan, and I'm still not, I just was fascinated by Roy Keane,"" Hunt said while on Irish radio network Spin 103.8.¬† ""When we're putting this together as a show we said, ‚ÄòWe know that Ted's nice, what is an existing football archetype that he would have to deal with?‚Äô And we could think of no greater obstacle than human bummer Roy Keane in his midst."" At the pre-production stage, Roy Kent was just a placeholder name for the character. With time, however, the name stuck.

Just like Keane, Kent takes up football coaching after hanging up his boots as he returns as an assistant manager to Lasso at Richmond. Similarly, Keane also took up the job of an assistant manager of the Irish national team in 2013 and later in the same capacity at Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest.

USWNT bounces back at SheBelieves Cup with assist from generous New Zealand own goals,"The U.S. women's national team was looking for an attacking spark after Thursday night‚Äôs scoreless draw with Czech Republic and they found it on Sunday ‚Äì with a major assist from New Zealand. The USWNT took advantage of an unprecedented first-half hat-trick of own goals from Meikayla Moore ‚Äì whose 50th international cap will be memorable for all the wrong reasons ‚Äì as they cruised to a 5-0 victory in the second of three SheBelieves Cup matches. The Football Ferns offered a far more disjointed defensive performance than the Czechs did and the USWNT took full advantage as Sophia Smith and Midge Purce caused particular chaos on the flanks. Vlatko Andonovski will be happy to see his side bounce back ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs tournament finale against Iceland, but he‚Äôll still have plenty to dissect as he looks to clinch the SheBelieves Cup with a win. Here are three observations from Sunday‚Äôs match at Dignity Health Sports Park Before Sunday, the USWNT had never been the beneficiary of three own goals in a game in its entire history. Against New Zealand it happened within 38 minutes, and all of them were scored by the same player. Ouch. When Moore was removed in the 40th minute it could have been read as an act of mercy from New Zealand coach Jitka Klimkova, but it seemed a bit harsh to shine a brighter light on the defender‚Äôs errors when she could‚Äôve been more quietly taken off at the break. In her post-game press conference, Klimkova indicated she felt Moore wasn't up for the game mentally after her errors. ""A huge part in our game is mentality and if someone is ready to fight, then she's going to stay on the field,"" she said. ""Well, Meikayla is a thinker."" Of course, no own-goal hat-trick happens in a vacuum and it must be said that Moore was blameless on the second, and all three were the result of U.S. attackers putting in extremely dangerous services. It wasn‚Äôt Moore‚Äôs fault that American attackers had a free run on the flanks for most of the half. Ironically, Sunday should‚Äôve been a day to recognize a major achievement for Moore, who already has a half-century of caps at age 25. But she‚Äôll now have to simply take comfort in the fact that she is unlikely to ever have a tougher day in her career. One minute. Four minutes. Six minutes. That‚Äôs how long it‚Äôs taken Ashley Hatch to find the back of the net on her three most recent U.S. appearances. The NWSL Golden Boot winner continued making her case for more minutes at the No.9 position by scoring a 51st-minute header against New Zealand after coming on as a halftime substitute. She makes an instant impact...@ash_hatch33's last 3 caps:Nov. 27 ‚Äî Scores 24 seconds after kickoffNov. 30  ‚Äî Scores 3:16 after kickoffFeb. 20 - Scores 5:12 after entering match pic.twitter.com/EBh4NezCRN Hatch was only making her fifth USWNT appearances but the 26-year-old appears to be putting it all together for club and country at the right time, with Andonovski seemingly open to a generational change at his team‚Äôs attacking positions. Another NWSL star making her case is Sofia Huerta, whose first-half cross led to an own goal and whose second-half cross set up Hatch‚Äôs header. On Sunday Alyssa Naeher made her first start for the USWNT since last summer‚Äôs Olympics, and the goalkeeper returned to a different situation than the one she left in Japan. Casey Murphy had started the previous three U.S. games in goal and was hugely impressive, showing Naeher may have a fight on her hands to retain the starting role, particularly if she is unable to stay healthy. Naeher was not tested much against New Zealand but was solid when called upon. How Andonovski manages his goalkeeping situation, with NWSL standout Aubrey Kingsbury also on his roster, will be a storyline worth monitoring. In his post-game press conference, Andonovski hinted that Naeher is still his team's starter until proven otherwise. ""We have three super quality goalkeepers and just like in every other position, the goalkeeping position is a battle,"" the coach said. ""We know that Casey had a few good performances but we also know that it takes a little bit more than just two good games to be a quality international goalkeeper.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uswnt-bounces-back-at-shebelieves-cup-with-assist-from/bltc949799459203811,By Seth Vertelney,e9e67fa2-9c71-4aa5-b059-24672beaed8d
Messi stars in Argentina victory over Italy in La Finalissima as South American champions defeat European rivals,"Lionel Messi was the star of the show as Argentina ran out 3-0 winners against Italy in La Finalissima on Wednesday. The Copa America champions and Euro 2020 winners met at Wembley to battle it out for the intercontinental trophy. The Albiceleste were deserved winners as they struck three times without reply against Roberto Mancini's team. Lautaro Martinez, Angel Di Maria and Paulo Dybala were all on target for Argentina as they secured the win. International trophies mean the world to Lionel Messi ü•∫ pic.twitter.com/X8HFxtSRBy Lionel Scaloni's team were two goals ahead by half-time, with Messi setting up Inter star Martinez for the first goal shortly before the half-hour mark and Di Maria firing home in stoppage time. Messi got his second assist in the dying seconds of the game when he set up Dybala to make it 3-0. Manchester City's incoming attacker Julian Alvarez was also in on the action as he came on to replace Martinez after 84 minutes. The Paris Saint-Germain star was given the Man of the Match award for his stellar display against the Azzurri. üá¶üá∑üèÜ pic.twitter.com/nIIhRaBmLx As well as his two assists, the 34-year-old was pulling the strings for the Copa America winners, inspiring his side to a big win. The UEFA Technical Observer Panel declaired: ""He controlled the game from start to finish. He showed great skill to make the assist for Lautaro Martinez and more chances for his team-mates, and was unlucky not to score himself.  ""He has really put in a masterclass of a performance for the Wembley crowd; it was a joy to watch."" Giorgio Chiellini was rewarded in recognition of his exemplary performances with the Italian national team ahead of the game. The match at Wembley marked the end of the centre-back's caareer with the Azzurri. Chiellini bows out with 117 caps for Italy having won Euro 2020 and been part of the team that finished runners-up in the competition in 2012. Roberto Mancini admitted that the better team won the encounter, telling reporters: ¬†""They were better than us.  ""We were in the game in the first half but didn't do enough to turn it around after the break."" Speaking after his team's triumph, Messi said: ""We're here to play anyone. Today was a nice test because Italy are a great team.

Sterling joins the 100 club and is getting back to his brilliant best,"The ""100"" emoji got plenty of use after Manchester City's Premier League victory over Wolves even if it was an easily forgettable game. Ederson claimed his 100th clean sheet in a City shirt but spent the majority of the match 50 yards away from the action; his only meaningful save was a simple tip over deep in injury time to ensure there was no shock result. The other use of the emoji was for Raheem Sterling as he became the 32nd player to score a century of goals in the Premier League and the eighth-youngest after turning 27 on Wednesday. While it‚Äôs a milestone earned through his consistency over a long period at Liverpool and City - with only Sergio Aguero scoring more goals for City under Pep Guardiola - from a short-term perspective it underlined how Sterling's confidence is streaming back after a difficult 12 months at club level. His 100th goal wasn‚Äôt a spectacular dribble or a long-range shot as he perhaps might have wanted. It was just a simple pass into the back of the net from the spot after a controversial penalty awarded for handball. But the ease with which he rolled the ball into the net, sending Wolves' keeper Jose Sa the wrong way, is a symbol of a Sterling right at his best. ‚ÄúAs soon as I saw the referee point to the spot, I picked my place and went with it,‚Äù he told BT Sport. ‚ÄúIt was really nice to see it go in. Once I‚Äôve got a decision I stick with it and it‚Äôs just about the execution.‚Äù City‚Äôs penalty record in recent years has been patchy, with a third of the last 30 penalties missed including three by Sterling. Just over two years ago he missed from the spot in a 3-2 defeat to Wolves. In fact, he missed it twice after his first was retaken because of VAR. He also missed his next two from the spot against Watford and Brighton. So it was no surprise that there were a few anxious sideways glances among City fans when Sterling put the ball down on the spot on Saturday. After seeing the way he stroked the ball home for his fifth goal in eight games, you wondered what all the fuss was about. ‚ÄúRaheem showed the personality to take it and score the goal and these are the precious values I appreciate,‚Äù Guardiola said. ‚ÄúThe guys who missed before still take responsibility to do it and this is so important.‚Äù It‚Äôs a swing back to form for the England international, who had only scored three league goals for the season before kick-off while he struggled to secure a regular placer in the team. It‚Äôs led to unhappiness from the winger, who suggested he would consider a move away in search of regular football, and the arrival of ¬£100 million ($133m) man Jack Grealish, who along with academy star Phil Foden can play on the left hand side, has ramped up the pressure on him considerably. With 18 months remaining on his contract, there is the possibility that a decision over his future will have to be taken relatively soon. To see him happy and playing in style is a bonus for the player and club. Guardiola is one to push his players, including Sterling, to strive to get better and throughout his dip form has challenged him to get better. But in recent weeks he‚Äôs singled him out for praise and he did so again after looking the most dangerous threat against Wolves. ‚ÄúRaheem has always been important but players have to understand they sometimes drop [form], there are highs and lows in their careers,‚Äù Guardiola added. ‚ÄúWhat we want is the best for them. I am unfair sometimes because they are performing well and they don‚Äôt play and I don‚Äôt have an excuse to say I‚Äôm sorry. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs scored lately, he‚Äôs so aggressive, he commits players like he‚Äôs always done and what he has done has always been incredibly important.‚Äù Sterling is heading back into his highest form and with City's goal tally considerably lower than recent seasons, the timing is perfect.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sterling-joins-the-100-club-and-is-getting-back-to-his-brilliant-/blt7d30d98f713b5e79,Jonathan Smith,01bc6440-c4d5-4946-836e-41da0e825ed5
Bayern Munich newcomer Mane: These children are my motivation!,"Sadio Mane has revealed that the adulation he has received from Bayern Munich's young supporters will motivate him this season. Mane completed a blockbuster switch from Liverpool this summer and has hit the ground running, netting his side's second goal in a 5-3 victory over RB Leipzig in the DFL-Supercup on Saturday.  He has proven an instant hit with fans, just as he did at Anfield. In fact, children were recently spotted climbing trees to catch a glimpse of him at his inaugural training session.  ""Yes, and I was very happy. The fact that children climb trees especially for me motivates me immensely, of course,"" he said in an interview posted on Bayern's official website. ""I want to do my best here every day in training and in matches - for the team and the fans.  ""I still remember today that as a child, I admired great players and wanted to be like them. That's why it's very important to me to make children happy with my play. Children, they say, are also the most honest critics."" ""My idols back then were Ronaldinho and El Hadji Diouf from Senegal,"" he added. ""They were outstanding players. I watched videos of them for hours and tried to imitate everything they did. ""My mother gave me an El Hadji Diouf jersey, and when I was a bit older I bought one of Ronaldinho's myself. I worked extra, earned money and saved up for it. It was a dream to wear his name on the back. I didn't even want to take the jerseys off, I wore a different one every day."" Yes, very.  Over the course of his career, he has funded a string of infrastructure projects in his birth village on Bambali in Senegal.  ""Whenever I can, I visit my parents and my old friends in Bambali. It's a small village, a long way from the nearest town,"" Mane explained. ""Life there is very different from Europe. I find it hard to put into words, the cultures are too different and the situation for the people there isn't easy.  ""That keeps you grounded. When I'm there, I'm the Sadio of old. I play football with my old friends, we have fun together.  ""I always really enjoy going back. My country is made up of 17 million football-mad people, and they're all Bayern fans now. I think you'll see a lot of Senegal flags in the Allianz Arena this season."" Most recently, Mane hosted a gala match in Bambali which featured some famous faces such as Papiss Cisse, Mbaye Diagne, Desire Segbe and Mane's former childhood hero, Diouf.

Chelsea's Emerson unsure on future but happy to return to Stamford Bridge,"Emerson Palmieri will be happy if Thomas Tuchel says that his future lies with Chelsea ahead of pre-season talks that will decide his future. The full-back had a successful season on loan at Lyon but could have seen his deal in France cut short as his parent club attempted to recall him after a serious injury to Ben Chilwell. The Ligue 1 giants rejected the west Londoners' repeated attempts to bring back Emerson, but - in perfect English, which he carried on learning while in France - he explained his current situation. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt speak with [head coach Thomas Tuchel] just yet,‚Äù Emerson said, speaking after Italy‚Äôs 3-0 defeat to Argentina on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI have a contract with Chelsea. I played there for three seasons and I have a lot of friends there. If I come back, I'll be happy. It's a good place and club for me. I don‚Äôt know [whether I will return], let‚Äôs see what can happen.‚Äù Adding on his newly-found confidence in English: ‚ÄúYes, I improved it a bit!‚Äù ‚ÄúFor me, it was a good season because I played a lot of games,‚Äù Emerson went on. ‚ÄúOf course [it felt good that Chelsea wanted me in January]. Lyon said no, so I didn‚Äôt come back. It didn‚Äôt depend on me. Those conversations were between the clubs. ‚ÄúLyon said no and I respected that because when I signed there I signed for one year, not six months. But now I will go back to Chelsea in the pre-season I think and let‚Äôs see what happens in the next month.‚Äù The west Londoners begin pre-season on July 2 but international players will join the group a week later on July 9.

"Canada vs USA: Predictions, odds & betting tips","This article contains affiliate links. We may receive a commission on any sales we generate from it The top two sides in CONCACAF World Cup qualifying meet on Sunday in Hamilton as leaders Canada take on second-placed USA. The hosts are the only unbeaten side left in the tournament and managed to claim a 1-1 draw when they faced their southern neighbours back in September. USMNT, meanwhile, have steadied the ship since losing to Panama in October by recording three wins and a draw in their last four qualifiers and both of these nations are well placed to qualify for this winter's World Cup. The last time these sides met on Canadian soil was in 2019 when the hosts recorded a 2-0-win ending a near 30 year wait for a victory over their more illustrious rivals. Another success for John Herdman's side can be backed at 15/8 (2.88) with bet365 while the USA are available at 8/5 (2.60) and the draw at 2/1 (3.00). Ricardo Pepi is the shortest priced player to open the scoring at 5/1 (6.00) ahead of his teammate Gyasi Zardes and Canadian forward Jonathan Davis who are both offered at 6/1 (7.00). Chelsea's Christian Pulisic meanwhile is offered at 13/2 (7.50). Both sides head into the game in strong form and both will be confident of claiming a positive result, although both would also surely be happy to avoid defeat. The USMNT have not been overly prolific in recent matches netting a solitary goal in each of their last three matches against Jamaica, Bosnia and El Salvador respectively, although the fact they have scored with regularity should be viewed as a positive. Canada for their part have scored in each of their last nine home qualifiers during which time they have kept just four clean sheets, and backing these two in-form sides to both score should be an attractive option. Both teams to score is priced at evens (2.00) which looks like an excellent option at a healthy price, given both sides' respective scoring records. Odds correct at time of writing. begambleaware.org   ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/canada-vs-usa-predictions-odds-and-betting-tips/bltfe823b5a988b9737,Phil Kitromilides,eaacd85f-1c0a-45b2-8ee2-41f714b86686
France vs Bafana Bafana: Decades-long problem still haunts South Africa,"Bafana Bafana‚Äôs inability to produce top quality strikers has been an ongoing issue for the past 20 years. Back in the mid to late 1990‚Äôs South Africa possessed an abundance of reliable marksmen, including Benni McCarthy, Shaun Bartlett, Daniel Mudau, Phil Masinga, Mark Williams, Brendan Augustine and Siyabonga Nomvethe. It was Williams who netted a brace to help Bafana win the 1996 Afcon, while it was the likes of Bartlett, McCarthy and Masinga who ensured South Africa qualify for their first-ever World Cup. Coincidentally, Bafana‚Äôs first opponents at the World Cup were France, and even with Bafana‚Äôs vast array of talent in that 1998 team, they were beaten 3-0 by the hosts. But that does not take away from the fact that back then, 24 years ago, South Africa had proper, proven strikers in their ranks.   Now, as Bafana prepare to meet the mighty French again, they head into the game on the back of a 0-0 draw against Guinea in which their lack of finishing prowess up front was exposed; had there been more composure, South Africa would have won that game comprehensively. It‚Äôs an issue Bafana coach Hugo Broos has admitted to: ""We know that we don't have a top scorer in South Africa ‚Äì one guy who only needs one chance to score,"" Broos told Safa media.  ""So there is a bit of a lack but again, it's something to do with confidence.¬†The day we start scoring, that problem will be solved.""  The one player who comes closest to a legitimate international-class striker, Percy Tau, has had injury issues over the past year or so, and in his absence, Broos has turned to a bunch of relatively young, unproven (at least internationally) strikers. No one has entirely convinced yet. Even before Broos, it‚Äôs been ages since Bafana had a forward they could rely on, someone they knew could win them matches. Over the past 10 or 15 years, it‚Äôs only really Katlego Mphela who has fallen into that category. What is the answer? If Bafana are to realise their full potential, they need to find ways to produce higher quality strikers. It could take years though as it would probably need to be implemented from grassroots level, where a more concerted effort must be made to identify and holistically train talented young strikers. Whether that involves getting former pros involved ‚Äì the likes of McCarthy, Nomvethe and Bartlett for example, or investing in more academies and School-of-Excellence-type institutions, it‚Äôs a challenge which Safa and the PSL need to address as the issue of scoring continues to hold South African football back.

Who could USMNT draw in World Cup 2022 group stage?,"Having missed out on the 2018 tournament in Russia, the United States national team will be eager to make their presence felt at World Cup 2022 in Qatar. Gregg Berhalter boasts a strong team of relatively youthful stars, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Giovanni Reyna, so there are grounds for optimism ahead of the competition. Who will they face in the group stage? GOAL takes a look at the potential opponents. The United States national team are second seeds in Pot 2 for the group stage draw. They will be drawn against one team from Pot 1, a team from Pot 3 and a team from Pot 4. In terms of top seeds, the USMNT could potentially face the current world number one - according to the latest FIFA ranking - Brazil, reigning world champions France or Lionel Messi's Argentina. Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal are also in Pot 1, as are England, Belgium and Spain. From Pot 3, Senegal, Iran and Japan are among the potential opponents, as are Morocco, Serbia, Poland, Tunisia and South Korea. Near neighbours Canada are in Pot 4, but FIFA's rules dictate that no more than one team from the same confederation should be in each group, so they cannot be grouped together (this doesn't apply to UEFA). However, Cameroon, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia and Ghana all remain potential opponents from this pot, as well as the winner of the UEFA play-off or the winner of the play-off bracket containing Peru, Australia and UAE. They cannot face another team from Pot 2, which rules out Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Uruguay, Switzerland, Croatia and neighbours Mexico (who they would not be able to face anyway since they are both CONCACAF teams). Check out the full seedings below.

"Morocco vs Malawi: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Morocco are looking to preserve their unbeaten record in this year‚Äôs Afcon when they take on a Malawi side making their first appearance in the last 16 of the competition. Vahid Halilhodzic‚Äôs team have not lost any of their last six meetings with Malawi and are out to maintain that encouraging record to guarantee their place in the quarter-finals. With the exception of their Arab Cup quarter-final loss to Algeria on penalties late last year, Morocco have been in incredible form over the last 18 months. They are 1/3 favourites with bet365 to win this contest. Malawi, who drew 0-0 with Senegal to scrape into the knockout phase of the competition are 10/1 to pull off a surprise. While Morocco have been dominant in contests between these two, their last meeting ‚Äì in March 2019 ‚Äì ended a 0-0 draw and you can get odds of 10/3 for this tie to be even after 90 minutes. Morocco forward Youssef En-Nesyri is available at 10/3 to score the first goal of the game. Gabadinho Mhango, who has scored both of Malawi‚Äôs goals in the tournament so far, can be backed at 12/1 to strike first. Morocco may be without midfielder Faycal Fajr for the clash with Malawi as he was forced to miss training because of an injury ahead of the last-16 tie. But the Atlas Lions will be able to call on striker Ryan Mmaee, who was sidelined for the duration of the group stage but trained with his team-mates for the first time on Friday. Vahid Halilhodzic's team finished top of their group with seven points, but Malawi will feel up to the task of overpowering a side who crashed out at the last-16 stage three years ago. ""The Morocco game is the biggest game of our lives and we are looking forward to it,"" said midfielder John Banda last week. ""We respect Morocco but don‚Äôt fear them. We played them twice in the Afcon three years ago and I played in both matches. They are a beatable side with a proper game plan."" As Morocco are in such convincing form and up against a team that lacks experience at this stage of the Africa Cup of Nations, odds of 5/4 for over 2.5 goals seem generous. All odds correct at time of writing. begambleaware.org",https://www.goal.com/en/news/morocco-vs-malawi-predictions-odds-and-betting-tips/blt08904d57268acad7,By Peter McVitie,55d6a3f1-02c7-4f4c-8917-2c5ebd1666c5
'World-class' Jota represents Liverpool's present and future,"It was the kind of touch Sadio Mane would have been proud of, and the sort of finish Mohamed Salah has made a career out of. That‚Äôs the company Diogo Jota keeps these days, though. The Liverpool fans in the away end at the Emirates were comparing him to the great Luis Figo on Thursday night, and no wonder.¬† When the Reds needed a hero, it was their Portuguese prince who donned his cape, pulled on his mask and sent them to Wembley. What a player. What a signing. They‚Äôve made a few good ones in recent years, have Liverpool, and how they‚Äôd love a few more like Jota going forward.  At 25 years of age, he represents both an exciting present and a glittering future for the men from Anfield. ‚ÄúDiogo‚Äôs on fire,‚Äù grinned Jurgen Klopp after Jota‚Äôs double had downed Arsenal in the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi final.¬† ‚ÄúHe is a world-class player in possibly the best form he‚Äôs found himself in at the club so far,‚Äù added Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose passes had created both goals.¬† That‚Äôs 14 in all competitions for Jota this season, surpassing his 2020-21 total.  If eyebrows were raised when Liverpool agreed to pay Wolves up to ¬£45 million ($61m) for his signature, then they have swiftly been lowered since. It looks a bargain. ‚ÄúWe knew we were signing a good player,‚Äù said Klopp. ‚ÄúBut since he is in, he made another step.‚Äù Later, he would echo Alexander-Arnold‚Äôs 'world-class' description. How Liverpool need him. With Salah and Mane away representing their countries at the Africa Cup of Nations, it is Jota who can hold the Reds together. It is Jota who can make the difference. For weeks we have wondered if the likes of Divock Origi and Takumi Minamino could step up, but the answers came at Arsenal.  Origi was sidelined, injured until at least the middle of next month, while Minamino was benched, Klopp preferring to start 17-year-old Kaide Gordon in what was only his fourth professional appearance.¬† The Japan international, sadly, looks like he‚Äôll never become the player Liverpool thought they were signing from Salzburg in January 2020.  He looked a smart pick-up at a little over ¬£7m ($9.5m), and he‚Äôs had his moments since, but he just lacks that something you need to play in a Klopp side on a regular basis. He will be sold in the summer, one suspects. Not Jota. It was he who set the Reds on their way, 19 minutes in, a driving run from the left sending Takehiro Tomiyasu tumbling and leaving Ben White and Aaron Ramsdale embarrassed.  A nerve-settler, if ever there was one, after a sloppy start from the visitors. He was a menace thereafter, skinning White down the left to create a golden chance which Gordon really should have taken after half-time. The youngster‚Äôs eyes would have lit up, but his time in a red shirt will come, for sure.¬† It didn‚Äôt cost his side, in any case. Thirteen minutes from time, Jota timed his run to perfection to take Alexander-Arnold‚Äôs gorgeous pass on his chest and lift the ball over Ramsdale.  An offside flag cut short the initial celebrations, but VAR afforded him another chance. The let-off in the away end was something to behold. ‚ÄúMentality and quality were the reasons we signed Diogo,‚Äù said Klopp. ‚ÄúHe has shown that for us. He is incredibly important.‚Äù He has, for sure, usurped Firmino as the third prong of Liverpool‚Äôs attack. His aggression, his movement and his ability to press and to take up killer positions is everything Klopp wants, and everything his side needs.¬† And when you add the goals into the equation too, then what more could a manager want? The reality is that Liverpool are going to have to evolve their team and their squad, this summer and beyond. Salah‚Äôs contract should be a priority, and they‚Äôd be foolish not to sort out Mane‚Äôs as well, if we‚Äôre being honest. Beyond that, a midfielder is needed and at least one attacker too. If they‚Äôre half as good as Jota has turned out to be, then Klopp really will be smiling.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/world-class-jota-represents-liverpool-s-present-and-future/blta282327b50042d0f,Neil Jones,153b27a6-75fe-4b9c-a9fa-41305e28f74e
Lisandro Martinez takes Pogba's No.6 while Eriksen claims No.14 as Man Utd reveal new signings' shirt numbers,"Manchester United have revealed that summer signing Lisandro Martinez has inherited the No.6 shirt from the departed Paul Pogba, while Christian Eriksen will wear No.14 next season. The Argentine is the latest big-money addition at Old Trafford, having made a ¬£46.5 million ($56m) transfer as Erik ten Hag drafted in a familiar face that he has previously worked with at Ajax. Martinez faces plenty of competition for places with the Red Devils from the likes of Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly, but he has been handed a prominent spot in their squad ahead of the 2022-23 Premier League campaign.

Introducing our new no.6 üî•üá¶üá∑ @LisandrMartinez#MUFC Enigmatic France international Pogba was the last man to wear No.6 for the Red Devils, having held the number over six seasons. Prior to that, Northern Irish defender defender Jonny Evans occupied that spot in United‚Äôs squad for four seasons. Portuguese winger Nani briefly donned six on his back in 2007-08, with the eight years prior to that seeing home-grown defender Wes Brown take that berth in Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äôs plans. Rio Ferdinand spent his first season at Old Trafford wearing No.6 in 2002-03, with Laurent Blanc passing it on at the end of his distinguished career. Another destructive centre-half, Dutch star Jaap Stam, had it immediately prior to a classy French star and was the man to grace the No.6 jersey during United's historic treble-winning campaign of 1998-99.

Having conceded a brace before the break, the visitors fought back after Raul Jimenez's dismissal, with finishes for Jack Harrison and Rodrigo tying things up before Ayling netted in stoppage time to put Jesse Marsch's men over the top. It marked the second game on the trot where Leeds seized victory in dramatic injury-time circumstances, having been forced to battle for a win against Norwich last time out - and their winning defender even attempted to replicate Robbie Keane's old club celebration too.

'Mane was unbelievable' - Thiago lauds Liverpool teammate after Manchester City heroics,"Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara has lauded winger Sadio Mane for his impact in the 3-2 win over Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final staged at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. Ibrahima Konate opened the scoring for Jurgen Klopp's charges before Mane scored his goals in the 17th and 45minutes. Despite Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva getting the ball in the back of the net in favour of the Citizens, the Reds held on for victory and advanced to the final. Alcantara assisted Mane for his second goal and has now lauded his teammate for his performance which played a massive role in silencing Pep Guardiola's team. ""He [Mane] is a fighter with a lot of technique so he knows how to mix it up and to do what we need. He was unbelievable,"" the Spain midfielder told the club's official portal. The 31-year-old then commented on the goals scored by his teammates. ""Yeah, it talks about us, it talks about our hunger when we have to press, like [Sadio Mane‚Äôs] goal, it talks about the players we have in terms of [Sadio Mane‚Äôs] second goal and also the great passers we have,"" he added. ""Our full-backs were amazing [on Saturday] as well."" Meanwhile, Manchester City manager Guardiola has refused to blame his goalkeeper Zack Steffen whose hesitancy to clear the ball led to Mane's first goal. ""It is an accident; Ederson was close in the last game as well. It happens. We need that for our football,"" the tactician told the club's website. ""Of course, you should review if it happens often but the way we use our keeper and move them in different situations, I‚Äôd say the average of the way we create from there, this can happen.   ""I‚Äôm pretty sure Zack didn‚Äôt want to do this. The strikers miss the chances in front of the keepers all the time.   ""Zack deserved to play and he made good decisions and good saves after that.

Mourinho reacts to question over becoming 'Roma's own Alex Ferguson',"Jose Mourinho has played down suggestions he could replicate Manchester United predecessor Alex Ferguson at Roma, and become the club's long-term supremo - though he added that he ""loves"" being at Stadio Olimpico. The veteran Portuguese boss has the chance to pick up silverware in his first season in charge next week when he takes his side to face Feyenoord in the maiden Europa Conference League final. Following his exit from Tottenham last term, the former Chelsea, Inter and Real Madrid manager looks to be getting back to his idiosyncratic best - but asked whether he could maintain a tenure like Ferguson's in Rome, his answer was less affirmative. ""Ferguson remained at [Man United] for more than 20 years,"" Mourinho told a press conference. ‚ÄúI should remain here until 79?! Maybe I could stay until I turn 70. ""I understand the question, I love being here and I think you can see that. I‚Äôve accepted a three-year project, let‚Äôs see what will happen then. I am not thinking about leaving before the end of my contract, but let‚Äôs see how the project shapes. ""Sometimes it‚Äôs similar to what one imagines, sometimes it‚Äôs different. The present is the only thing that matters in football and I want to stay here. That‚Äôs the best way to answer the question."" With the chance to add more silverware to his decorated cabinet looming, Mourinho could increase his honour haul in the managerial hot seat to an impressive 26 trophies across his career. That is by no means a poor feat - but it is a mark of Ferguson's dominance with United that the Portuguese does not even come close to the 38 honours won at Old Trafford alone by the Scotsman. That does not include the slate of major honours with Aberdeen before he joined the Red Devils, with Ferguson's collection of winners' medals as a manager exceeding virtually all others in the field.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-reacts-to-question-over-becoming-roma-s-own-alex/bltafe729246351cadb,Andrew Steel,818d58aa-3064-4b6c-9454-f68dbbe2fd3e

The Frenchman scored an incredible hat-trick as Madrid came from behind in the Bernabeu, having already been one down from the first leg, to book their place in the last eight of the competition.

From then on it was all about Benzema and Madrid.

Will Benzema play for Real Madrid vs PSG in Champions League last-16 tie?,"Will Karim Benzema play for Real Madrid against PSG in their Champions League last-16 tie? GOAL is here with everything you need to know. Benzema has been Madrid's main source of goals once again in 2021-22 as Carlo Ancelotti's side have risen to the top of La Liga and progressed to the Champions League knockout stages. The France international has hit 24 goals in 28 appearances, including five in Europe's elite competition, but the Blancos are sweating on his fitness ahead of their round of 16 first-leg meeting with PSG. Benzema has been out of action since being forced to come off with a hamstring complaint during Madrid's 2-2 La Liga draw with Elche on January 23. Ancelotti rested the 34-year-old for a subsequent Copa del Rey clash against Athletic Club, with the Blancos initially confident that the issue wasn't a serious one, but Benzema was also absent for their 1-0 win over Granada on Sunday. Benzema returned to training on the morning of February 9 in a solo session away from the rest of the first-team squad, and on Friday GOAL confirmed the striker was back in full training and would face PSG. It was agreed with the Madrid medical staff that Benzema could resume full training, and Ancelotti confirmed that the player is availble for selection against PSG. However he will go into that match having not played for three weeks, as he will not be risked for the weekend's Liga match against Villarreal, meaning it is touch and go whether he will play 90 minutes against PSG. Benzema took to Instagram to give supporters an update on his recovery on Thursday as he posted a video in high spirits while working on drills in the gym. PSG are set to welcome Madrid to Parc des Princes on February 15, meaning Benzema faces a race against time with his recovery. The Frenchman is also being trusted to make an honest assessment on whether he should be included in Madrid's travelling party to Paris. Ancelotti addressed Benzema's fitness before Madrid's home win against Granada, admitting he is not yet ""100 per cent"". The Italian head coach also acknowledged that his team are weaker without their chief goal-getter, but he remains confident that they have enough additional firepower in his absence. ""Of course we're missing Benzema, he's the top scorer in the league, scoring lots of goals this season for Real Madrid,"" Ancelotti said. ""I think you look at teams and their Benzemas [star player], if they miss that player of course it's a big loss, it's a blow. ""Without Benzema it's tougher, but without Benzema we've won games. I think we've done well without Karim.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/will-benzema-play-for-real-madrid-vs-psg-in-champions-league/bltceb17c2695b3b770,James Westwood,ec3c004a-af11-4e63-a624-f5a2b1b61f32

Wales national anthem: Land of My Fathers lyrics in full and explained,"The playing of national anthems before any given event, or when much sought-after medals are being collected, is a time-honoured tradition that gets the heart racing and competitive juices pumping. Grown men can be reduced to tears while belting out a song that means so much to so many, with carefully crafted lyrics tying all of those that hail from a particular corner of the world together. In the case of Wales, there is something special about bonding over ‚ÄòHen Wlad Fy Nhadau‚Äô (Land of My Fathers), with GOAL taking a look at one of the more passionate tunes from the world of sport. When competing under a Great Britain banner at competitions such as the Olympic Games, those of Welsh heritage have to make do with ‚ÄòGod Save The Queen‚Äô being their anthem of choice ‚Äì as that ties all of the United Kingdom together. When heading out on their own though ‚Äì in football, rugby and the Commonwealth Games ‚Äì international representatives of Wales get to sing ‚ÄòLand of My Fathers‚Äô at great volume whenever an opportunity presents itself. A loyal fan base has been able to deliver renditions of that at the last two European Championships on a footballing stage, while the hope is that it will soon be gracing the World Cup finals as Gareth Bale and Co take aim at Qatar 2022. (In Welsh) Mae hen wlad fy nhadau yn annwyl i mi,Gwlad beirdd a chantorion, enwogion o fri;Ei gwrol ryfelwyr, gwladgarwyr tra mad,Dros ryddid collasant eu gwaed. (Chorus) Gwlad, gwlad, pleidiol wyf i‚Äôm gwlad.Tra m√¥r yn fur i‚Äôr bur hoff bau,O bydded i‚Äôr hen iaith barhau. (Second stanza)Hen Gymru fynyddig, paradwys y bardd,Pob dyffryn, pob clogwyn, i‚Äôm golwg sydd hardd;Trwy deimlad gwladgarol, mor swynol yw siEi nentydd, afonydd, i fi. (Chorus) (Third stanza)Os treisiodd y gelyn fy ngwlad tan ei droed,Mae hen iaith y Cymry mor fyw ag erioed,Ni luddiwyd yr awen gan erchyll law brad,Na thelyn berseiniol fy ngwlad. (Chorus)  (Translated into English) This land of my fathers is dear to me Land of poets and singers, and people of stature Her brave warriors, fine patriots Shed their blood for freedom (Chorus) Land! Land! I am true to my land!As long as the sea serves as a wall for this pure, dear landMay the language endure for ever. Old land of the mountains, paradise of the poets,Every valley, every cliff a beauty guards;Through love of my country, enchanting voices will beHer streams and rivers to me. (Chorus) Though the enemy have trampled my country underfoot,The old language of the Welsh knows no retreat,The spirit is not hindered by the treacherous handNor silenced the sweet harp of my land. (Chorus) The words to ‚ÄòLand of My Fathers‚Äô were written by esteemed poet Evan James in 1856, while the tune was composed by his son, James. It was originally known as ‚ÄòGlan Rhondda‚Äô (Banks of the Rhondda), with the popularity of the song gradually increasing from 1858. The first recorded rendition of ‚ÄòLand of My Fathers‚Äô being used as a national anthem by Wales ahead of a sporting fixture came in 1905 ahead of the country‚Äôs rugby team facing a touring side from New Zealand. Fans continued to sing it from the stands on a regular basis after that, but the Welsh football team continued to use ‚ÄôGod Save The Prince of Wales‚Äô or ‚ÄòGod Save The Queen‚Äô until sporting bodies decided in 1975 that ‚ÄòHen Wlad Fy Nhadau‚Äô should be sung alone. Many petitions to make the song the official national anthem of Wales have been submitted down the years, but none have ever been passed. It could, however, get an outing in the Middle East later this year as, having failed to reach a World Cup since 1958, a side working under the management of caretaker coach Rob Page have booked a place in the play-off finals of the UEFA qualification section.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wales-national-anthem-land-of-my-fathers-lyrics-full/blt45796b4dc66b0c03,Chris Burton,e0f81bf6-2176-4cca-b1a8-4885a1eb11e8
Sarri hopes 'English fans will get VAR abolished' after Lazio exit Europa League,"Maurizio Sarri has said he hopes English football fans would be able to remove VAR from the game after Lazio were knocked out of the UEFA Europa League by Porto. The Serie A club drew 2-2 with their Portuguese visitors, resulting in a 4-3 aggregate exit from European competition for this season, despite having seized an early lead through Ciro Immobile. A subsequent penalty call against Sergej Milinkovic-Savic by referee Deniz Aytekin allowed Porto to regain their foothold, despite Porto forward Mehdi Taremi initially being booked for simulation. ""The equalizer goal is unlucky,"" the former Chelsea and Juventus boss told DAZN. ""The referee's first feeling is the right one, the VAR showed him a freeze-frame: a freeze-frame on a contact is always a penalty, but the situation was different.

Liverpool goalkeeper Kelleher escapes red card after VAR check but should he have been sent off during Cardiff City FA Cup clash?,"Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher escaped a red card following a VAR check after charging out of his area and fouling Cardiff City forward Mark Harris during Sunday's FA Cup tie. Referee Andrew Madley deemed the foul only worthy of a yellow card, with VAR agreeing with his decision and ruling that a clear and obvious error wasn't made. There were, however, many that felt Kelleher should have seen the caution upgraded to a red card, with the Reds perhaps being fortunate not to have been left with 10 men. More VAR Drama Caoimhin Kelleher goes into the book but should the Liverpool 'keeper have been sent off?üèÜ #FACup | #ITVFootball | @EmiratesFACup pic.twitter.com/X8jiCXFHdw Liverpool were being held 0-0 by Cardiff when the crucial moment occurred in what could have been a game-changing scenario had the Reds' goalkeeper been sent off. The Championship side were doing well to thwart Jurgen Klopp's men and, early on in the second half, had a chance on the counterattack as Harris raced through. He was then hacked down by Kelleher, who was attempting to sweep up behind his defence, with replays showing that his studs made contact with his opponent's right leg. A yellow card was subsequently shown by referee Madley, with VAR checking the incident but deciding that a red card was not required. Indeed, Ibrahima Konate's position saved Kelleher, with the centre-back chasing back as the two players collided. ""Caoimhin Kelleher feared the worst, and he wasn‚Äôt alone. ""'I think he could be gone here,' tweeted Robbie Fowler, the Liverpool legend. His view will have been shared by plenty inside Anfield. He survived, just. ""Ibrahima Konate‚Äôs presence on the cover saved the Reds keeper, but his tackle on Mark Harris looked worse with each viewing. ""A rush of blood, and one which could have cost his side dear on a tricky afternoon. Cardiff will feel aggrieved, as they did in the first half when Konate bundled into Harris in the penalty area.

Disgraced ex-president Blatter slams 'rude and disrespectful' Infantino but insists FIFA is not corrupt or 'a mafia',"Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has taken a swipe at current incumbent Gianni Infantino, labelling him ""rude and disrespectful"". Infantino took over at the helm of world football's governing body in 2016 after Blatter was suspended and subsequently suspended from FIFA over payments to ex-UEFA chief Michel Platini. In December 2015, Blatter was suspended for eight years, later reduced to six, and then given a further six-year ban in March 2021. In November last year, it was confirmed that the pair will be charged with fraud and other offences by Swiss prosecutors. The 86-year-old says he discussed his situation with Infantino following his election as president, but was then snubbed by his compatriot.  ""I met Mr. Infantino.¬†I met twice after his election, in 2016,"" the Swiss told ABC.  ""I met him at my house, where he stopped by to discuss FIFA issues.¬† ""He told me that I gave him problems that were not solved when they suspended me from FIFA and he told me that we are going to fix it later in a second congress in Mexico.¬† ""And later, in that congress I did not receive any information.¬† ""Finally I asked the general secretary what happened to the president and his promise to solve my problems and the answer was that the current president and FIFA were not going to discuss directly with the former president, but only through the lawyers .¬† ""It was the only and the last information I received from that man.¬†I must say that he is rude.¬†It was disrespectful."" Asked if Infantino could be harmful to football, Blatter said: ""You cannot harm football because it is a universal game that will continue in the centuries to come.¬† ""But it is possible that his attitude could affect FIFA.¬†FIFA is made up of 213 associations and if any of them do not agree, they can intervene in the congresses.¬† ""Unfortunately we have not held conferences in recent years due to the coronavirus issue.¬†But I think that next year one will be organized.¬†It is the national associations that must intervene if they are not happy."" Two days before Blatter was re-elected FIFA president in 2015, a series of arrests were made¬†in relation to corruption charges, including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. Among those indicted were 14 current and former FIFA officials and associates following an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States. FIFA was criticised as being corrupt and a sort of mafia under Blatter, but the former president insists there is no systemic corruption going on at the governing body. ""FIFA doesn't.¬†But some people continue who naturally do not correspond to the 'fair play' of football,"" he added.¬† ""Those are individual people.¬†I don't know how many, but 10 or more FIFA members at the time, all from South and North America, were arrested in Switzerland, don't tell me why there, and were sent to the United States.¬† ""And some were punished for corruption.¬†But FIFA itself is not going to be punished for corruption or being a mafia.¬† ""FIFA is two million people who are in the whole world to participate in this game.¬†Naturally, of those people who make it up there are some individuals who are not so correct, but to say that FIFA is a corruption or a mafia is wrong.¬† ""That's not fair.¬†Neither mafia, nor corruption.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/disgraced-ex-president-blatter-slams-rude-and-disrespectful/bltc7cbe2bd3458716c,By Peter McVitie,856d5fe3-101c-46aa-a9e1-6212ce9ce09e

Amokachi: How Everton star subbed himself on and saved his career in FA Cup semi-final,"Nigeria legend Daniel Amokachi has explained how his astonishing decision to substitute himself for Everton against Tottenham Hotspur in a semi-final clash in the FA Cup in 1995 was a key moment in his career. The Super Eagle, who had joined the Toffees from Club Brugge in the same season, has remembered how he made Everton assistant coach Willie Donachie bring him on for the injured Paul Rideout without the knowledge of the then head coach Joe Royle. Amokachi then went on to amazingly score two goals in the game as they beat Spurs 4-1 to reach the final. ‚ÄúIt was meant to be because if I didn't score then it would probably have been my last game for Everton,‚Äù the 49-year-old said as quoted by BBC Sport Africa. ‚ÄúRideout got a knock and went down, and if you play the same position you jump off your feet and start warming up and getting ready. ‚ÄúHe got up but went down again. Everybody knew I was in very good shape and ready to go. I just went to Willie [Everton assistant manager Willie Donachie] and I told him ‚ÄòThe gaffer says you need me on.‚Äô ‚ÄúWhen you look back at the clip, you can see how furious Joe Royle was. He ran to the touchline, [saying] 'What are you guys doing?' I looked back at him - we had done it already. If you pull me back, we'll play with one less anyway. ‚ÄúTen minutes later - bang. And then another goal - bang - and Everton were in the final. Legendary moments like that keep your name in the limelight.‚Äù The substitution left many baffled and even Royle described it as one of the ‚Äúthe greatest substitutions I never made.‚Äù On what Royle told him at the end of the match, Amokachi said: ‚ÄúIt was the gaffer that went to the press conference and told the whole world about it. Then he came into the locker room and hugged me, gave me his hand, and said: ‚ÄúWell done, son, but never try that again.‚Äù Everton went on to lift the title as they beat Manchester United 1-0 in the final. During that game, Amokachi came off the bench when Everton were already ahead. ‚ÄúBeating the mighty Manchester United in the final, nobody saw it coming,‚Äù Amokachi remembers. ‚ÄúAnd we did it because of that character that Joe Royle brought into the team. It is a day I will never forget.‚Äù Amokachi played many international matches for Nigeria and was part of the team that participated in the 1994 and 1998 Fifa World Cups. They had famously won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations. He also helped the Super Eagles to win the Olympic gold medal in 1996, scoring in the final against Argentina.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/amokachi-how-everton-star-subbed-himself-on-and-saved-his-career-/blt05f9f0ccfc6ffb48,Dennis Mabuka,cd8c79e3-08d4-47d4-889c-cda9541a0e4a
Neymar injury history: PSG & Brazil star's enforced absences & how many games he has missed,"Neymar stunned the football world when making a record-breaking ‚Ç¨222 million (¬£200m/$262m) move to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2017, with the Brazilian forward bringing a four-year stint at La Liga giants Barcelona to a close. His signing was another show of intent from PSG, who have invested heavily in a collection of superstar performers intended to deliver Champions League glory to Parc des Princes, and the South American has delivered on the field. The 31-year-old has, however, taken in regular spells on the sidelines as well, with niggling knocks proving difficult to shake. How many games has he missed in total? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Neymar's injuries have meant that he has missed over 100 games for PSG since signing in 2017. The South American picked up the odd ailment through the opening months of his spell in France, but a debut campaign at PSG was brought to a premature conclusion in February 2018 by a broken metatarsal. A similar injury was suffered in January 2019, leading to several weeks on the treatment table, while hamstring trouble held him back in the 2019-20 campaign. Adductor issues have become unfortunately common since then, while ankle issues have been a persistent bane to the attacker. You can see Neymar's full PSG injury history in the table below.

Fresh from completing a stunning transfer from Camp Nou, Neymar made his bow for PSG against Guingamp on August 13, 2017. He opened his goal account for new employers on debut, before bagging a brace in a meeting with Toulouse in his second outing. Across 30 appearances in his first season, Neymar registered 28 goals in all competitions. His output has dipped on an annual basis in the seasons since, with the target found on 23 occasions in 2018-19 and on 19 occasions the following year. Neymar managed just 17 efforts in 2020-21 and mustered 13 in 2021-22. PSG are in the fortunate position of not having to rely on their Brazilian superstar for inspiration, with Kylian Mbappe becoming a talismanic presence. Lionel Messi was also reunited with his former Barca team-mate in France during the summer of 2021.

Watford provide injury updates on Nigeria's Troost-Ekong and Kalu ahead of Manchester City clash,"Watford have confirmed both Nigeria internationals William Troost-Ekong and Samuel Kalu are in contention after returning to training ahead of their visit to face Manchester City in a Premier League fixture on Saturday. The Hornets will travel to face the Citizens at the Etihad Stadium seeking to win and increase their chances of avoiding relegation at the end of the season. Ahead of the do-or-die fixture, they have provided an injury update on their first team players including the Nigerian duo, who missed their last outing against Brentford last Saturday. ‚ÄúDefender William Troost-Ekong has returned to full training ahead of Saturday‚Äôs trip to Manchester City, as he completes his recovery from a slight hamstring strain that kept him out of contention for the home clash against Brentford last time out,‚Äù Watford confirmed on their official website. ‚ÄúThe Nigeria captain has made 16 Premier League appearances so far this season, but hasn‚Äôt turned out for the Hornets since the 1-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur at Vicarage Road on New Year‚Äôs Day.‚Äù The statement continued: ‚ÄúCucho Hernandez remains sidelined with a hamstring injury and will definitely miss out this weekend, but Samuel Kalu [ankle] and Francisco Sierralta [calf] - who were also forced to miss the Brentford defeat with minor injuries - will both train today (April 21), albeit with modified sessions. ‚ÄúTwo other members of Roy Hodgson‚Äôs first-team squad are currently nursing knocks, and they will be assessed tomorrow [April 22)] before the team departs for the Etihad Stadium.‚Äù Since joining Watford from FC Girondins de Bordeaux in January, Kalu has appeared in two Premier League matches, with both of these appearances coming as a substitute. The last Premier League appearance that Kalu made came on March 10 for Watford against Wolverhampton Wanderers, a meeting that he played 45 minutes in during a 4-0 defeat. Meanwhile, Watford manager Roy Hodgson believes they will face a tough fixture against Man City. ‚ÄúEveryone knows what the situation is,‚Äù Hodgson said as quoted by the club website. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre going to do is try and make ourselves unpopular. ‚ÄúIf we want to make ourselves popular with Pep, the Man City crowd, and everyone else, all we do is go hell for leather and try to match them at their game, which is a recipe for disaster.

The Portugal international posted an image on his Instagram story showing a bruise on his right eye and a cut above his eyebrow. Cancelo, 27, said the culprits tried to harm his family and he fought back, though they took off with his jewellery. Cancelo posted: ""Unfortunately today I was assaulted by four cowards who hurt me and tried to hurt my family. When you show resistance, this is what happens.

""Joao and his family are being supported by the club and he is helping the police with their enquiries as they investigate this very serious matter."" The attack on Cancelo and his family comes just weeks after former Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi was attacked and robbed in his own home after returning from playing a match with Benfica. Plus, last month, Paris Saint-Germain player Kheira Hamraoui was pulled out of her team-mate's car and attacked after attending a club night out. Another high-profile incident which occurred this year was that of PSV striker Eran Zahavi, whose house was invaded while he was playing a match.

Amadou Onana: Senegal prospect powers Lille past Simon‚Äôs Nantes,"Lille secured a 1-0 away win over Nantes in Saturday‚Äôs Ligue 1 clash, with Amadou Onana the hero.¬† The Belgium youth international of Senegalese background scored the only goal for the Mastiffs as they extended their unbeaten league run to six matches. Following their 1-0 defeat to Troyes last time out, the Canaries welcomed Jocelyn Gourvennec‚Äôs men to Stade de la Beaujoire, as they targetted a return to winning ways. For Lille, who crashed out of the Champions League after losing to Chelsea during the week, an away result would boost their chances of playing a fourth consecutive campaign of continental football next term. In the thrilling fixture, Angel Gomes almost got Gourvennec‚Äôs side off to the perfect start with a speculative long-range shot that was pushed away by goalkeeper Alban Lafont. On the other side, Ludovic Blas forced goalkeeper Leo Jardim into a smart save down to his left-hand side after Randal Kolo Muani took advantage of some indecisive defending from Xeka.¬† Nevertheless, just as Nantes were gradually working their way into the clash, Lille took the lead through Onana with four minutes left into the first half break.¬† The 20-year-old reacted quickest on the rebound to slot the ball home after Jose Fonte‚Äôs initial header was saved by Lafont. That was his first goal in the French elite division since joining from German second-tier side Hamburg at the start of the 2021-22 campaign. The hosts suffered a slight setback shortly as injured Quentin Merlin was replaced by Fabio. Muani was presented with a chance to restore parity for Nantes after the restart, but he headed wide a cross from Moses Simon. The visitors‚Äô lead was threatened when referee Pierre Gaillouste sent¬†Timothy Weah packing for his dangerous challenge on Samuel Moutoussamy. The decision was upheld after VAR review. Pedro Chirivella nearly made that one-man advantage count, only to see his effort painfully hit both posts before rebounding to safety.¬† Onana was in action from start to finish as well as Cote d‚ÄôIvoire prospect Jonathan Bamba.¬† Nigeria international Simon was subbed off for Wylan Cyprien with three minutes left to play, while¬†Congolese midfielder Samuel Moutoussamy came off for Willem Geubbels in the 63rd minute.

Barcelona's Ter Stegen snubs Messi in best XI of team-mates across his career,"Marc-Andre ter Stegen has named his dream XI of current and former team-mates, and there is no place for Lionel Messi in the side. The goalkeeper's time with Borussia Monchengladbach, Barcelona and Germany has seen him play alongside many top stars. With a wide range of big names to choose from, Ter Stegen has listed a solid XI, but omitted the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner. Ter Stegen opted to line his team up in a 4-4-2 diamond formation and listed seven former or current Barcelona heroes. Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Frenkie de Jong were all given the nod. But the likes of Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were all snubbed by the 29-year-old. Meanwhile, goalkeeper Janis Blaswich, Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger and Germany team-mates Marco Reus and Mario Gotze were also named in the team. The full XI is: Blaswich; Alves, Pique, Rudiger, Alba; Busquets; Xavi, Iniesta; De Jong; Reus, Gotze. Ter Stegen did not mention his former team-mate when listing his team and did not explain why he did not make the cut. But the shot-stopper suggested that the pair did not always get along when he posted a farewell message on Instagram after it was confirmed Messi had left Camp Nou. He wrote in the caption: ""Although from time to time we did not share the same opinion, we always went in the same direction and each of us grew as a person regardless of winning or losing.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-ter-stegen-snubs-messi-best-xi-team-mates-across/blt63b27d491aa5db0f,By Peter McVitie,2c9c3d4e-914b-4249-8bfa-f9e654cab73c
Adama Traore 'had zero concept of time' with Barcelona star's former team-mate revealing late fines were scrapped,"Adama Traore has been accused of having ‚Äúzero concept of time‚Äù, with Stewart Downing revealing that Middlesbrough had to scrap fines for lateness during the Barcelona loanee‚Äôs time at the Riverside Stadium as they were taking so much money off him. A jet-heeled Spain international spent two years on Teesside between 2016 and 2018, taking in 27 Premier League appearances and a further 34 in the Championship. It was clear back then that La Masia academy graduate Traore had the potential to retrace his steps to Camp Nou at some stage, but he was a lost cause on the time-keeping front and would often come close to missing games as coaches threatened to leave without him. Boro legend Downing has told Ladbrokes of working with a player that re-joined Barca on loan from Wolves in the January transfer window: ‚ÄúOne player comes to mind straight away when I think of the biggest culprit for club fines: Adama Traore‚Ä¶ a great, great lad, but he had absolutely no sense of time. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt drive, and he lived right next to the training ground so he‚Äôd come to training on his little scooter, and he‚Äôd always be late. We‚Äôd all be travelling from 40 minutes or so away, he‚Äôs two minutes around the corner and he was always late. ‚ÄúOne time he went home for an afternoon nap and we were leaving on the coach for a game later on in the day. Garry Monk just told the driver to leave him, because he wasn‚Äôt waking up! ‚ÄúHe was a really good lad and we all tried to help him as much as we could ‚Äì we‚Äôd just be saying ‚ÄòAdama, come on‚Ä¶ just set your alarm on your phone‚Äô. ‚ÄúI think he just liked paying fines! He must‚Äôve just liked paying them. In the end it got too out of hand; we decided between us we just couldn‚Äôt take the amounts of money from him that he was having to pay us in fines. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt just keep fining him, it clearly wasn‚Äôt working, so we just had to literally drag him on the bus. He was a great lad, but he just had zero concept of time.‚Äù Traore left Middlesbrough for Wolves in 2018 and has taken in over 150 appearances for the West Midlands-based club. His searing pace made him a handful for opposition defenders, to the point that senior international recognition eventually came his way in October 2020. He was included in Spain‚Äôs squad for Euro 2020 and, after making no secret of a desire to return to his Catalan roots at some stage, linked up with Barcelona in the winter transfer window on a short-term loan agreement that includes the option for a permanent deal to be pushed through. A positive impression has been made back in La Liga, with two assists recorded through six appearances, but a team rejuvenated under the guidance of Xavi are being linked with several other big-name forwards heading towards the summer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/adama-traore-zero-concept-time-barcelona-former-team-mate/bltab1a6135f01a27cd,Chris Burton,624d1e24-f780-4c4d-b14c-8f6247ce959a
Neville calls Man Utd 'bunch of whingebags' as Ronaldo seen complaining to team-mates in Newcastle draw,"Gary Neville blasted Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 Premier League draw with Newcastle on Monday, calling the Red Devils a ""bunch of whingebags"" as Cristiano Ronaldo and company endured a frustrating night at St James' Park. Edinson Cavani's second-half finish cancelled out Allan Saint-Maximin's superb first-half strike to ensure Ralf Rangnick maintained his unbeaten start to life at the Red Devils, but the visitors found themselves often mired in post-Christmas lethargy following a two-week-plus Covid-19-enforced break from action. Another point-saving performance from David de Gea between the posts was the greatest highlight of an otherwise uninspired group showcase against their relegation-embattled hosts - and ex-United defender Neville did not pull his punches when dissecting their overall mentality. ""There's no pressing, there's no urgency,"" the former England right-back stated on Sky Sports at the interval. ""The basics of the game, every single battle, they've lost. That's been a really poor performance. ""There's not one single thing that's gone right as a team. There's not one single player who can go in at half-time and say that they've done their jobs, or even done themselves justice. ""They‚Äôre a bunch of whingebags. Watch them on that pitch. Arms in the air, complaining about everything. They got the last manager the sack [and] they‚Äôll get a lot of managers the sack, that lot, if they carry on like that."" Reflecting on his side's performance, Rangnick pointed to their inability to dominate the game on a physical level, adding that he was less than impressed with the overall game. ""Today was not a question of body language, it was a question of body physicality,"" he told Sky Sports. ""If you want to be competitive here you have to get physical and this was not the case in many parts of the game."" ""I didn't like the performance at all. Today we didn't control the game apart from a few moments. It's all about energy, physicality and who wins the second balls. In all those areas we weren't at our best. The good thing is we got a point but the performance needs to be better."" While his team-mate Cavani came off the bench to spare United's blushes in the second half, it proved to be a misfire of an evening for the Red Devils' star man up front. Ronaldo was seen frustratedly gesturing towards team-mates throughout the game, scenes that seemed to bother Neville. In addition, the Portuguese failed to deliver in front of goal when it came to efforts on target, with United managing just four to Newcastle's eight. With a draw on Tyneside, United remain seventh in the Premier League and trail rivals and table-toppers Manchester City by a whopping 19 points. With two games in hand over several of their rivals, however, they will know that they can still close the gap on fourth-place Arsenal, seven points ahead of them, with a good run of form into the new year.

'The fun got a bit lost' - Werner makes jibe at Tuchel's Chelsea system after sealing Leipzig return,"Timo Werner has claimed that Thomas Tuchel's preferred Chelsea system did not suit him while admitting ""the fun got a bit lost"" towards the end of his time in west London. Werner departed Stamford Bridge on August 9, returning to former club RB Leipzig in a ‚Ç¨30 million (¬£25.2m/$30.5m) deal.   The German failed to reach the heights of his Bundesliga career at Chelsea, managing just 23 goals in 89 games.  However, he did help the Blues win the Champions League in 2021, playing just over an hour in the final against Manchester City.  Werner has now explained why he decided to re-trace his steps and bring the curtain down on his two-year stint at Stamford Bridge. ‚ÄúFor me, the fun of playing football is in the foreground,‚Äù he told the Einfach mal Luppen podcast.  ‚ÄúOf course, I had great success at Chelsea, but the fun got a bit lost in the end because I didn‚Äôt play regularly anymore.  ‚ÄúI think the coach‚Äôs system of play didn‚Äôt suit me perfectly. That‚Äôs why it was clear to me that I wanted to take a new step. I‚Äôm at an age where I want to play as much as I can.  ‚ÄúI really associate very great successes with Chelsea ‚Äì the greatest of my career. It will always be a special club for me.

'We‚Äôre not robots' ‚Äì Rudiger explains why new Chelsea contract didn‚Äôt happen as he prepares to join Real Madrid,"Antonio Rudiger has lifted the lid on why no new contract was agreed at Chelsea, with the German defender preparing to link up with Real Madrid as a free agent this summer. The 29-year-old centre-half is bidding farewell to Stamford Bridge after five seasons, making more than 200 appearances alongside FA Cup, Europa League, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup honours. He has been a talismanic presence for the Blues at times, but no extension to his spell in west London has been agreed and a new challenge at the Liga heavyweights will be taken on from 2022-23. Rudiger told The Players‚Äô Tribune why no agreement was reached: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, my contract negotiations had already started to get difficult last fall. ‚ÄúBusiness is business, but when you don‚Äôt hear any news from the club from August to January, the situation becomes complicated. ‚ÄúAfter the first offer, there was a long gap of just nothing. We‚Äôre not robots, you know? You cannot wait for months with so much uncertainty about your future. ‚ÄúObviously, no one saw the sanctions coming, but in the end, other big clubs were showing interest, and I had to make a decision. I will leave it at that, because business aside, I have nothing bad to say about this club. ‚ÄúChelsea will always be in my heart. London will always be my home. ‚ÄúI came here alone, and now I have a wife and two beautiful kids. I also have a new brother for life named Kova. I have an FA Cup, a Europa League and a Champions League medal. Of course, I have hundreds of memories that will stay with me forever. ‚ÄúI leave this club with a heavy heart.

That is preventing the club from discussing any new contracts or readying moves for fresh faces in the summer transfer window. Plenty of movement is expected, with a consortium headed up by Todd Boehly poised to take control at Stamford Bridge, but there could be as many departures as arrivals. Rudiger‚Äôs exit has already been confirmed, with fellow defender Andreas Christensen another of those heading towards free agency as the Denmark international continues to be linked with Barcelona.

Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes avoids serious injury in car crash ahead of Liverpool match,"Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes was involved in a car crash on Monday but has managed to avoid serious injury. The midfielder was able to train with his team-mates despite the incident involving his Porsche.

Afcon 2021: Burkina Faso's record won't count against Tunisia ‚Äì Malo,"Burkina Faso coach Kamou Malo has laughed off claims they are the favourites heading into their Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final clash against Tunisia at Roumde Adjia Stadium on Saturday. The Stallions will head into the fixture armed with history as they have beaten the Carthage Eagles in the previous two quarter-final matches - (8-7 on penalties at home in 1998 and 2-0 in the 2017 edition in Gabon. Ahead of their third meeting, Burkinable‚Äôs Malo believes history will not count and his players will not think about the past, but the present ‚Äúwhich is always important.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe next match is qualifying for the semi-finals, so it is very difficult. We have determination to continue the journey and feel the responsibility,‚Äù Malo said as quoted by CafOnline. ‚ÄúOur players are young and have the enthusiasm to win and continue their way. Tunisia is a good and cohesive team, but our side is armed with spirit and determination. ‚ÄúThe game will not be played on paper, but on the field. We don't think about the past, but the present is always more important. We have a young ambitious team, and we can write our present and future.‚Äù Burkina Faso midfielder Adama Guira has described their meeting against the North African side as a final. ‚ÄúWe are delighted to be in the quarter-finals, and we can't wait for the match which will be a final.

We have young players, but they are playing at the highest levels in Europe. ‚ÄúThe team is well prepared, and we are among the best in the tournament. We keep improving game after game.‚Äù Meanwhile, Tunisia assistant coach Jalel Kadri has said they will treat Burkina Faso as the strongest candidates for the title. ‚ÄúMost of the teams that were candidates to play the quarter-finals are no longer here, and this indicates the strength of the competition.

"Boehly-led consortium set to become Chelsea owners, but Jim Ratcliffe not ruled out","Chelsea have decided that a Todd Boehly-led group of investors is the preferred bidder to take over the club from owner Roman Abramovich, subject to approval from both the Premier League and the United Kingdom government. Boehly, who co-owns the Los Angeles Dodgers in the United States, is now set to become the Blues' owner with voting rights split among other investors, and he sees his bid 66 per cent backed by Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm.¬† Still, the club, which is expected to fetch a world record-breaking fee for a sports team after a bidding war between various parties, could yet see another entity such as Jim Ratcliffe win out - though GOAL understands that's unlikely at this stage. Boehly runs 60 per cent of the $6 billion valued investment firm Eldridge Industries from which he runs most of his investments, except for the Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers which are private investments. In 2019, Boehly had a ¬£2.2 billion bid rejected by Abramovich for Chelsea. He followed that up with an interview in Bloomberg where he stated his interest in getting involved in Premier League football. ‚ÄúFootball is the biggest sport in the world,‚Äù Boehly insisted. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe American football can get to use the word ‚Äòfootball‚Äô because to me that word should be football. The fact is it is still the best product in the world. It‚Äôs 90 minutes so it has a great timeline. The passion that the fans have for the activity and the sport and the teams is unparalleled. So when you start to think about what you‚Äôre trying to build with these teams is, you‚Äôre really trying to A, win and B, be part of the community.‚Äù One of his investments is in Fortnite, the supremely popular video game. He is estimated to have a personal net worth ¬£3.3 billion ($4.4bn). His last-minute ¬£4.25 billion bid (which comprises a ¬£1.75 billion investment over 10 years, plus ¬£2.5 billion to a ""charitable trust"" likely to be related to the war in Ukraine) came as a surprise late in the process on Friday morning. It changes the landscape of the process which is run by New York investment bank Raine Group. It's unclear whether the bid will be allowed as the process has been designed to narrow down the options and it has missed several deadlines. A statement read: ""Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for ¬£4.25bn. ¬£2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with ¬£1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. ""This is a British bid, for a British club. ""We believe that a club is bigger than its owners who are temporary custodians of a great tradition. With responsibility to the fans and the community. ""That is why we are committing to spending ¬£1.75bn over 10 years that will be for the direct benefit of the club. ""We will invest in Stamford Bridge to make it a world-class stadium, befitting of Chelsea FC. This will be organic and on-going so that we will not move away from the home of Chelsea and risk losing the support of loyal fans. ""We will continue to invest in the team to ensure we have a first class squad of the world‚Äôs greatest players, coaches and support staff, in the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs games. ""And we hope to continue to invest in the academy to provide opportunity for talented youngsters to develop into first class players. ""We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city. One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club. ""We are making this investment as fans of the beautiful game ‚Äì not as a means to turn a profit. We do that with our core businesses. The club is rooted in its community and its fans. And it is our intention to invest in Chelsea FC for that reason. ""No further comment will be made from Sir Jim or INEOS during the bidding process."" The private equity firm Clearlake Capital is thought to be stumping up around 50 per cent of the bid to buy Chelsea. Alongside him is his long-term business partner Hansjorg Wyss, the Swiss billionaire who first announced that Abramovich was selling Chelsea. The Dodgers' principle owner Mark Walter is part of the group alongside British investor Jonathan Goldstein. Advising the bid are prominent Chelsea supporters Danny Finkelstein, who is a conservative member of the House of Lords, and Barbara Charone, who is a marketing executive. The Chelsea supporting former British politican George Osborne is advising the bid through his firm Robey Warshaw, with Goldman Sachs also working in an advisory role. Any prospective bidder has been asked to guarantee a minimum of ¬£1 billion further investment over 10 years which would go towards the stadium, women's and academy teams. Along with the costs of buying the club, it would raise the overall financial commitment of the project to between ¬£3.5 billion and ¬£4 billion. Like the other potential options, the new Blues owners have promised investment into all areas of the club and to work on the stadium.¬† Architects Jane Marie Smith and David Hickey, the latter who is the former project director for Abramovich‚Äôs now-cancelled 60,000-seat redevelopment, are being consulted about reviving plans for Stamford Bridge.¬† The Premier League will conduct an owners and directors test on the group that is expected to take roughly two weeks.¬† Once they've gained approval, the UK government will handle the money from the sale and issue an operating licence that frees up the club from the restrictions of sanctions.¬† It will allow Chelsea to renew contracts, make signings and sell players - along with running their club shop and selling tickets to new customers for matches.¬† It will also cut out Abramovich from the club and end a 19-year ownership period that saw the Blues win 21 trophies.¬† The money will be frozen or given to charity with that stage yet to be fully thrashed out.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/boehly-led-ownership-consortium-now-preferred-chelsea-bidder-but-/blt30c8d1ac1dfd9786,Nizaar Kinsella,4054651e-eecb-45de-b4b6-a170a17f0fb4

UEFA allows clubs to register two additional players for European competitions as a result of Russia-Ukraine crisis,"European clubs have been granted permission to register two more players - signed from Russian or Ukrainian clubs - to their squads for UEFA competitions. The governing body announced the new regulations on Monday, setting a deadline of April 1 for new players to be registered. The change comes after FIFA suspended the contracts of foreign players at Ukrainian and Russian clubs for the remainder of the 2021-22 season. Any players snapped up by other teams across Europe can now be added to Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League squads. A statement on the organisation's website read: ""The UEFA Executive Committee today decided to amend the regulations of the 2021/22 UEFA Champions League, 2021/22 UEFA Europa League and 2021/22 UEFA Europa Conference League regulations, and to allow clubs to register a maximum of two new eligible players for the remaining matches in the current competitions by 1 April 2022 (24:00 CET) at the latest. ""Furthermore, the UEFA Executive Committee approved similar amendments to the 2021/22 UEFA Women‚Äôs Champions League regulations, to allow clubs to register a maximum of two new eligible players for the remaining matches in the current competition by 7 April 2022 (24:00 CET) at the latest, in line with the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfers of Players."" The statement continued: ""In this regard, the UEFA Executive Committee decided to include a provision permitting clubs to register a maximum of two additional players, which were previously registered with a club affiliated to the UAF or the FUR and whose contracts have been suspended in accordance with Annex 7 of the FIFA RSTP. ""To be eligible to participate in the abovementioned UEFA competitions, any such new player shall, among others, be duly registered with the national association as playing for the club concerned in accordance with the associations‚Äô own rules and those of FIFA."" The changes to the regulations come in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As well as the suspension of foreign players' contracts, Russian clubs have been banished from UEFA competitions, while the national team has been suspended by FIFA. The country appealed against the suspension from the 2022 World Cup qualifying play-offs this month, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected their plea.

The Hornets, who were relegated from the top-flight after losing 1-0 to Crystal Palace in their last top-flight assignment, will welcome the Toffees at Vicarage Road on Wednesday in their third-last match of the season. However, the 74-year-old former England manager has outlined multiple potential absentees while delivering team news for the fixture with Nigeria‚Äôs Dennis and Senegal‚Äôs Sarr among those affected. ‚ÄúWith [Tom] Cleverley, it‚Äôs the injury he received in the game, with [Emmanuel] Dennis and [Ismaila] Sarr it‚Äôs a knee problem that they‚Äôve reported which has ruled them out, and with [Joshua] King and [Kiko] Femenia, it‚Äôs sickness. We were hoping it would pass but it hasn‚Äôt yet,‚Äù Hodgson said as quoted by the club‚Äôs official website. ‚Äú[Juraj] Kucka missed the last game due to a knee problem and will miss the next one for the same problem.‚Äù Hodgson has further confirmed the absence of Cameroon defender Nicolas Nkoulou. ‚ÄúOne has been injured for the last couple of weeks, [Imran] Louza,‚Äù Hodgson continued. ‚Äú[Nicolas] Nkoulou is now injured, Shaq Forde, a young forward we like, has turned his ankle over in training, and other players that were involved at the weekend. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping [Joao Pedro] will be okay. He trained, it‚Äôs the first time he has trained but we will be hoping on him. We will have a team consisting of the senior players at the club, who are fit, and I won‚Äôt really be having to leave anybody from the senior group out of the team because they‚Äôll be needed on the pitch.‚Äù The former Palace manager is confident the injury crisis will give other players in the squad a chance to come in and make their case. ‚ÄúI was hoping to play a similar team, but we‚Äôve lost so many players that we find ourselves in the middle of an injury crisis.

Milan in talks to sign Douglas Luiz with Aston Villa set to negotiate on ‚Ç¨30m asking price,"Milan are in talks to sign Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz, GOAL can confirm, with the Premier League club set to negotiate on their reported ‚Ç¨30 million (¬£26m/$31m) asking price. Luiz has spent the last three years of his career at Villa, having initially been brought in from Manchester City in July 2019. The Brazilian has established himself as a key member of the first-team squad at Villa Park, but he only has one year left on his contract and the summer window represents the club's last chance to cash in. GOAL understands Milan are holding direct talks with Villa over a potential summer deal for Luiz. The 24-year-old's entourage believe that there is a strong chance of an agreement being reached this summer, but if not, the possibility of a free transfer could also be discussed in January. It has been reported that Villa would prefer to receive a fee for Luiz and will consider lowering their valuation of the player to push a deal over the line. Should Luiz arrive at San Siro before the transfer market closes, he is unlikely to be the only new addition to Stefano Pioli's midfield ranks. GOAL has learned that Milan are also working on a deal for Lille playmaker Renato Sanches, who has been lined up as a replacement for Franck Kessie. The Rossoneri are also looking at strengthening slightly higher up the pitch, with Chelsea's Hakim Ziyech and Argentina international Paulo Dybala on their reported list of targets.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/milan-douglas-luiz-aston-villa-asking-price/blt0626632860fdfd77,GOAL,7d5cb27b-44d6-4f62-a6b2-ad2c218ff1bf
The day La Liga took on Man City & PSG: Spanish league files extraordinary transfer complaint to UEFA,"La Liga has filed complaints against Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City to UEFA for ""continuously breaching"" financial fair play regulations. The Spanish top-flight revealed that an initial complaint was made against the Premier League team in April, but has been followed up with another about the French giants. La Liga argues that the two teams' ""irregular financing"" and big spending violates UEFA's rules and affects all European leagues and clubs. The league also cited a conflict of interests regarding PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, given his role as European Club Association (ECA) chairman and his role as the organisation's delegate to UEFA's executive committee.  The statement read: ""LaLiga this week filed a complaint with UEFA against PSG, which will join another against Manchester City in April, for understanding that these clubs are continuously breaching the current financial fair play regulations. ""LaLiga considers that these practices alter the ecosystem and the sustainability of football, harm all European clubs and leagues, and only serve to artificially inflate the market, with money not generated in football itself. ""LaLiga understands that the irregular financing of these clubs is carried out, either through direct injections of money or through sponsorship and other contracts that do not correspond to market conditions or make economic sense. ""The complaints against Manchester City before UEFA were made in April and this last week the one corresponding to PSG has been presented, although it is not ruled out that in the coming days extensions of some of these complaints will be made with the contributions of new data. ""Additionally, LaLiga has contracted law firms in France and Switzerland, including the French firm of lawyer Juan Branco, with the aim of undertaking administrative and judicial actions before the competent French bodies and before the European Union as soon as possible. ""In Switzerland, LaLiga is studying different representation options due to possible conflicts of interest of Nasser Al-Khela√Øfi derived from his different roles in PSG, UEFA, ECA and BeIN Sports."" The Spanish league's appeal to UEFA comes in the wake of Erling Haaland's transfer to City and Kylian Mbappe's contract extension at PSG.  Mbappe had long been expected to join Real Madrid and the striker's mother said he had an agreement in place with the European champions. However, he ended up committing to a three-year contract with the French club, much to the ire of Madrid and La Liga, which vowed to pursue legal action and file complaints to UEFA and the European Union.  Haaland, too, had been linked with a move to La Liga as Madrid and Barcelona had both been after him. However, he ended up agreeing to join City in a deal worth ¬£51 million ($63m) from Borussia Dortmund. UEFA implemented the financial fair play rules to stop clubs spending more money than they earn and putting themselves in trouble. City and PSG have both been the subject of investigations for allegedly violating the regulations. UEFA initially banned the English team from European competitions due to ""serious breaches"", but the club appealed the punishment and it was subsequently overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In 2014, both PSG and City were sanctioned by European football's governing body in the form of fines and restrictions on transfer spending.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/la-liga-man-city-psg-spanish-league-files-extraordinary-transfer-/blt9f62ceffd63aa6e6,Peter McVitie,6397f3dc-37c6-4a41-8ee2-74f557fae047
Manchester City release 2022-23 third kit inspired by street art,"In contrast to their classic sky blue home shirt and red/black away kit, Man City has opted for a neon green third kit to give their shirt collection a bright new lease of life for the season. PUMA has launched it with the slogan 'play forever', as the shirt pays homage to a different form of play associated with Manchester¬†- street art. The lime green main body is contrasted with black hoops that blur at the edges, which pay tribute to the Manchester worker bee.

"'What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!' - Barcelona president Laporta trolls Real Madrid with huge electronic banner","FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta has sent a message to arch-rivals Real Madrid ahead of the first ""El Clasico"" of the season. The Spanish giants are all set to face each other in a pre-season friendly on Sunday at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. In the buildup to the Clasico, Joan Laporta's campaign manager Lluis Carrasco unveiled an advertisement on a huge electronic banner which read, ""Don‚Äôt worry Merengues, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.""  Laporta was likely reminding Real Madrid of the 4-0 thrashing that Xavi's side handed them last season at the Santiago Bernabeu.  Bon dia, Catalunya!       ‚Äî El Bar√ßa a Las Vegas pic.twitter.com/HLY86gkVDC Carrasco pulled off a similar advertising stunt during Barcelona's presidential election in 2021. A slogan was hung outside Santiago Bernabeu which read, ‚ÄúLooking forward to seeing you again.‚Äù The slogan is believed to have boosted Laporta's bid to return to power at the Catalan club.  Barcelona have already completed the signings of Raphinha, Andreas Christensen, Franck Kessie and Robert Lewandowski, but they are not done yet. Barcelona have been eyeing a move for Sevilla defender Jules Kounde and could still make a late bid to sign him, even though Chelsea are close to an agreement.  The Camp Nou side are lining up several other options to strengthen their defence should they miss out on Kounde, however. According to reports, they also have their sights set on Villarreal centre-back Pau Torres, Arsenal's William Saliba, Inter star Milan Skriniar, Josko Gvardiol of RB Leipzig, Athletic Club's Inigo Martinez and Roma defender Roger Ibanez.  Indeed, fortifying the defence is Barca's priority now, having already secured the likes of Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski to strengthen the attack. Barcelona have played two friendly matches so far in the pre-season. In their first match, they were held to a 1-1 draw by Catalonian club Olot.  Barcelona, in their first match of the U.S tour, thrashed Inter Miami 6-0. New recruit Raphinha alongside Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Gavi, Ansu Fati, Memphis Depay and Ousmane Dembele were on target for the LaLiga giants.  Real Madrid, on the other hand, will kick-off their pre-season with the ""El Clasico"" on Sunday.

Man Utd situation made Martial lose his joy for football,"Anthony Martial says that he lost ""a little bit"" of his love for football during his time with Manchester United, with the Frenchman suggesting he feels reborn on loan at Sevilla. The Red Devils attacker made a short-term switch to La Liga in the January transfer window after struggling to hold down a place under former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer across the first half of last season. Now, the forward has spoken about his dissatisfaction with life at Old Trafford, while revealing that he was always set on forcing a move elsewhere in the new year. ""For me, it was the best option to play and enjoy football again,"" Martial stated, as quoted by the Daily Mail. ""I lost it a little bit in Manchester because I was not playing. ""I feel very good in Sevilla. The city is very good and we are a good team so, for me, it's perfect. I'm playing so I'm happy. But I'm here just until the end of the season and that's it. ""I asked United to leave because I wanted to play. I still have a contract but they know what I want, so we will see at the end of the season. When [Ralf Rangnick] arrived, my objective was to leave. I told him I wanted to leave. I wanted to have a new atmosphere and a new club."" Martial's future will be assessed again in the summer, with it not being clear if he'll continue at Sevilla, seek a move elsewhere or stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford. Before that, however, he'll be hoping to help the Spanish side into the next stage of the Europa League, with Sevilla facing West Ham in the last 16 second leg on March 17. Manchester United, meanwhile, also face an uncertain summer. The Red Devils have failed to secure silverware in the 2021-22 campaign after being dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid, while their top-four prospects are anything but secure. Indeed, the club will need to press on with the appointment of a new manager in the summer, with Ralf Rangnick due to vacate his interim role.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-situation-martial-lose-joy-football/blt59406a3fc23ec576,Andrew Steel,94a69d27-9fde-4a5b-9ae5-0d38401007a1
Obi-less Salernitana climb out of Serie A relegation zone after defeating Okereke‚Äôs Venezia,"Salernitana have moved out of the Serie A relegation zone after subduing Venezia 2-1 in Thursday‚Äôs Italian elite division encounter. Unbeaten in their last four league matches, the Garnets welcomed Andrea Soncin‚Äôs men to the Stadio Arechi as they continued their battle demotion to Serie B. They did not disappoint as they secured all points at stake thanks to goals from Federico Bonazzoli and Simone Verdi in the keenly contested fixture. The hosts got off to a brilliant start and got a seventh-minute penalty after Pietro Ceccaroni handled the ball in the dangerous area. Following a VAR check, referee Maurizio Mariani pointed to the penalty spot with Bonazzoli drilling the ensuing kick past goalkeeper Niki Maenpaa. Salernitana were inches away from doubling their advantage shortly after the half-hour mark but Maenpaa denied Ivan Radovanovic. In dire need of a positive outcome, Venezia stepped up their performance in the second half to level matters through Thomas Henry in the 59th minute - tapping home from underneath the crossbar, after Luigi Sepe had failed to hold Mattia Caldara‚Äôs header. To add further to Salernitana‚Äôs troubles, Sepe was subbed off moments later by Vid Belec having picked up an injury in the aftermath of the goal.¬† However, super-sub Verdi restored the hosts‚Äô lead in the 67th minute with a brilliant strike that sailed into the top left-hand corner.¬† The Winged Lions‚Äô ambition to restore parity suffered a huge blow after Ethan Ampadu was given the marching orders for a second caution in the space of 60 seconds as the home team remained in control to complete a league double over Venice based outfit. While Nigeria‚Äôs Joel Obi was an unused substitute, Mali‚Äôs Lassana Coulibaly - who was handed a place in the starting XI - got replaced by Grigoris Kastanos in the 62nd minute. On the other hand, Nigeria‚Äôs David Okereke played for 63 minutes while his compatriot Tyronne Ebuehi was not dressed for action.¬† Although Venezia remain at the base of the Italian topflight log, they are seven points adrift of safety with only three matches left to play.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/obi-less-salernitana-climb-out-of-serie-a-relegation-zone/blt6ad6d8ea97502cf0,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,3be49f94-647b-4c94-86c3-cf3403b1b947
The 100 most expensive football transfers of all time,"Paris Saint-Germain shook up the football world in the summer of 2017 when they signed Neymar from Barcelona and then promptly prised Kylian Mbappe away from Monaco. They remain the two most expensive players of all time but there is no denying that PSG's sensational double swoop greatly inflated the transfer market. Get Your Winnings in No Time: Fast Withdrawal Betting Sites Indeed, a number of massive moves quickly followed, with Barcelona looking to try to fill the void left behind by Neymar by signing the likes of Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho and Antoine Griezmann for nine-figure fees. Also in Spain, Atletico Madrid splashed ‚Ç¨126m on Benfica's prodigious attacking talent Joao Felix, while Real Madrid finally brought Eden Hazard to Santiago Bernabeu for ‚Ç¨100m. The Covid-19 pandemic briefly had a massive impact on the transfer market, but within a couple of seasons a number of clubs had recovered, particularly in England. Numerous players have been signed by Premier League clubs for huge money since 2021, including Declan Rice, Enzo Fernandez, Jack Grealish, Jadon Sancho, Mykhailo Mudryk, Antony, Darwin Nunez and Moises Caicedo. Meanwhile, European giants such as Real Madrid have flexed their muscles with the high-profile signings of players like Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni, while the usually prudent Bayern Munich have also got in on the act by acquiring Harry Kane. Furtheremore, a new power has now emerged in the Middle East, with Saudi Pro League clubs having shaken up the transfer market in 2023 by signing the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Neymar. So, could the current transfer record soon be broken? It certainly seems possible. For now, though, Neymar remains top of the list of the 100 most expensive players of all time... Declan Rice became the most expensive British player in football history when he moved from West Ham to Arsenal in July 2023 in a whopping deal worth ‚Ç¨116m. Previously, the record belonged to Jack Grealish, whom Manchester City signed from Aston Villa for ‚Ç¨117m in the summer of 2021. Before Grealish's big move, Gareth Bale was football's most expensive Brit, with¬†Real Madrid breaking the world transfer record to sign the Welshman from Tottenham in 2013 for¬†‚Ç¨100.8m. Kylian Mbappe is the most expensive teenager ever, as he joined¬†PSG on a loan-to-buy deal in 2017 that will be worth¬†‚Ç¨180m¬†after bonuses. Joao Felix is the second-most expensive teenager, having been signed by Atletico¬†from Benfica for ‚Ç¨126m in 2019. Harry Maguire became the most expensive defender of all time when Manchester United forked out ‚Ç¨87.1m the England centre-half's¬†services in 2019. Maguire overtook Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk in the process, but only¬†marginally, as¬†the Netherlands international set the Reds back ‚Ç¨84.5m when he arrived from Southampton the year before. Kepa Arrizabalaga is the most expensive goalkeeper in history For a long time, former Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon held this honour, having joined the Turin outfit from Parma for¬†‚Ç¨52m, which is a colossal fee when inflation is taken into account. Then, within a matter of weeks in 2018, Buffon's¬†record was shattered twice. First, Liverpool brought in Roma's Alisson Becker for¬†‚Ç¨73m, to temporarily take the title of the world's most expensive keeper. But Chelsea snapped up Kepa less than a month later, propelling the Spain international into top spot by meeting the ‚Ç¨80m release clause in his Athletic Club contract. For seven years, the most a non-European club had paid for a player was the ‚Ç¨60.3m that Shanghai SIPG handed over to Chelsea for Brazil midfielder Oscar. However, Neymar now also holds this record, having been signed by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the summer of the 2023 for ‚Ç¨90m.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/100-most-expensive-football-transfers-all-time/ikr3oojohla51fh9adq3qkwpu,Mark Doyle,270ae65d-975b-47aa-a1e7-8bcc5a7a5f5a
Barcelona president Laporta on potential Dembele transfer: We haven't heard that Ousmane wants to stay,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta is pleased with Ousmane Dembele's recent upturn in form, but affirmed that if there has been any change in the forward's future plans it would be news to him.  Dembele is out of contract in June after five volatile, injury-interrupted seasons at Camp Nou.  But the French forward is now showing exactly what he is capable of on the field when fit, raising speculation that he could yet sign a new deal with Barca.  ""At the present time, on our part, we have not heard that [Dembele] wants to stay on,"" Laporta signalled to Mundo Deportivo.  ""I don't know if his agent has been in touch but I don't think so, because I would know, and we are focused first and foremost on this final stage of La Liga to try and win it. ""At the end of the season I suppose there may be some sort of talks but inside the salary limits we are setting.""   Dembele once more suffered from injury woes at the start of 2021-22, featuring in none of Barca's first 14 Liga matches due to hamstring and knee issues.  But he has come into his own since the start of the year, particularly when it comes to laying on chances for his team-mates, and has struck up a fine partnership with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front.  The forward has scored one and assisted a further seven goals in his last five league games, all of which ended in victories for the Catalans; and Laporta will not rule out the possibility of his staying past the current term.  ""I do not like to talk about hypotheticals,"" he added.  ""[If Dembele decides to open talks] we are open people and we like Dembele a lot, I have said it from the start and I have often made it very clear how much we appreciate him.  ""Also, now he is getting on really well with Aubameyang and [Samuel] Umtiti, there is a good atmosphere and he looks happy after every game. He gets on great with Auba and that is fantastic.""

Overmars leaves Ajax after 'inappropriate messages' to female colleagues,"Ajax director of football affairs Marc Overmars has left the club with immediate effect because of inappropriate messages he sent to female colleagues. The 48-year-old, who recently signed a contract extension until 2026, has made the decision to step down from his role following meetings with CEO Edwin van der Sar and the club's supervisory board. The director said he feels ""ashamed"" of his actions after it was revealed he had sent a series of messages to employees of the club. ""I am ashamed. Last week I was confronted with reports about my behavior. And how this has come across to others,"" Overmars said in a statement published on Ajax's website.  ""Unfortunately, I didn't realize that I was crossing the line with this, but that was made clear to me in recent days.  ""I suddenly felt enormous pressure. I apologise. Certainly for someone in my position, this behavior is unacceptable. I now see that too. But it is too late. I see no other option but to leave Ajax.  ""This also has a major impact on my private situation. That is why I ask everyone to leave me and my family alone."" In his comments on the situation, supervisory board chairman Leen Meijaard said the revelations of Overmars' messages were ""devastating for the women who have had to deal with the behavior"". He added: ""Marc is probably the best football director that Ajax has had. We upgraded and extended his contract for a reason. But, unfortunately, he has really gone over the line, so continuing as director was not an option, as he recognized himself. It is extremely painful for everyone. I want to express the wish that everyone involved is given the peace and privacy to process this."" The club's chief executive, Van der Sar, described the situation as ""appalling"", telling the club's website: ""I find the situation appalling for everyone and I agree with [supervisory board chairman] Leen Meijaard's words.  ""In my role, I also feel responsible to help colleagues. A safe working climate is very important for everyone at Ajax. We will pay even more attention to this in the near future. Marc and I have been playing together since the early 1990s, first at Ajax and then with the national team and we have been colleagues in the management of Ajax for almost ten years now.  ""That has now come to a very abrupt end. We are working on something very wonderful here at Ajax, so this news will also be a blow to everyone who cares about Ajax. But our ambitions remain the same.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/overmars-leaves-ajax-after-inappropriate-messages-to-female/blt4d9da032fc646f4a,By Peter McVitie,ab8d6875-86ba-4c29-8db5-37da60afeb58
Liverpool fear Thiago could miss Champions League final as midfielder faces anxious injury wait,"Liverpool are sweating over the fitness of Thiago Alcantara amid fears the midfielder will miss the Champions League final due to injury. The Spaniard was forced off at half-time of the Reds‚Äô 3-1 win over Wolves on the final day of the Premier League campaign, having pulled up when attempting a crossfield pass to Trent Alexander-Arnold. He will undergo a scan on Monday to establish the extent of the problem, but is a serious doubt to face Real Madrid in Saturday‚Äôs showdown in Paris. Speaking in his post-match press conference, Klopp offered only a vague update on Thiago‚Äôs status. He told reporters: ‚Äú[It‚Äôs] not good, but I can‚Äôt say more. He was outside with the families, had his little girl on his shoulders, so he could walk, that‚Äôs obviously a good sign. All the rest we will see from tomorrow. ‚Äú[It‚Äôs the] lower part of the body. I know it, but actually don‚Äôt want to talk now about it. We will see. ‚ÄúGive us a chance to have the [scan]; it makes the news not better or worse. We want to wait until we know more about it and then you will get the information as well.‚Äù Thiago would definitely have started against Real Madrid, and has been one of the Reds‚Äô star men in recent months. His passing range, composure, and ability to dictate and change the pace of the game would have been key against an experienced and high-class Madrid midfield. Liverpool, at least, expect to welcome back Fabinho for the final, the Brazilian having missed the last three games with a hamstring issue. He is expected to return to full training this week, and should be fit to start in Paris.  So too will Virgil van Dijk, who was back on the substitutes bench on Sunday, and Mohamed Salah, who came on to score his 31st goal of the season. If Thiago is out, then it is likely that Jordan Henderson and Naby Keita will line-up alongside Fabinho. Klopp also has the option of James Milner‚Äôs experience, but he is unlikely to gamble on Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott or Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. There was more bad news on the injury front this weekend, with Divock Origi denied the chance of a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career. The Belgian striker suffered a muscle issue in training on Saturday, and will not be fit to feature against Real Madrid. It means the 27-year-old has now played his last game for the Reds, with the expectation that he will join AC Milan on a free transfer in the coming weeks. ‚ÄúDiv is definitely out for the final because he [got] injured in the last second of the last session yesterday,‚Äù said Klopp. ‚ÄúHe got a muscle injury, so five days will not be enough for him. Apart from that, I think all have a chance ‚Äì and hopefully Thiago as well ‚Äì and then we will prepare.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-thiago-champions-league-final-injury/bltc6626cc246a96850,Neil Jones,bec80ab0-ab57-4e8e-8a51-7296b34f33ec

Reyna injury update: USMNT star gets good news after tearful exit prompted hamstring fears,"Borussia Dortmund have said Giovanni Reyna's injury is not as bad as initially feared. Reyna was handed his first start for BVB since August against Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday, having missed the majority of the 2021-22 campaign due to a serious hamstring injury. The 19-year-old looked lively in the first 30 minutes, but hobbled off in tears after going down while the hosts celebrated Marco Reus' opening goal. Boss Marco Rose gave a pessimistic first update on the United States men's national team star, however further tests have revealed the player could return within a matter of weeks. Rose was at first negative about the situation, saying Dortmund will be on hand to aid Reyna in his recovery to the best of their ability but admitting the initial indications were worrisome. ""Gio is really upset, you can see that in the pictures,"" the coach told reporters after his team's 6-0 victory. ""We'll get the boy back and we'll give him all the support because we need him because he's an excellent athlete."" Rose added on the cruel nature of Reyna's latest injury to DAZN: ""He's just gotten back from an injury, was in a really good mood, everyone was happy that he was back. ""It was important to have him on the pitch with his quality."" However, the club have since said worst-case fears ""did not materialise after detailed diagnostics. The team doctors assume that the American will be able to take part in the team training again within 14 days.'' Dortmund were able to confirm that Reyna's injury is not a serious one on Monday, with his team-mate Dan-Axel Zagadou set for a longer period out after suffering a knock in the same game. ""Unfortunately, Dan-Axel Zagadou tore a muscle fiber during yesterday‚Äôs match, however, Gio Reyna did not suffer a serious thigh injury,"" the club have written on Twitter. Still, Rose's assessment suggests that he will be a doubt for the second leg of their Europa League round of 32 tie against Rangers on Thursday.

Man Utd decline studied by Toto Wolff as Mercedes F1 chief sought to understand why 'great teams' eventually fail,"Mercedes Formula One chief Toto Wolff has revealed that he has studied Manchester United's recent slump to learn why some ""great teams"" are not able to sustain their success. Until the last decade, United had dominated the Premier League era, securing 13 top-flight titles between 1992 and 2013.  United have failed to add to that haul since Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge, however, and they currently seem further than ever from ending the drought.  After narrowly clinching sixth spot on the final day of last season, The Red Devils have lost their opening two games of 2022-23 to Brighton and Brentford under new manager Erik ten Hag.  ""I studied why great teams were not able to repeat great title [runs],"" Wolff told the Financial Times, referencing United's record under Ferguson. ""No sports team in any sport has ever won eight consecutive World Championship titles and there are many reasons for that, and what is at the core is the human. The human gets complacent. You are not energised in the same way you were before. You are maybe not as ambitious. ""I often get the question: 'How hard is that?' ""I had so many periods, so many episodes in my life that I would judge as difficult, that this is not on the same scale.  ""I don't think it's challenging in a way because I've had much harder times in all of my life, not particularly in Formula One, but this is actually within my comfort zone."" It couldn't, could it? üò≥ He added: ""In a way we are control freaks. Sometimes I feel like a football coach: There's a point where there's nothing more you can do and you have to leave it to the players on the pitch to get the job done. That's why when you're there you have those reactions. Sometimes you need to push the pressure release valve."" United have finished second in the Premier League twice since they last won a top-flight title in 2012-13. In 2017-18 they finished 19 points behind rivals Manchester City, a feat which then-manager Jose Mourinho has described as one of the biggest achievements of his career.  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also guided United to second in 2020-21, though again they finished well adrift of City, who won the league by 12 points.  The Red Devils have only finished in the top four on four occasions in the last nine years, and have not won a single piece of major silverware since their Europa League triumph under Mourinho in 2017.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-decline-studied-toto-wolff-mercedes-chief-why-great/blt5e572c3c978a81af,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,3ba4bc83-cb87-4011-a1ed-b80024e4d486
"Man Utd, Real Madrid or PSG - Who will Pochettino be managing next season?","There is no better illustration of the importance of Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League last-16 tie with Real Madrid to Mauricio Pochettino than the fact that he began preparing his players for the first leg nearly a month beforehand. The Argentine even told Danilo Pereira the previous week that he would be starting at the Parc des Princes, charged with not only containing Vinicius Junior, but also covering in defence for PSG's buccaneering right-back Achraf Hakimi. Pochettino's primary obsession, though, was ensuring that his players implemented a collective pressing game focused on recovering the ball early and high up the pitch, and designed specifically with Madrid in mind. Marco Verratti was asked to play the key role in that regard, and the Italy international responded sensationally. Kylian Mbappe may have decided the first leg in the hosts' favour with a superb solo strike right at the end, but Verratti was the undoubted man of the match, having hassled, harried and outclassed Madrid's legendary midfield trio of Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. The challenge now, of course, is for Pochettino's PSG to repeat the feat at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. After all, his job remains very much on the line. As well as PSG performed in the first leg, it will count for nothing if the Ligue 1 leaders are eliminated in Madrid, and as GOAL revealed last month, Pochettino's relationship with PSG sporting director Leonardo is approaching breaking point. Indeed, unless Pochettino manages to win the Champions League this season, it is highly likely that he will leave Paris this summer, a year before the end of his contract. Mauricio Pochettino's relationship with PSG is breaking down üò¨Could Pochettino be heading to Manchester United this summer? üëÄ‚úçÔ∏è @LeMechenoua Tension began to mount last summer, after the arrival of several high-profile signings, with Pochettino instead pushing for a clear-out. However, the former Tottenham boss' wish was not granted, and he was left with a bloated 30-strong squad full of unhappy players deemed surplus to requirements. Pochettino was left less than impressed, then, when he requested the signing of Tanguy Ndombele in January, only to be told that Leonardo was now focused on reducing the size of the squad. Ndombele instead joined Lyon on loan, and a bitterly frustrated Pochettino felt that a glaring opportunity to strengthen his midfield had been missed. On the flip side, some at PSG believed that Pochettino should have been getting more out of the players already at his disposal. The team may be running away with Ligue 1, 13 points clear of second-placed Nice, but performances have often been unconvincing, and downright atrocious in certain games. The club were particularly concerned by the dismal display PSG produced in their Coupe de France last-16 exit at home to Nice at the end of January, with the reigning champions eliminated 6-5 on penalties after a 0-0 draw. Nice have knocked PSG out of the Coupe de France on penalties üò≥ pic.twitter.com/e9SLp4lWiL The pressure on Pochettino only intensified, and we are now in a situation where a club that ruled out accepting any potential offer from Manchester United for their coach in November might now sack him should they be knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday. But if Pochettino does part company with PSG ‚Äì before or at the end of the season ‚Äì where will he likely end up? Madrid are long-time admirers, of course, having previously tried on a couple of occasions to lure him away from Tottenham. However, Carlo Ancelotti's job is safe now, particularly with Madrid leading La Liga, while Pochettino would face stiff competition for any possible vacancy anyway. GOAL also understands that Pochettino favours a return to England. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy tried to bring him back to north London in 2021 before hiring first Nuno Espirito Santo and subsequently Antonio Conte, and he could call again should the ex-Inter boss walk before his contract expires, which is obviously always a risk with such a demanding character. However, Old Trafford remains the likelier next destination for Pochettino. Mauricio Pochettino to Man Utd.Discuss. pic.twitter.com/m46dkkShz3 United seriously considered hiring him after Jose Mourinho's acrimonious exit in December 2018, but eventually decided to appoint interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on a full-time basis. As it stands, there appears little chance of them putting their faith in another caretaker coach, given Ralf Rangnick's reign is hardly inspiring confidence. And besides, the German is scheduled to take on a consultancy role at the end of the season. Crucially, Pochettino is not only respected by legendary United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, but several members of the current senior squad are also avid admirers. For example, Marcus Rashford is presently considering his future at the club but it is believed that he would welcome the arrival of Pochettino, who would have tried to sign the England man last summer had Kylian Mbappe departed for Real Madrid. Pochettino is not the only managerial candidate, of course, with Ajax coach Erik ten Hag very much in the running. However, with United having stepped up their search for a new boss last month, after Richard Arnold replaced Ed Woodward as chief executive, it seems highly likely that Pochettino will at least be asked about his interest in taking over at Old Trafford. And that approach would definitely come sooner rather than later if PSG bow out of the Champions League at the Bernabeu.

Toko Ekambi‚Äôs dramatic late Lyon strike spoils Djiku and Strasbourg‚Äôs joy in Ligue 1,"Cameroon striker Karl Toko Ekambi was the hero for Lyon as his late effort helped snatch a 1-1 away draw against Alexander Djiku‚Äôs Strasbourg in Ligue 1 on Sunday. Ibrahima Sissoko gave the hosts a first-half lead but the Indomitable Lion netted a last-gasp equaliser to salvage a point for his side in the matchday 31 fixture at Stade de la Meinau. It was Toko Ekambi‚Äôs eighth goal of the season for Lyon who occupy the 10th position on the league table. Strasbourg, meanwhile, sit fourth on the log.  While the Cameroonian was the only African player in Lyon‚Äôs first XI, the hosts‚Äô starting set-up featured Ghana defender Djiku and Cote d‚ÄôIvoire midfielder Jean-Eudes Aholou. Sissoko broke the deadlock in the 20th minute, beating an offside trap to head home from Ludovic Ajorque‚Äôs perfectly-weighted delivery into the box. It was then agony after agony for the visitors as Anthony Lopes and Houssem Aouar had to be replaced in the 30th and 62nd minutes, respectively, due to injury.  As though there had not been enough forced substitutions in the game already, Strasbourg‚Äôs Anthony Caci had to go off for Frederic Guilbert in the 74th minute due to injury.  Ten minutes later, Lyon were forced into another injury-induced substitution as Tanguy Ndombele went off for Jeff Reine-Adelaide. The hosts appeared on course to win all three points until the 90th minute when Toko Ekambi pounced on a loose ball at the far post to stab home the equaliser from close range after Strasbourg‚Äôs defence failed to appropriately clear a cross into the box. The Cameroonian played for the entirety of the game, as did Djiku for Strasbourg but Aholou was hauled off in the 70th minute.  Zimbabwe striker Tino Kadewere came on for OL in the 62nd minute but Senegal forward Habib Diallo and Mali attacker Dion Moise Sahi were both unused substitutes. Strasbourg will be hoping to return to winning ways in their next match against Troyes while Lyon will have a similar ambition when they take on Bordeaux.  Both Toko Ekambi and Djiku are expected to feature for Cameroon and Ghana, respectively, at the World Cup in Qatar later this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/toko-ekambi-dramatic-lyon-djiku-strasbourg-ligue-1/blt45be1f8fee9d9908,Prince  Narkortu Teye,ace4f377-3f0d-4255-8267-185728155c10
Premier League European qualification: Teams in Champions League & Europa League next season,"Another thrilling Premier League campaign has come to a close in 2021-22, with much sought-after tickets to Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League parties handed out alongside a prestigious title trophy. Only four places among the continental elite have been secured through final top-flight standings, but three consolation prizes have also been snapped up. Some heavyweight outfits have hit their ultimate targets when it comes to European qualification, but others have been left disappointed after seeing struggles for consistency cost them dear. Which sides have ended up where for 2022-23? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Title-chasing Manchester City and Liverpool are guaranteed to be gracing the group stage of next season‚Äôs Champions League. They took another battle for domestic supremacy down to the wire in 2021-22, with the Blues prevailing by a solitary point after a thrilling final day. It appeared for long periods as though Chelsea would ease their way to third place, but the Blues had to survive an uncharacteristic wobble in order to ensure that no nervous glances were shot over collective shoulders. Arsenal, after a five-year absence from European football‚Äôs top table, have missed out on a place in the Premier League‚Äôs top four once again, with the exploits of north London neighbours Tottenham leaving them on the outside looking in. Teams qualifying for the Champions League: Team Position Manchester City 1st Liverpool 2nd Chelsea 3rd Tottenham 4th Arsenal looked to be cruising back into the Champions League with only a few weeks of the season remaining, but all too familiar struggles for consistency crept in and led to an untimely slip down the standings being endured. The Gunners could only finish fifth and have Thursday night football on the agenda for 2022-23. Manchester United are in a similar boat, with the Red Devils seeing Champions League ambitions dashed for a fourth time in the space of seven years. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was unable to get the Red Devils firing, even after acquiring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho, and interim coach Ralf Rangnick will head upstairs into a consultancy role at Old Trafford this summer knowing that he has also failed to deliver on his remit. There was a very real threat that United, who are have posted their worst Premier League finish, could slip out of sixth spot and complete another humbling fall from grace, but they survived a 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on the final day as West Ham failed to overhaul them.

They could have clambered out of seventh and above Manchester United in the final round of fixtures, but threw away a half-time lead at Brighton to lose 3-1 at the Amex Stadium and end on a disappointing note.

Mourinho slams Roma's 'psychological collapse' after extraordinary Juventus comeback,"Jose Mourinho blamed Roma's ""psychological complex"" for their epic collapse against Juventus on Sunday. Roma were up 3-1 midway through the second half, only to lose 4-3 as Mourinho's side fell apart in stunning fashion. And, after another frustrating result, Mourinho said he believes Roma have psychological problems that they will need to work through. Through 70 minutes, Roma were up two goals after Tammy Abraham, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Lorenzo Pellegrini had all scored. But, starting with a 70th-minute goal from Manuel Locatelli, Juve stormed back, with Dejan Kulusevski and Mattia De Sciglio helping complete a stunning comeback that saw three goals in seven minutes. Roma had a chance to equalise after Mathijs de Ligt was called for a handball in the box, but Pellegrini's penalty kick was saved by Wojciech Szczesny to preserve Juve's win. ‚ÄúWe were in total control for 70 minutes,‚Äù Mourinho told DAZN. ‚ÄúThe team played really well and had the mentality of taking control, we came out and started strong. We had this idea of the high press, of controlling the tempo and taking the initiative. ‚ÄúIt was so good for 70 minutes, then there was this psychological collapse. The 3-2 killed us, because Felix [Afena-Gyan] had an extraordinary game, which finished with a sprint against [Juan] Cuadrado. I take him off and his replacement [Eldor Shomurodov] gets it all wrong. ‚ÄúWhen we allowed them back in for 3-2, a team with a strong mentality like Juventus, a strong character, the fear set in. A psychological complex. It‚Äôs not a problem for me having 3-2, it‚Äôs a problem for them. For my team. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, when you‚Äôre in the s**t, you get back on your feet and find your character. But there are people in this locker room who are a bit too nice, a bit too weak. ‚ÄúI already told the players, if the game had ended at the 70th minute, it would‚Äôve been an extraordinary performance. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt end then.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-slams-roma-s-psychological-collapse-after-extraordinary-/bltcb0a5a9488055e9e,Ryan Tolmich,64eaba62-04f7-410b-b1db-859e931afd7a
Former Venezuela WNT coaches banned after being found guilty of abusing players,"The Venezuelan Football Federation (FVF) has handed down bans to former women's team coaches Kenneth Zseremeta and William Pino following the conclusion of their investigation into allegations against the former of sexual abuse during his time in charge of the youth squad. An open letter signed by two-dozen players last autumn sparked an investigation into the pair's conduct during their tenure in the national set-up. With the conclusion of their operation, the FVF has now handed down lengthy sanctions to the duo, with Zseremeta banned for 20 years and Pino for eight. ""Given the public complaint made by some members of the women's team, based on the factual and legal considerations set forth, the Ethics Commission declared Zseremeta guilty,"" read an official statement. Additionally, the sentence ""prohibits for a period of 20 years their [Zseremeta ] participation in any type of activity related to soccer at the national level."" Pino was found ""guilty of infringing article 24 (protection of physical and mental integrity),"" the governing body added. Twenty-four Venezuelan women's footballers signed a statement last October, headed by Atletico Madrid's Deyna Castellanos, accusing former youth coach Zseremeta of sexual, physical and psychological abuse over a four-year period.

'Mum has no money for food' - Six-year-old Swindon fan sends heartbreaking letter with 26 pence for striker McKirdy as '#FindJoe' search starts,"Swindon Town have reached out to the general public in their search for a six-year-old fan who sent a heartbreaking letter to the club containing 26 pence to give to striker Harry McKirdy.

"Nike, adidas and the end of the traditional boot deal: Haaland, Sterling and Vinicius set the trend","Vinicius Junior made waves with a simple but powerful act of defiance during Real Madrid's 2-0 victory over Valencia on Thursday, February 3.  During the first half of that La Liga clash, the Brazilian played in blacked-out Nike boots, robbing the sportswear giant of the brand awareness they'd hoped for when they signed him up to a 10-year sponsorship contract in 2013.  Vinicius was just 13 years old when he penned his initial deal with the company and he extended terms by a further decade in 2018. However, since that new contract was signed the forward's profile has exploded.  Now one of the most marketable players on the planet, Vinicius' protest was in response to a perceived lack of appreciation for his new world-class status. However, Vinicius did slip on some neon yellow boots for the second half and, ironically, this coincided with a marked improvement in his display.  Shortly after Marco Asensio had given Madrid the lead with a stunning left-footed effort from outside the box, Vinicius channeled a mix of Gareth Bale and Thierry Henry, showing devastating pace to race onto a through pass before rolling the ball past the stricken Giorgi Mamardashvili.  After the incident, a source close to the player told The Athletic: ""Vini‚Äôs contract with Nike has expired. We are in no hurry to sign with another brand. The key for us is to find the right company that appreciates and believes in Vini and is willing to invest in his brand through campaigns and activation worldwide."" The comments offer a neat summation of the changing nature of the traditional boot deal in 2023. This is a trend that has been slowly brewing since the pandemic, with the game's brightest stars seeking more autonomy over their image than ever before.  For instance, when Erling Haaland made his first appearance for Manchester City ‚Äì in a pre-season friendly against Bayern Munich ‚Äì he was spotted wearing the adidas X SPEEDPORTAL boots. The sight of the Norwegian striker in the bright green boots started the speculation cycle, with rumours that he was on the cusp of signing a permanent deal with adidas. Instead, Haaland followed up his Three Stripe appearance by wearing the Nike Mercurial Vapor 14 for his Premier League debut. Throughout his young career so far, Haaland has always been a Mercurial man, and it seems fitting that he scored his first Premier League goals while wearing his favourite silhouette. Haaland‚Äôs relationship with Nike, and the Mercurial, had previously been more formal, with a lucrative ‚Ç¨1 million deal in place with the American giant. That deal came to an end at the start of January 2022, and Haaland has been without an official boot deal ever since. The striker seems to be enjoying the freedom though. On-pitch, he‚Äôs been able to try out new adidas silhouettes alongside his preferred Nike option, while away from the pitch, he‚Äôs been spotted in new releases from each brand, including the Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low ‚ÄúReverse Mocha‚Äù and a recent Liam Gallagher x adidas Spezial collaboration. In addition, last year The Athletic reported on Thiago (who wore adidas, Nike, blacked-out boots and even Mizuno), Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka amongst others, all of whom were coming to the end of their Nike deals and due to be released by the Swoosh.  Since then, all three players have signed new deals ‚Äì Thiago with adidas, while Saka and Sterling are at the forefront of the New Balance revolution ‚Äì but the endorsement landscape has changed dramatically as brands take a different direction. The reasons for the new approach from major brands have never been disclosed, and a number of theories were put forward. The most obvious is the financial impact of COVID-19, which hit Nike and adidas hard and led to a general belt-tightening. In this context, it makes sense if Nike cut back on some of their secondary endorsement deals, and instead focus on the reliable big hitters: Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe. Nike has also narrowed its scope to focus on players who fit into its ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù-driven approach. The brand has continued to champion Marcus Rashford, and reworked its ‚ÄúDream Crazy‚Äù ad format to celebrate the Manchester United player with the line ‚ÄúBoys from Wythenshawe don‚Äôt just become champions. They champion change.‚Äù Similarly, New Balance‚Äôs decision to sign up players like Sterling were driven by the same ambition, and if those comments to The Athletic are anything to go by, Vinicius - an outspoken critic of La Liga's handling of racist abuse - is looking for a similar deal with his new sponsor. When he announced the partnership in 2021, Sterling said that he wants ‚Äúto continue to do things that help people, that give them opportunities and a chance to better their lives.‚Äù He went on to explain that New Balance shared this vision, and this was why he decided to sign with them, rather than the rumoured Jordan and PUMA deals. As major brands take a step back from the sometimes scattergun approach to endorsements, they will continue to champion their biggest names ‚Äì and best sellers. For Nike, this is Ronaldo and Mbappe, while adidas have a lifetime deal with Lionel Messi and PUMA signed a huge endorsement deal with Neymar Jr. Other players, though, stand to lose out on a potentially lucrative income stream.¬† The benefit for players, if they move outside of this set structure, is the freedom that comes with it. While Haaland can now choose which trainers he wears whenever he wants, he will also be free from the most far-reaching aspects of a boot deal. In some instances, this can go far beyond just the boots or trainers worn by a player on match days, and cover a whole host of other products. If you‚Äôre signed to a brand like adidas, which makes everything from deodorant to headphones as well, this can have a huge impact. Writing on his blog, sports lawyer Daniel Geey explained that these deals can cover everything, including ‚Äúathletic footwear, clothing and accessories like bags, gloves and hats‚Ä¶ [it] may also cover sunglasses, golf clubs, sports equipment, headphones, personal care and hygiene products, watches and electronic accessories‚Äù. Crucially, this sort of deal can also limit other partnerships for a player. Sure, their boot deal might be one of their biggest deals, but if it reduces the capacity to sign other endorsements, then the financial risk may outweigh the benefits. As Geey continues, ‚Äúif a player‚Äôs boot deal is so wide to cover a large number of products, the player should be aware that the scope to enter into additional commercial deals will be limited.‚Äù A player‚Äôs freedom isn‚Äôt just tied to the ability to sign commercial deals. Some just like to have the choice to wear what they want, while others relish no longer having to toe the party line or would rather push their own projects instead. When Mesut Ozil‚Äôs contract with adidas was winding down, his agent announced that he would focus on his own label. ‚ÄúSome players reach the end of their career and then try to build a brand, but we think that is too late,‚Äù said Dr. Erkut Sogut. ‚ÄúYou can either work with these brands for life like David Beckham or Zinedine Zidane, or you can build your own brand, using the time when you are still actively playing to promote things.‚Äù The traditional boot deal is being squeezed from both sides. On one hand, manufacturers are focusing on high-profile players who can offer a guaranteed return, while on the other hand players, newly liberated from restrictive commercial contracts, are relishing the freedom. It‚Äôs unlikely that players will rip up their contracts en masse, but more and more players are showing that they can prosper outside of the usual framework. Somewhat surprisingly, a new model for boot deals could benefit both players and brands.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nike-adidas-end-traditional-boot-deal-haaland-sterling-saka/blt779b9f1324e5e393,Jack Stanley and ,7377261e-9f11-4464-abe6-300cb2a22f27
'Pulisic is special' - Lampard backs USMNT star to keep his place at Chelsea despite Sterling transfer,"Frank Lampard believes Christian Pulisic can still be a very important player for Chelsea, even after the club's recent signing of Raheem Sterling. Chelsea paid ¬£47.5 million ($57m)¬†to sign Sterling this week, adding further competition for places in an already-crowded squad. But Lampard, who managed Pulisic during his time as Chelsea boss, says that Pulisic has the ability to be a special player, adding that the American has a skill set that few in the world can match. ‚ÄúI think Christian can still be a big player for Chelsea, of course, a really big player, but that‚Äôs absolutely a question for the club and him,‚Äù Lampard told Pro Soccer Wire. ‚ÄúChristian needs to play games. I know what he‚Äôs like, he wants to play all the time. He‚Äôs had some injuries, I think it‚Äôs sometimes held him back at different times in his career. So I just hope we get the right solution. I have a lot of respect for Chelsea. It‚Äôs a huge club in my life and career. So I hope we get the best solution for both.‚Äù Lampard went on to praise Pulisic even further, saying that the American still has the ability to be an ""incredible"" player in the future. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a lot of time for Christian,‚Äù Lampard said. ‚ÄúI think I worked well with him and just tried to develop him and had a really good relationship with him. He‚Äôs got incredible talent. He‚Äôs a great boy. I found him really pleasurable to work with as well as a talent. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really fast and [has a quick] change in direction and it‚Äôs balanced. He‚Äôs still a young player. It feels like he‚Äôs been around a long time because he broke through so young. So there‚Äôs still a lot to come from Christian, but those basics of the speed and balance is not [something] everyday players have. He‚Äôs special like that.‚Äù¬† The 23-year-old is entering his fourth season at Chelsea, having joined the club in 2019 from Borussia Dortmund. When healthy, he's been a regular for the Blues, making 115 appearances and scoring 25 goals since making the move to London. However, fitness has been an issue for Pulisic, who has dealt with a series of injuries since his arrival. This summer, he's been linked with a potential departure, with the arrival of Sterling adding further doubts about his future.

Former Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund defender Sergio Gomez joins Man City in ¬£11m transfer,"Manchester City have confirmed the capture of Spanish left-back Sergio Gomez from Belgian club Anderlecht. The Premier League champions were in need of a full-back after allowing Oleksandr Zinchenko to join Arsenal in a ¬£32million ($38m) deal.  City will pay an initial ¬£11m ($13m) fee for the 21-year-old with the potential for the price to rise further in unspecified add-ons.  The former Spain youth international was originally considered a development player by the Premier League champions and was expected to go on loan to sister club Girona in the Spanish top-flight.  But Pep Guardiola has decided to keep a player who started his career in Barcelona's La Masia Academy as an attacking midfielder before moving on to Borussia Dortmund.  He spent two seasons on loan with Spanish side Huesca before moving to Anderlecht, where he starred under former City captain Vincent Kompany, claiming 15 assists and being named the club's Player of the Year.  Gomez has committed to a four-year contract at the Etihad Stadium. The talented defender will stay on Man City's books through to the end of the 2025-26 season. Our new number 21 üëïüíô#ManCity pic.twitter.com/5oGXj5ZdUY ‚ÄúCity are the best team in England and in Pep Guardiola I have a chance to learn and develop under the most outstanding manager in world football,"" Gomez said after his move was made official.  ‚ÄúTo be able to be part of this club is a dream come true for me and something any young player would aspire to.  ‚ÄúThe number of trophies City have won over the past few years has been incredible and the style of football the team plays under Pep is the most exciting in Europe. Playing for and being guided by Pep and his coaches is going to be very special.""  Gomez will wear the 21 shirt last worn by Ferran Torres but more famously used by club legend David Silva.  ""When [my brother] went on a school trip to London, I asked him to buy me the Manchester City shirt with the name and number of David Silva. At that time, I was wearing the number 21 too,"" he added.  ""He was one of my favourite players in that position because when I was a kid I used to play in Silva's position. That's the story of the shirt and I have kept it well since.‚Äù  City have had a relatively busy window allowing senior players Zinchenko, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus to leave while bringing in Erling Haaland, Kalvin Phillips, Julian Alvarez and now Gomez.  After missing out on top target Marc Cucurella, who left Brighton for Chelsea in a record ¬£62m ($75m) deal, City were looking at other left-backs but Guardiola is happy that Gomez and Academy player Josh Wilson-Esbrand can now provide competition for Joao Cancelo.

Chelsea summer transfers being hampered by takeover uncertainty admits Tuchel: 'Our hands are tied',"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has admitted that the club's current uncertain situation will have a negative impact when it comes to dealing in the summer transfer window.  The Blues have been affected by government sanctions on outgoing owner Roman Abramovich which have a huge impact on day-to-day operations at Stamford Bridge.  Activity in the upcoming window is therefore likely to be at a minimum, though Tuchel hopes that a change in ownership might bring some relief. According to Tuchel, the ongoing sanctions have prevented the club from making any moves prior to the window opening. ""You‚Äôre never fully sure but we would have some targets and we would have for sure contacted some players and found out about their situations. Of course,"" the manager told reporters on Wednesday.  ""Now our hands are tied, we can still have the talks inside the building but we cannot act. ""The situation is not ideal. This is the situation. It would be challenging enough with a stable situation. We don‚Äôt have that ‚Äì so everybody is doing it, at least I know, for the first time.  ""And we try to show our commitment, our passion for it and this is maybe for me very important to give this message: I‚Äôm committed, I‚Äôm looking forward to it and I‚Äôm passionate about it. ""And as soon as we can act we will try to act and turn things around and make it from a disadvantage maybe an advantage. However, I don‚Äôt have the solution right now but we will try to stay positive about it."" Potential relief may arrive in the shape of a takeover, with three bidders currently in the running to buy out Abramovich.‚ÄúThis might happen. There is also financial fair play and these things exist on top of it,"" Tuchel added when asked about the effects of a change in ownership. ""I also think it is not possible that a new owner comes in and hands over and says ‚Äòhere go wild, here is ¬£250 million go and spend it‚Äô. There are also other rules in place. I don‚Äôt want to write it off right now because it isn‚Äôt even May. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too early. There is still faith in the people who take care of it from our side. And still faith in that everybody is on it and that we finish it as fast as possible and we try to be prepared behind the scenes so that if we get a green light to act that we are ready and share our views on the team.

Guendouzi's ‚Ç¨10.5m Arsenal exit imminent as Gunners wait on Jesus and Tielemans,"Matteo Guendouzi‚Äôs move to Marseille will soon be completed as Arsenal step up their attempts to shift a host of unwanted squad players this summer. Guendouzi spent the 2021-22 campaign on loan in the south of France and enjoyed a fine season, helping¬†Jorge Sampaoli's side to a second-placed finish in Ligue 1 and forcing his way into Didier Deschamps‚Äô France squad. And his move is now set to become permanent, with the midfielder one of several players Arsenal want to move on in the coming weeks. Arsenal will receive around ‚Ç¨10.5 million (¬£9m/$11.2m) for the France international. The transfer fee was agreed last summer as part of the loan that initially took Guendouzi to Marseille. Marseille originally paid around ¬£850,000 to take the midfielder on loan for the season, and had an option included in the deal to make the move permanent in the summer of 2022. That option is now set to be triggered, with the deal to be wrapped up soon after Guendouzi‚Äôs involvement with the France national team in the UEFA Nations League is over. Arsenal remain in talks with Fiorentina over the sale of Lucas Torreira. The Serie A side have expressed a willingness to sign the midfielder on a permanent deal after his successful loan spell last season, but have yet to table a suitable offer for the Uruguay international. Torreira wants to join Fiorentina and Arsenal still hope a deal can be agreed in the coming weeks. Hector Bellerin‚Äôs future has yet to be decided, with the defender keen to join Real Betis on a permanent basis following last season‚Äôs loan spell. Betis would like to sign the right-back and Arsenal have made it clear that they will sell, but Bellerin‚Äôs wages are currently proving problematic. The 27-year-old agreed to drastically reduce his salary last season to push through his loan move, and Betis have made it clear he will have to take another massive pay cut if they are to make his stay permanent. Arsenal are also looking to move on Pablo Mari and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, while talks are continuing with Feyenoord over Reiss Nelson, who spent last season on loan with the Eredivisie side. Bernd Leno and Nicolas Pepe could also leave, if suitable offers arrive. Arsenal‚Äôs two priority signings are Gabriel Jesus and Youri Tielemans. Talks with the representatives of both players have been ongoing for months, and Arsenal remain hopeful that deals can be done this summer. They do face competition for Jesus, however, with the Manchester City striker‚Äôs future set to become clearer following his involvement with the Brazil national team. Tielemans is also away on international duty and admitted this week that he could move this summer, once Belgium's upcoming fixtures against Wales and Poland are out the way. The Leicester City midfielder has one year left on his contract and could be available for around ¬£25m ($31m). Arsenal also hold an interest in Manchester City star Oleksandr Zinchenko and are keeping tabs on Everton forward Richarlison's situation.¬† They have also held talks with the agent of Napoli striker Victor Osimhen, but are aware that striking a deal for the Nigeria international would be very difficult.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guendouzi-arsenal-exit-imminent-marseille-jesus-tielemans/bltbe9bcb962356c871,Charles Watts,5044e3e0-cf41-4e7e-86e9-517554701675

"USMNT injury report: All the latest on Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, and every Stars and Stripes star's fitness status","The 2022 World Cup is over, but the U.S. men's national team's road to the 2026 tournament on home soil has already gotten started. It began, in earnest, in January with the annual camp, but the cycle truly begins later this month with the return of the Nations League. Those matches against Grenada and El Salvador will be the first time the team's European-based stars can be called on since their time in Qatar as the U.S. now looks ahead to the next four years. Over those four years, the U.S. will play in the Nations League, Gold Cup and, most notably, Copa America as they look to lay a foundation for 2026.

Iwobi makes Premier League history with last-minute winner for Everton against Newcastle United,"Alex Iwobi scored the second-latest winning goal in the Premier League since the 2006-07 season with his 99th-minute strike as Everton edged Newcastle United 1-0 on Thursday. Following a fine run from the midfield, Iwobi finished off an assist from Dominic Calvert-Lewin with a well-placed shot past goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. The Nigeria international's goal at the Goodison Park came after 98 minutes and 19 seconds, behind Bruno Fernandes' winning strike for Manchester United against Brighton & Hove Albion in September 2020 (99:45). The match had been delayed shortly after the restart because a fan ran to the pitch and tied himself to the goalpost which eventually resulted in the addition of nine minutes of stoppage time. The effort was Iwobi's second Premier League goal of the season and third in all competitions which includes his League Cup strike against Huddersfield Town back in August. The victory came as a relief for Everton as it ended their four-game losing run in the Premier League, for their first win since February 12 when they defeated Leeds United 3-0. After breaking his hand while celebrating, Lampard praised match-winner Iwobi and he described the late goal as a reward for his hard work in training. ‚ÄúHe trains so well. You see how hard he works,‚Äù Lampard told the club‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúI'm delighted he's the man that gets the goal to win it for us. He needs to believe in himself more because we know the quality he has. ""I've broken my hand in the celebrations. My bones must be going soft, I don't remember the moment. ""It was an amazing night and we need those nights. Spirit and togetherness, the players stood up tonight. It was not a night for quality or calm. It means so much to the stadium we all felt that. I wanted to use the atmosphere. ""Everton fans wanted to see passion. We proved what we could be tonight."" The Toffees remain in the 17th spot despite the win, with 25 points and two games in hand. Next up for Lampard's men, is an FA Cup clash against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/iwobi-makes-premier-league-history-with-last-minute-winner/blt8f07059ca24e927f,By Taiye Taiwo,f0d27a48-4055-4053-9939-fe02dd20f3fd
FA Cup prize money: How much do 2021-22 winning teams earn?,"Winning the FA Cup is always an event worth celebrating, especially when it brings with it some healthy financial rewards, and particularly for those lower-league clubs who manage to advance through the rounds. The overall prize pot on offer from the Football Association may not be as lucrative as it once was, with belts being tightened on the back of a global pandemic, but major silverware is still worth securing and the prize money undoubtedly makes a difference to those lower down the football pyramid. Indeed, there is plenty of magic still to be found in the FA Cup and, with that in mind, GOAL takes a look and how much clubs stand to earn on the long road to Wembley. The FA Cup is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2022, with Wanderers the first winners of one of the oldest prizes in world football back in 1872. The game has come a long way since then and even those that started out in the extra-preliminary rounds back in August will receive some financial reward for their efforts. It has always been the case, though, that the spoils go to the victors and the winners of this season‚Äôs competition will once again receive a trophy-winning bonus of ¬£1.8 million ($2.4m). A full breakdown of the FA Cup prize money for 2021-22 can be found in the table below. Round No. of teams Prize money Extra preliminary round winners 174 ¬£1,125 Extra preliminary round losers 174 ¬£375 Preliminary round winners 155 ¬£1,444 Preliminary round losers 155 ¬£481 First round qualifying winners 121 ¬£2,250 First round qualifying losers 121 ¬£750 Second round qualifying winners 82 ¬£3,375 Second round qualifying losers 82 ¬£1,125 Third round qualifying winners 41 ¬£5,625 Third round qualifying losers 41 ¬£1,875 Fourth round qualifying winners 32 ¬£9,375 Fourth round qualifying losers 32 ¬£3,125 First round proper winners 40 ¬£22,629 Second round proper winners 20 ¬£34,000 Third round proper winners 32 ¬£82,000 Fourth round proper winners 16 ¬£90,000 Fifth round proper winners 8 ¬£180,000 Quarter-final winners 4 ¬£360,000 Semi-final winners 2 ¬£900,000 Semi-final losers 2 ¬£450,000 Final runners-up 1 ¬£900,000 Final winners 1 ¬£1,800,000 For the Premier League and Championship sides that entered the FA Cup at the third-round stage, ultimate glory is worth a little over ¬£3.4m ($4.6m), while beaten finalists would pocket ¬£2.5m ($3.3m). The prize pots do jump up sharply the further through the competition you go, with there some serious cash on offer once you make it through round four. Alongside the bonuses that accompany progress down a path to the home of English football, those clubs involved in the most appealing of fixtures also stand to benefit from television coverage contracts. Not much has changed over the course of the last 12 months when it comes to dividing up the FA Cup prize pot. Some slight tweaks have been made, with money increasing from the first round proper, but big changes were already made in 2020-21. Prize money was slashed last season, from what it had been in 2019-20, with Leicester ‚Äì who prevailed in a keenly-fought final clash with Premier League champions Manchester City - pulling in half of what Arsenal had earned some 12 months earlier.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fa-cup-prize-money-how-much-2021-22-winning-teams-earn/blta4ca71b5f8850b03,Chris Burton,4fb6ed33-0c2c-43fe-8f80-bc6d60fd49d2
UFC star McGregor offers ¬£1.5bn for Chelsea in bid on Twitter,"UFC star Conor McGregor has taken to Twitter to submit an offer for Chelsea as bidders continue to line up for the club. Roman Abramovich announced his intention to sell the club this week amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the longtime Blues owner saying he'll donate the money earned from the sale to aid Ukraine's rebuilding effort. Several potential parties have emerged to say they've been interested in buying Chelsea, but not quite like McGregor, who made his offer via social media. McGregor originally said he'd like to buy the club last week, saying that he ""wished to explore"" the potential purchase of the club. I wish to explore this. @ChelseaFC pic.twitter.com/ABEjjCqhD7 On Friday, amid reports that Abramovich will require a bid of around ¬£3 billion, McGregor submitted an offer of half that amount. While McGregor's true plan, or whether he'd bring in more investors, is unclear, the longtime MMA champion was Forbes' highest-paid athlete in 2021, making around $180 million (¬£136m). Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak has also made an offer to buy Chelsea from Abramovich, with around 10 such approaches made in recent days. There's a deadline for offers on March 15, and, as things stand, the early favourites remain the US-Swiss consortium headed up by Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss. Bayrak, the chairman of AB Grup, a construction company, announced on Friday his desire to strike a deal to buy Chelsea, with a representative telling the Guardian: ‚ÄúYes we definitely confirm. We have forwarded our offer regarding this to them.‚Äù Bayrak‚Äôs interest first became known when he told Turkish media: ‚ÄúWe are discussing the terms of Chelsea‚Äôs purchase with Roman Abramovich‚Äôs lawyers.

"Chelsea vs West Ham: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Chelsea welcome West Ham to Stamford Bridge on Sunday for a London derby in the Premier League with Thomas Tuchel's men aiming to get back to winning ways. The Blues were beaten 4-2 at home by another capital club, Arsenal, in midweek and will be looking for three points against a Hammers side who will surely have one eye on their Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday night. The Blues' last two home league matches have both been London derbies, which they have lost, conceding four goals in the process to both Arsenal and Brentford. West Ham are offered at 11/2 (6.50) with bet365 to make it a hat-trick of defeats for Chelsea, while the hosts are priced at 1/2 (1.50) with the draw at 16/5 (4.20). Romelu Lukaku is the shortest priced player to score first at 4/1 (5.00) with Kai Havertz at 9/2 (5.50) and Mason Mount offered at 5/1 (6.00). For the visitors, top scorer Jarrod Bowen is available at 14/1 (15.00), the same price as Said Benrahma, while Michail Antonio can be backed at 9/1 (10.00). The Blues' questionable home form is arguably one of the main factors in them slipping out of the title race with Chelsea winning just three of their last 10 league clashes at Stamford Bridge. Tuchel's men have kept just five clean sheets in their 15 home league matches this term and West Ham will feel they can, at the very least, get on the score sheet in west London this weekend. David Moyes' side have netted in 13 of their last 16 competitive fixtures and, while they may struggle to keep their minds from wandering to Thursday's Europa League showdown, the Hammers have shown they are an excellent attacking unit this term, with 17 different players scoring in the Premier League. Both teams to score seems an obvious selection and is offered at the healthy looking price of 10/11 (1.91). Combining this selection with over 2.5 goals sees the odds rise to 13/10 (2.30) which could be of interest. Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+. begambleaware.org ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-vs-west-ham-predictions-odds-and-betting-tips/blt12cb9f24953f4c97,Phil Kitromilides,68a26b6f-2c56-41e8-b2bf-1e1fb3efa32b

"'Mbappe will be at PSG for a long time' - Real Madrid-linked striker already at 'best club in the world', insists Ronaldinho","Kylian Mbappe will be at Paris Saint-Germain ""for a long time"", according to Ronaldinho, who insists that the Real Madrid-linked striker is already at the ""best club in the world"". Mbappe has spent the last four years of his career at PSG but only has six months left to run on his current contract and talks over an extension have yet to progress. Madrid came close to signing the 23-year-old in the summer and have been tipped to return for his signature in 2022, but Ronaldinho sees him remaining at Parc des Princes for the foreseeable future. The Brazil legend, who played at PSG between 2001 and 2003 before going on to become one of the best players of his generation at Barcelona, has told the French club's official YouTube channel: ""All the players in the world want to play at Paris Saint-Germain, the best in the world are at PSG, so they're the best club in the world.  ""So I imagine he [Mbappe] will be here for a long time."" Ronaldinho added on Mbappe's chances of winning an elusive Champions League crown at PSG: ‚ÄúToday, Paris Saint-Germain is a world benchmark. It would be great for his career, he is so young and has already achieved so many things. ""I think the Champions League is something that he is missing. And it would be wonderful if he won it with Paris Saint-Germain. ""Everyone imagines that they have a chance to win the Champions League, because of the group of players they have."" Mbappe openly admitted that he wanted to join Madrid after missing out on a deadline day move to Santiago Bernabeu. However, the World Cup winner has since knuckled down and focused on his duties at PSG in impressive fashion, recording 15 goals and 15 assists in 24 appearances across all competitions. The Ligue 1 leaders are still working to try and tie Mbappe down to fresh terms, and he gave the clearest indication yet that he would be happy to stay put in an interview with Amazon Prime at the start of the month. ""Today I have to take the time. It is not easy. Either way, I'll be playing for a big club,"" he said of the speculation surrounding his future. ""At first I was disappointed [not to leave]. But, well, I am not in the third division, I am in a club that wants to win the Champions League. I am Parisian, I have my family, I feel good, I have always said it. I just wanted to discover something else.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-psg-long-time-real-madrid-linked-best-club-in-world/blt1e7a66b66380ed61,James Westwood,ca259eff-819d-481b-8050-49a7257d0746
Gomez delighted with Liverpool return after first Premier League start for 468 days,"Joe Gomez was delighted after making his first Premier League start for Liverpool in 468 days. Gomez played the full 90 minutes of Liverpool's 3-1 home win over Norwich on Saturday after being handed his first top-flight start since November 2020. The 24-year-old admits he has grown frustrated with his bit-part role in the squad this season, but was happy to finally see the reward for his hard work behind the scenes as the Reds moved to within six points of Manchester City at the top of the table. ‚ÄúObviously it‚Äôs been a moment I‚Äôve thought about for a long time,‚Äù Gomez told Liverpool's official website. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had to wait longer than I would have hoped, but at the end of the day I‚Äôve had to keep working and be the best member of the squad I can be, pushing the lads and doing my bit as well away from the pitch to try and be ready physically and mentally.¬† So yeah, it does mean a lot.‚Äù Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Ibrahima Konate are all currently ahead of Gomez in the central defender pecking order at Anfield, but he was able to step in at right-back against Norwich as Klopp opted to rest Alexander-Arnold. Gomez is not expecting to replace his fellow England international on a regular basis, and says he resisted the urge to try and copy his style of play. ""Obviously, I think Trent is in a world of his own and I‚Äôm not Trent, especially not at full-back,"" he added.  ""I think you have to come in with that mindset that you have to do what you do, and I don‚Äôt think the gaffer expects that [to emulate Alexander-Arnold].  ""Trent is a real playmaker for us and that sort of player in the team, but I have to believe in my own attributes and my own strengths and try and play to that. ""It would be easy to get caught up in that mentality and try and go above and beyond and do something that‚Äôs maybe not me.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gomez-liverpool-return-first-premier-league-start-468-days/blt215e74a890e507c4,James Westwood,02e3ade8-1b82-477a-9d47-ae00638ff088
Bryan Okoh: Salzburg's U.S.-born teenager out to become Europe's next defensive star,"At Red Bull Salzburg, the conveyor belt of attacking talent just keeps on turning. Sadio Mane, Erling Haaland and Patson Daka have all used the Austrian side as a gateway towards Europe's biggest leagues. Karim Adeyemi will follow them this summer, as will Brenden Aaronson, in all likelihood. Teenage talent Benjamin Sesko may well do the same in 2023. But at the other end of the pitch, Salzburg do not have an awful track record of nurturing defenders either. Dayot Upamecano came through the ranks at the Red Bull Arena before, four years after leaving for RB Leipzig, he became a ‚Ç¨42.5 million ($52m/¬£37m) signing for Bayern Munich. Duje Caleta-Car, meanwhile, spent three years in the Salzburg lineup during his early 20s before becoming a Liverpool target with his performances for Marseille, while Marin Pongracic is spending the season at Borussia Dortmund, having also plied his trade for the Austrian champions during his early career. That all bodes well, then, for the latest centre-back looking to break out at Salzburg, even if injury means his emergence has been put back a few months. Bryan Okoh is currently recuperating from a ruptured cruciate ligament suffered in November, an injury that will rule him out of action for the remainder of the 2021-22 campaign. That he suffered the injury while training with the Switzerland national team, having received his first call-up at the age of 18, should, however, illustrate just how much potential Okoh possesses. He has already made his Salzburg first-team debut, marking the occasion with a goal against lower-league Kalsdorf in September's Austrian Cup tie, and been on the bench for both Champions League and Bundesliga matches, too. A bright future beckons, then, for a player who was born in Houston, Texas to a Nigerian father and Congolese mother, meaning Okoh could represent four different teams at international level. He has opted for Switzerland, though, having spent the vast majority of his childhood living in the Romandy region on the west side of the European nation. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Okoh's first taste of formal football coaching came when he joined FC Espagnol Lausanne at the age of seven, before being enrolled into the academy at Swiss top-flight side Lausanne-Sport in 2016. He spent three years with the seven-time national champions, before Salzburg agreed to pay around ‚Ç¨2m to sign him as a 16-year-old in the summer of 2019, making him the most expensive Swiss player of his age in history. ""He had stood out with the national youth teams,"" ex-Lausanne sporting director, Pablo Iglesias, told 24 Heures, "" and the proposals were already coming from everywhere: English clubs, German teams, Italian sides and one in Austria. ""We tried to keep him. We met with his family, along with Bob Ratcliffe (Lausanne's owner), to offer him things so that he would stay, but it was too late."" Salzburg's scouting department had got them to the front of the queue for one of Europe's most sought-after youngsters once again, and he was immediately thrown into the club's reserve side, FC Liefering, who play in the second division of Austrian footballers. Okoh now has over 30 matches under his belt at that level, ensuring the 18-year-old will be ready for the rigours of the men's game once he returns to full fitness in the summer of 2022. So what marks Okoh out from other centre-backs of his age? ""He is very physical, he battles well and is strong in the duels,"" Mauro Lustrinelli, the manager of Switzerland Under-21s, told 24 Heures. ""He defends well, but as a bonus, he is good in the build-up phase, thanks to the fact that he is comfortable with both feet. That, for a modern player, is an incredible advantage.‚Äù That two-footedness and comfort in possession is something that scouts and coaches alike are desperate to have in their squads, meaning Okoh - who is not afraid to step out of defence and join in attacks - is likely to become a hot commodity in the coming years. He also has strong character traits; Iglesias described him as being ""polite, well-educated and has great family values. He is as strong on the field as he is at school."" All that adds up to Okoh being an elite talent, and one Salzburg are keen to continue moulding after handing the teenager a new four-year contract in the summer of 2021. ""I'm at Salzburg because they see something in me,"" Okoh told Tages-Anzeiger in October. ""I want to show that they are right about that."" As long as spells on the sidelines injured do not become the norm for Okoh, then he is well on the way to doing just that.

How Chelsea tried to sign their own player Emerson Palmieri for ¬£4m - and failed!,"Chelsea's primary focus in the January transfer window has been to replace Ben Chilwell, who has had to have surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament and is out for the season. Thomas Tuchel quickly decided that recalling Emerson Palmieri from his loan spell at Lyon was his best solution to fixing the problem. However, due to Lyon's agreement having no recall clause, Chelsea have had to negotiate to effectively re-sign him - and have been knocked back following protracted talks. Emerson is an Italy international who understands the demands of playing in Tuchel's team. He is also fully able to play as a left wing-back, while his attitude was seen as first class behind the scenes last season despite his fringe role in the squad. Tuchel even went public on his desire to see the Brazil-born defender return. ""We are looking into it because we now have a new situation with Ben Chilwell so of course, we look into whether we can do something and what we can do,"" he said on December 31. ""One of the possibilities and players we know and that we love as a person is Emerson, but we need to check. We are not into details. We are discussing and reflecting and this will go on for the coming days, maybe weeks."" The 27-year-old would have been happy to return, but is also appreciative that his loan has given him the chance to play regularly at a high level. Chelsea offered more than ¬£4 million ($5m) in compensation for breaking the agreement with the Ligue 1 club. However, manager Peter Bosz went public and said: ""We will keep Emerson."" Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has backed his coach by refusing approaches from Chelsea, knowing it will be hard for them to find a replacement of the same level. Chelsea were interested in Lucas Digne but stopped short of making any offers after it became clear that Aston Villa were willing to pay ¬£25m ($34M) for the former Everton defender. They have also been offered PSG's Layvin Kurzawa, but Tuchel isn't too excited about the option to bring him in. Sergino Dest is possibly the best option due to Barcelona's willingness to negotiate and reduce their wage commitments. He can also play on both sides with Reece James currently injured, although the England international has stepped up his recovery this week. With so much uncertainty around transfer targets, the Blues have opted to recall Kenedy who can play left wing-back, although he prefers to play in forward areas. He is effectively an insurance policy for the club after his underwhelming loan spell at Brazilian giants Flamengo.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-tried-to-sign-emerson-palmieri-failed/blt60c01561dadf0ffe,Nizaar Kinsella,3841bbb1-0865-408f-92f3-d6457f0a3852

From dreamland to a horror trilogy: Xavi's Barcelona honeymoon is well and truly over,"Routing Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Napoli, and others - Xavi Hernandez‚Äôs arrival catapulted Barcelona into dreamland. But over the course of April, they have lurched into a much darker place. They awoke screaming, after losing three games in a row at Camp Nou for the first time in the club‚Äôs history, with Xavi‚Äôs honeymoon well and truly period over. For better or worse, it has been a whirlwind start in the dugout for the former Barca midfielder, who compared the 4-0 hammering of Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu to a sci-fi flick, but also admitted there have been ‚Äúmoments of horror‚Äù. There were further cuts from the latter genre screened at Camp Nou last week, as Barca fell 1-0 to relegation-battling minnows Cadiz on Monday, and then lost by the same score against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. HIGHLIGHTS: #Bar√ßaRayo 0-1‚ö°Ô∏è @RayoVallecano get their second win of the season over Barcelona!#LaLigaSantander pic.twitter.com/hRgYf50sND More instalments lie ahead, with Mallorca, another side fighting for their lives, visiting Camp Nou this coming Sunday. The script they need to follow to beat Barcelona was written by both Cadiz and Rayo. A low block, organised time-wasting, rotating through different players going down injured or with cramp and stopping the game with repeated small fouls. The Blaugrana's downturn in form has put their hopes of a second-place finish, and even Champions League qualification, at risk. The performances against Cadiz, in particular, was as disappointing and stolid as the end of the Ronald Koeman era. The sheen of Barcelona‚Äôs form at the start of the year, going 15 games unbeaten, has vanished. ‚ÄúI understand it‚Äôs not as motivating for the fans and players to fight for second place,‚Äù said Xavi, ""but we have to be in the Champions League, we want to hear the Champions League music next season. ""We have to go into the games better. In the first half, we were not good. In the second better. We tried everything but the situation is difficult. I recognise as a coach that I made a mistake in not motivating them."" Losing at home against Eintracht Frankfurt was also a brutal blow, not just for their hopes of winning the Europa League, but also for the team‚Äôs morale, in a stadium filled with jubilant away fans who revelled in seeing their team go 3-0 up. Eintracht supporters snapped up tickets for the game at Camp Nou, with a reported 30,000 in attendance, filling the iconic Plaza Catalunya and singing their way to Les Corts. The club‚Äôs ‚Äògrada d‚Äôanimaci√≥‚Äô (singing stand) protested the club allowing so many visiting fans in by boycotting the clash with Cadiz, leaving a strange, hollow atmosphere inside the cavernous arena.¬† Although they returned against Rayo, the attendances for both games were in the mid 50,000s, figures put to shame by Barca Femeni, the club's women‚Äôs team. They have played twice at Camp Nou in the last few weeks, in the Women‚Äôs Champions League, with world-record attendances of over 90,000 there to see triumphant thrashings of Real Madrid and Wolfsburg, respectively. The Eintracht controversy also led to a club inquisition, where president Joan Laporta sought to blame some season-ticket holders who sold their passes and an archaic bookings system which got overloaded, without accepting much responsibility. On the pitch, Barca peaked at the Bernabeu before the international break and have suddenly run out of steam, similar to last season when they thrashed Real Sociedad at the same juncture and then threw away the title. Xavi has acknowledged that playing a high pressing game, something the club have not practised in recent years, has taken a toll on his players. Pedri‚Äôs injury has been a big problem, too. Xavi‚Äôs Barcelona hit full strength when the Canary Islander was at his effervescent best, running the show and feeding the forwards ahead of him, but he is now out for the rest of the campaign with a torn hamstring. From the moment he disappeared, the team deflated. Ansu Fati has also been missing, and his potential return as a substitute against Mallorca offers one glimmer of hope for the last five games of the season. The teenager raised morale at the club when he came back from injury against Levante in September, and the hope is he can do the same again. Xavi remarked with surprise upon his arrival that a lot of the players were not trained in Barcelona‚Äôs positional play, and that is still proving a challenge. Sergino Dest - another who is now out for the rest of the season due to injury - did not track Alvaro Garcia‚Äôs run well enough for Rayo‚Äôs goal, while Frenkie de Jong was substituted early after another poor performance. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, meanwhile, has been in resplendent goalscoring form but is struggling with hold-up play and control, which is a problem in a team that wants to keep the ball at all times. Against Real Sociedad on Thursday, Barca had less possession than their opponents, just scraping a 1-0 win thanks to profligate finishing from the Basques. There is a lot for Xavi to work on, both tactically and mentally, in what will be a long week in Catalunya before Mallorca arrive on Sunday, hoping to add a fourth horror film to Barca‚Äôs collection.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dreamland-horror-trilogy-xavi-barcelona-honeymoon-over/bltbbc7eebc563354f2,Rik Sharma,e2a7dec9-c402-4c00-b794-ae5a68aa6ce7
"Real Madrid fans whistling Bale is 'understandable', says Ancelotti after Wales star makes first Santiago Bernabeu appearance since February 2020","Gareth Bale was whistled by Real Madrid fans on his first appearance at Santiago Bernabeu since February 2020, and Carlo Ancelotti felt the reaction of the crowd was ""understandable"" given the winger's turbulent last few years at the club. Madrid took another big step towards the Liga title with a 2-0 victory over Getafe on Saturday, thanks to goals from Casemiro and Lucas Vazquez. Ancelotti threw Bale on for a rare cameo appearance late on, but he was greeted by a chorus of boos from a section of home supporters as he made his way onto the pitch. Bale didn't seem to be surprised by their reaction as he was seen smiling as the game restarted, and Ancelotti refused to condemn the Blancos fans in his post-match press conference. The Italian boss says the crowd will be crucial when Madrid welcome Chelsea to the Bernabeu for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, where they will be looking to hold onto a 3-1 aggregate lead. ‚ÄúI think that our fans are very important. They were against PSG [In the round of 16] and now we have them, that push, on Tuesday,"" Ancelotti told reporters. ""The whistle on Bale is understandable but he is doing well now.¬†He is a serious professional.‚Äù Bale has scored over 100 goals while winning four Champions League crowns and two La Liga titles during his nine-year spell with Madrid, having initally been snapped up from Tottenham in 2013. The 32-year-old has often seen his committment to the club called into question, though, with it reported that he spends most of his downtime playing golf rather than mixing with his team-mates. Bale famously held up a 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order' banner while away on international duty in 2019, and has since been reduced to a bit part role in the Blancos' squad. He was labelled a ""parasite"" by Spanish reporters earlier this year, but came out to defend himself during the last international break, while Ancelotti has insisted that he deserves to leave on a ""high note"" when his contract expires in June.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-fans-whistling-bale-is-understandable-says-ancelotti-/blte5b79e795321b94f,James Westwood,1946fa93-2a3b-493b-a9f3-35ae36b5a651
What is the women's football attendance record?,"Women's football is playing catch-up with the men's game, but positive strides have been made in recent years as investment and interest grows. The scale of the growth can be charted in attendances at fixtures and the world record for a women's game was smashed twice in 2022, with fans of Barcelona in particular helping to surpass a high-point that had stood for 23 years. So what is the record attendance for a women's football game? GOAL takes a look at the biggest sold-out games in the history of the sport. The world record attendance for a professional women's football match is 91,648.

"Chelsea & Man Utd-linked Rice worth more than ¬£150m, says West Ham boss Moyes","Declan Rice is worth more than ¬£150 million ($197m) to West Ham, per Irons boss David Moyes, who has reiterated that the England international is not for sale at London Stadium this summer. Midfielder Rice, who saw his stock hit new heights last summer after guiding the Hammers into Europe and then England to the final of Euro 2020, has only seen his reputation soar further this term, as his club make serious inroads into the Europa League. He is expected to be a key figure to the Three Lions' World Cup hopes at Qatar 2022 later this year too, but despite the interest of Chelsea and Manchester United among other big suitors, Moyes insists that West Ham will not sell, even at an eye-watering price. ""The first thing to say is that he is not for sale,"" Moyes told his pre-match press conference ahead of his side's clash with Everton. ""But if you are interested, it will be north of that, because ¬£100m ($131m) was cheap last summer and ¬£150m just now would be minimum - but he is not for sale."" ""I look at what Tottenham did with Harry Kane, albeit it in a different way. They said, 'no, there is a price and if someone wants to pay the price, then we'd probably do it. If they don't then he's not going anywhere'. That's it, they have kept him. ""There will be times when players have got the power, but at the moment we have got Declan on the best part of a three-and-a-half-year contract - just like Tottenham have got Harry Kane on a contract and they control what happens."" If West Ham intend to echo Tottenham's stance from last year, then the Hammers could be in for a protracted stand-off with their star man, particularly if Rice desires a move to find Champions League football. Spurs striker Kane famously wanted to move to Manchester City, only for a succession of big-money offers to be knocked back in north London. Rice however is likely to be more immediately focused on securing long-awaited silverware with West Ham, who face Lyon on Thursday in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-man-utd-rice-worth-more-than-gbp150m-west-ham-moyes/blt380abb8563437b11,Andrew Steel,84747504-4dd5-4689-979c-ccfd7b33b4b8
"Manchester United vs Norwich: Predictions, odds and betting tips","Manchester United are looking to maintain their fight for a spot in next season's Champions League when they host Norwich on Saturday. The Red Devils have fallen to six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham after picking up just one point from their last two matches. Norwich are bottom of the table, they have taken four points from their last two matches, but their hopes of avoiding relegation remain minimal. Manchester United are heavy favourites to win the Premier League clash, with bet365 pricing them at 2/9 (1.22). Norwich are big outsiders at 12/1 (13.0) to get the win in the tie. The draw is priced at 11/2 (6.5). Cristiano Ronaldo is the lowest priced player to open the scoring at 9/4 (3.25), while team-mate Marcus Rashford is available at 7/2 (4.5) Sadio Mane can be backed at 9/2 (5.5). At 11/1 (12.0) Teemu Pukki is the favourite Norwich player to break the deadlock against the Red Devils. United have been woefully inconsistent recently, having failed to string two wins together since mid-February. Their hopes of qualifying for next year's Champions League hang in the balance with Tottenham and Arsenal both ahead of them in the race. With games against Liverpool and Arsenal coming up, they need the three points in this clash to keep the dream alive. But Ralf Rangnick's team will have to make do without the likes of Fred, Edinson Cavani, Raphael Varane, Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay for this game. With United in dire need of the three points against the Premier League's bottom dwellers, you can expect them to come out fighting in this match so backing them to win with a -1 handicap at 4/6 (1.67) is a smart bet.

"'He transmits great joy!' - Vinicius Junior ready for limitless career, says ex-Real Madrid coach Solari","Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior is ready for takeoff on a limitless career, said former Blancos head coach Santiago Solari, who was at the Santiago Bernabeu during the player's first season in Spain in 2018. Solari identified the qualities that set the 22-year-old apart from his peers and has tipped him to do great things. Vinicius Junior enjoyed a 17-goal, 10-assist league campaign in 2021-22 as he established himself as one of Europe's premier attacking prospects. ""[His potential] only depends on him,"" Solari told Marca. ""He transmits great joy. That self-confidence, that desire to win and to go forward are many of the things that Madrid fans are passionate about. ""And he's also a fighter, he's not just talent. He has learned from all his coaches, for example in the defensive phase, and it shows. He works very hard, taking the ball and tackling, something that requires great strength, not only physically, but mentally and spiritually."" On what influence he may have had on the player's development, Solari added: ""If there is a little piece of me in what Vinicius has achieved, in the way he knocks on the door and wins the hearts of the people, it's wonderful, very nice.""

Lewandowski sets new Champions League record against Salzburg with fastest hat-trick in competition history,"Robert Lewandowski wasted no time in putting RB Salzburg to the sword on Tuesday, as he netted three times for Bayern Munich to set a new Champions League record for the fastest hat-trick in the competition's history. The 2019-20 champions went into the second leg with the tie poised at 1-1. But thanks to Lewandowski, any fears of an upset were dispelled in rapid fashion. The Poland star needed just 12 minutes to get his name on the scoresheet, converting a penalty to put his side up 1-0 on the night and 2-1 on aggregate. And nine minutes later he was on target again from the spot, before completing his hat-trick within a mere 120 seconds of returning to the centre-circle. In total Lewandowski needed just 23 minutes from kick-off to reach three, making Champions League history. 23 - Robert Lewandowski has completed a hat-trick within 23 minutes against FC RB Salzburg tonight; the earliest treble ever scored by a player in UEFA Champions League history from the start of a match, overtaking Marco Simone for Milan v Rosenborg in 1996 (24 mins). Snappy. pic.twitter.com/aVNNmGdgVV He is now the fastest hat-trick scorer ever in the competition, beating Marco Simone's previous mark. Serge Gnabry then hit the net to complete a torrid spell for Salzburg and put Bayern's presence in the quarters beyond doubt even before the half-time whistle had sounded. Tuesday's haul additionally restored Lewandowski's position as the Champions League's top scorer in 2021-22. He now has 12 goals in this year's competition, one ahead of Sebastien Haller, who has enjoyed a stunning campaign so far for Ajax. In total the Pole boasts 42 goals in 35 games in all competitions for Bayern, an incredible strike-rate and one which leaves him well-placed to surpass the 48 he managed for the Bavarians last term.

"Juventus vs Torino: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Juventus welcome Torino to the Allianz Stadium on Friday night for the second Turin derby of the Serie A season. The last meeting between these cross-city rivals came in October when Juve scored late on to snatch a 1-0 win and Max Allegri's side will be hoping for three more points to keep pace with league leaders AC Milan. Juventus have not lost a derby in their own stadium this century and the hosts are offered at 3/5 (1.60) with bet365 to continue their dominance in this fixture with a win. Torino, meanwhile, come into the clash in 10th place in the table following successive defeats and are priced at 11/2 (6.50) with the draw available at 11/4 (3.75). Dusan Vlahovic has already netted his first goal for Juve following his January move from Fiorentina and the Serbian striker is the shortest priced player to break the deadlock at 3/1 (4.00). Elsewhere, Alvaro Morata and Paulo Dybala are both offered at 7/2 (4.50), while Torino's Italy international Andrea Bellotti is available at 6/1 (7.00). It has been a difficult season for Juve yet their home form has improved in the last couple of months with the side recording four wins and a draw from their last five home league matches. They have also shored things up defensively, as their four home wins since December have all come without conceding and they should feel confident about keeping things tight against a Torino team with a poor attacking record on the road. Ivan Juric's men have failed to score in six of their last eight away matches in Serie A and have lost away from home to Milan, Inter, Napoli, Roma and Fiorentina. Backing Juve, therefore, to come out on top makes plenty of sense with Torino's away form leaving a lot to be desired.

'Barca changed the game but Lyon was here first' - Inside OL's Women's Champions League comeback,"As players sprinted onto the pitch from the Paris Saint-Germain bench, overjoyed and ecstatic, there was a striking contrast with the way in which their Lyon counterparts slowly walked through the pandemonium. The seven-time European champions had just suffered their first Women‚Äôs Champions League exit in seven years and only their fifth ever defeat to their arch-rivals. But while setbacks of this nature often result in those on the losing side falling to the ground, unable to hold back the tears, on this occasion, there was more a steely look of acceptance in the eyes of those leaving the pitch of the empty Groupama Stadium. They knew it wasn‚Äôt good enough. Some predicted that this result would be the beginning of the end for the greatest dynasty in women‚Äôs football ‚Äì and one of the greatest in sporting history. With the league title also surrendered to PSG, it would be OL‚Äôs first trophyless season since 2006. But those who did write off this team certainly look foolish now. UWCL final stream links üëá English - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonEN Spanish - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonES French - https://bit.ly/BarcelonaLyonFR This weekend, Lyon are back in the UWCL final and in search of a victory that would extend their record as the continent‚Äôs most successful women‚Äôs team. Yes, last season didn‚Äôt go to plan, but it‚Äôll take more than that to take down a club like this. When GOAL asks Janice Cayman, the Lyon full-back who spent eight years playing for rival teams in France, what it was like to play against the club before she joined, her response is telling: ‚ÄúWe called them a machine."" ‚ÄúThey were so good with the passing, positioning, and it was just wave after wave coming,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúAt some point, you know you're going to mess up somewhere and they're going to score and then it's even harder to stop them. ‚ÄúI was really looking forward to having that feeling being in Lyon, to be kind of invincible.‚Äù Invincible ‚Äì that‚Äôs the reputation this club and these players have. Captain Wendie Renard has won seven Champions League titles and made more appearances in the competition than any other player. Sarah Bouhaddi, Eugenie Le Sommer and Amel Majri all have seven winners‚Äô medals too, with Delphine Cascarino, Ada Hegerberg and Amandine Henry not far behind on five. They‚Äôre not used to being the team watching another celebrate, that‚Äôs for sure. ‚ÄúIt was rough,‚Äù Cayman remembers. ‚ÄúWe asked ourselves a lot of questions. We know we have the quality and the good players, but for some reason it didn‚Äôt match 100 per cent on the field.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think, if anything, it served as extra fuel for us this year,‚Äù Catarina Macario, the U.S. women‚Äôs national team forward who arrived early last year, tells GOAL. ‚ÄúIt was like, 'Alright, we were nowhere close to where we wanted to be, or what OL is used to in their history', and so we knew that we really needed to take it up a few notches. ‚ÄúBut not only that, it showed that other teams are catching up. We're no longer the only team to be beat. There are a lot of other teams that are really putting in investment and have really talented players in their squad. ‚ÄúIt just means that we have to be even better than ever before. We took that almost like with a grain of salt, like, 'Alright, now the fight is back on'. That's what's been cool about this year, because we're fighting for something, you know? ‚ÄúIt's been really cool to be a part of and to be in this new transitional period of the team and of trying to regain our European title.‚Äù The use of the possessive perfectly sums up the dominance Lyon has enjoyed in Europe over the past decade ‚Äì but last season they would have to watch another team, Barcelona, lift the trophy. The last time they did that, in 2015, it was motivating. Two years in a row, they went out in the last 16 and, two years in a row, they had to watch the latter rounds of the competition from the comfort of their own homes. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to watch it again on my TV. I want to play these games‚Äô,‚Äù Le Sommer said of that barren period in an interview with GOAL back in 2020. ‚ÄúIt was a motivation for me, it was for the team too. This experience made us better and stronger in our mentality.‚Äù Barcelona Femeni v Lyon.The Women's Champions League is set üçø pic.twitter.com/jUb2m9cdOn After that came five successive titles. That‚Äôs telling of the mentality and resilience within these players. With that in mind, those at the club always knew that the response this season would be as good as it has been. ‚ÄúNo one was happy with how last season ended,‚Äù Macario explains. ‚ÄúEven if we had won, we weren't playing good football. ""We wanted to use that as an extra motivation for us this year. The unhappiness and dissatisfaction from last year has definitely carried over.‚Äù But it is not just because of this motivation that Lyon are back in the final, nor is it only down to the squad‚Äôs insane mentality or world-class quality. It is all of this and more. In the aftermath of last season‚Äôs elimination, head coach Jean-Luc Vasseur was replaced with Sonia Bompastor. The 41-year-old has brought a lot of qualities to the role, but her experience of playing for Lyon and winning titles at the club is particularly special. ‚ÄúShe's been in our situation,‚Äù Cayman says of Bompastor. ‚ÄúShe knows sometimes the pressure is high as well. She was a very good player, and a very intense player, always giving it her all ‚Äì a captain.‚Äù For Damaris Egurrola, the Netherlands midfielder, Camille Abily‚Äôs presence is also very important. ‚ÄúEvery time she talks to me and tries to correct stuff, I'm really aware of it because I think she has been one of the best midfielders here in France and Lyon also,‚Äù she tells GOAL. ‚ÄúShe was someone that I used to look up to and now she's the assistant coach, trying to help me perform and be better every day. I just try to learn every day from them. ‚ÄúThey've been here a long time, also in the academies. They know how all the young girls work. They've been playing in this league for a long time, so they know all the teams, all the stadiums. ""In that sense, I think we prepared really well for the season because of their experience. That's really helpful for us.‚Äù The integration of some of those young talents ‚Äì such as Alice Sombath, the teenage defender who ranked at No.6 in this year‚Äôs NXGN list ‚Äì is promising for this club‚Äôs future. But it‚Äôs the return of some of their most established stars that has been a particularly significant factor in this season‚Äôs success. Neither Griedge Mbock Bathy ‚Äì as reliable a centre-back as one could possibly hope to find ‚Äì nor Ada Hegerberg, recipient of the 2018 Ballon d‚ÄôOr, played a single minute of football last season due to injury. Their comebacks have been huge. ‚ÄúThose are two key players,‚Äù Cayman says. ‚ÄúIt's very sad to see them not being able to play, but then when they get back, I think it's double the pleasure to see them doing what they're good at.‚Äù For Macario, one of the most promising young forwards in the world, to finally get to build that relationship with Hegerberg is big. Their link-up has been one of the most exciting things about Lyon this year. ‚ÄúShe's not the greatest goalscorer in the history of the Champions League for nothing, you know? She's one of the best players in the world for a reason,‚Äù Macario laughs. ‚ÄúHaving her back helps a lot! ‚ÄúIt's not a one-person game ‚Äì but she's Ada Hegerberg. She has a big presence on and off the pitch. In the locker room, she's almost like Wendie. ‚ÄúWendie's a big captain, she's our captain. She's a big leader but Ada is definitely there with her in giving us that hype speech, in telling us, 'Hey, this is what we need to do', making sure that we all feel confident when stepping onto the pitch. ‚ÄúShe is a big person that we definitely missed and it's so, so good to have her back. This is where she belongs and this is where OL belongs, too. This is what it's supposed to be like.‚Äù Ada Hegerberg silenced the Parc des Princes ü•∂ pic.twitter.com/2OVCaieYTJ We are back to that familiar tale now of Lyon being in the final, but it‚Äôs a little different this time around because, for some, OL is not the favourite this weekend. It‚Äôs Barcelona ‚Äì the reigning European champions, the team that just completed a perfect season in Spain‚Äôs domestic league, the team that has taken all of Lyon‚Äôs plaudits over the past 12 months. The French giants have long been considered the benchmark, but now Barca are being talked of as the example, of being the best. That‚Äôs another thing adding fuel to Lyon‚Äôs fire. ""There was women's football before Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand it was played here for years,‚Äù Hegerberg told L‚ÄôEquipe earlier this month. ‚ÄúWe have to win again to regain our place in world football. We have the chance to do it this season. We have never lost against Barcelona."" It‚Äôs a feeling shared within the group. ‚ÄúI totally agreed when Ada said this,‚Äù Egurrola says. ‚ÄúWith all respect for Barcelona, I think they changed the game in Spain. Everyone is crazy about them and it's really something that we need to give importance [to]. ‚ÄúThey changed all the mentality of the people, all the crowd and everyone's reporting on Barcelona and Spain and that's really cool. Also, for us, it's a big change in women's football, that they came so strong. ‚ÄúBut on the other side, I also think what Ada said, in the years before, Lyon was also here. They've been champions for the last 10 years and we don't have to forget that.‚Äù Barca certainly will not have forgotten as much. After all, they were on the wrong end of a 4-1 thumping in the 2019 final. They will see Saturday as a chance to get some revenge. But Lyon have that opportunity too. After PSG got the better of them last season, they thrust a dagger in their hearts at the Parc des Princes in the semi-finals, winning 2-1 to secure their ticket to Turin in front of the biggest crowd ever to watch the Parisians. Now, they can wrestle back their status as European champions from the team that took it from them. ‚ÄúWe're really happy with how the season has gone,‚Äù Egurrola says, ‚Äúbut the best part is yet to come. We can't wait.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barca-lyon-story-behind-ol-women-champions-league-comeback/blta4a9018440faf514,Ame√© Ruszkai,303e81c2-ad60-40f8-927b-7ee6d94e114e
"Europa Conference League Wrap: Sor, Olayinka, Traore & El Kaddouri score","Slavia Prague played out a 3-3 away draw at Feyenoord in Thursday‚Äôs Europa Conference League quarter-final first leg fixture, with Yira Sor, Peter Olayinka and Ibrahim Traore all finding the net for the Czech First League outfit.¬† Both teams went into the game full of confidence having stayed unbeaten in their last two matches in all competitions. Nevertheless, it was the Eredivisie side that took the lead after ten minutes. Luis Sinisterra collected the ball on the edge of the area from Reiss Nelson before unleashing a stunning effort past goalkeeper Ondrej Kolar. That goal was a reality check for the visitors who almost levelled matters five minutes later, but goalkeeper Ofir Marciano made a good save to deny Nigeria‚Äôs Sor. Four minutes before the half-time break, Olayinka drew the Red and Whites back to level terms - reacting to a rebounded effort and fired it into the back of the net.¬† Former Nigeria youth international Sor put Slavia Prague ahead in the 67th minute after latching onto a through ball from Ivan Schranz.¬† That lead was short-lived and five minutes later Marcos Senesi made no mistake from point-blank range thanks to an assist from Nigeria‚Äôs Cyriel Dessers. The Club on the Meuse thought they had completed a turnaround in the 74th minute when Orkun Kokcu put them in front again. But a last-gasp leveller from Cote d‚ÄôIvoire international Ibrahim Traore gave Jindrich Trpisovsky‚Äôs team something to cheer about. The reverse fixture takes place on April 14 a the Sinobo Stadium with the winners on aggregate qualifying for the last four.¬† At the Stade Velodrome, Morocco international Omar El Kaddouri got a goal for PAOK FC yet the Greek side bowed 2-1 to Olympique Marseille.¬† An impressive first half saw the French team take a two-goal lead through Gerson and Dimitri Payet.

USMNT boss Berhalter explains decision to start Zardes over Pepi against Canada,"U.S. men's national team boss Gregg Berhalter said it was an ""easy decision"" to start Gyasi Zardes over Ricardo Pepi against Canada on Sunday. The U.S. suffered a 2-0 loss to their northern neighbors, who capitalized on limited chances with goals from Cyle Larin and Sam Adekugbe to take a huge step towards a spot at the World Cup. The U.S., meanwhile, struggled to generate chances and, more importantly, goals as they fell to a defeat. After starting Jesus Ferreira at striker in the 1-0 win over El Salvador on Thursday, Berhalter went with another surprise starter up top on Sunday by turning to the veteran Zardes. As a result, Pepi, who many see as the USMNT's striker of the future, was relegated to the bench before entering as a substitute in the 69th minute. The U.S. dominated possession with 64 percent and fired 13 shots to Canada's eight but, ultimately, were unable to break down the hosts. ""We know that generally we create chances for our striker with our game model,"" Berhalter said, ""and we believe that we have quality guys that can finish them off. Scoring goals is the hardest thing to do, but I'm confident that the group was going to get it right.  ""We have another opportunity on Wednesday to work on that but to me its not an issue. I think we look at the whole team. We look at the whole team of how we're moving the ball and how we're getting into dangerous areas."" Berhalter went on to explain the decision to start Zardes, whom he felt gave the U.S. the best chance to create a goal on a narrow, turf field in frigid Hamilton, Ontario. ""That was an easy one,"" he said. ""We knew what the game was going to look like. We knew it was a very narrow field, a small field. We know it's going to be a very physical game and we thought that Gyasi would give us that physicality. ""From looking at his performance, I think he did that. I don't think we got him enough service in the box to get him dangerous."" He continued: ""We'll pick the best striker that we think can get the job done in that particular game, so it will be a gameplan-specific striker now.  ""Ricardo is a player that just went over to Germany, he's just breaking in there, and I'm sure he's going to have a long run with the national team and it's just about getting him confidence and getting him game time at the highest level and I think he'll eventually do that.  ""With Jesus and Gyasi, they're not in season yet so it's hard to really see the form that they're in to say, 'Okay, this is the guy who's going to be leading the line for three games in a row'.  ""So part of it is gameplan-specific and part of it is the form of our strikers.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-boss-berhalter-explains-decision-to-start-zardes-over-pepi-/bltf0e321ba353e6591,Ryan Tolmich,39b25a01-e9ec-4bb1-bac8-705abe23df91
Brighton teammates predicted my goal against Arsenal - Mwepu,"Enock Mwepu revealed his Brighton & Hove Albion teammates predicted his goal before the start of the Arsenal game. Fuelled by his inspiring display at the Emirates Stadium, the Zambian contributed a goal and an assist as the Seagulls tamed the Gunners 2-1 before their home fans. Having provided the last pass for Leandro Trossard‚Äôs opener in the 28th minute, Mwepu sealed the win with his second-half effort.¬† Moises Caicedo dug the ball back from the byline to his teammate on the edge of the box, and the Zambian international fired first-time into the bottom corner of goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The delighted midfielder is on cloud nine following the strike - his second of the 2021-22 campaign - and he talked about how his colleagues foresaw that he would find the net against Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side.¬† ‚ÄúWe had a little joke in the dressing room before the game that I was going to score. I was delighted to take the chance, I hit it really well and it was wonderful to see it go into the net,‚Äù Mwepu told the club website.¬† ¬†‚ÄúI am so glad, we needed the three points after six losses and a draw but I think we have shown that we have the right mentality in the group to can come to places like Arsenal and play like we did. ‚ÄúWe just want to continue in the final games like this, play well and win for the coach, who has shown a lot of confidence in us.‚Äù With the hosts pulling a goal back in the 89th minute through Martin Odegaard, the tone was set for a tense closing stage as Arsenal were in dire need of a late equaliser. This fuelled fear in the mind of the former Red Bull Salzburg star: ‚ÄúI almost wasn‚Äôt breathing!‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI just wanted the game to end but we defended so well and it was just great to win the game and then celebrate in front of our fans.‚Äù While Mwepu was subbed off for Tariq Lamptey in the 77th minute, Mali international Yves Bissouma was replaced four minutes earlier by Adam Lallana. Whereas, England-born centreback of Nigerian descent Odel Offiah was an unused substitute in the encounter.¬† Having been involved in his team‚Äôs five goals in his last five Premier League games (1 goal, 4 assists), the Zambian would be aiming to replicate his inspiring form against Tottenham Hostpur on April 16.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/brighton-teammates-predicted-my-goal-against-arsenal-mwepu/blt35b774c4d5a81e97,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,d770ceb0-47c1-46e1-b524-2054b19d2a09
Dembele matches Benzema and Messi in assist charts as calls for Barcelona man to stay grow louder,"Ousmane Dembele has matched Karim Benzema and Lionel Messi in the European assist charts as calls for the Barcelona man to stay at Camp Nou grow louder. Dembele has enjoyed an impressive run of form since returning to Xavi's line-up in February, playing a key role in Barca's rise to second in La Liga and progression to the latter stages of the Europa League. The 24-year-old registered his 11th assist of the season during their latest match against Levante, finding Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang with a pinpoint cross to open the scoring as the Blaugrana went on to win the contest 3-2. Dembele is now top of the Liga assist charts alongside Real Madrid's Benzema with 11 this season. Nine of Dembele's assists have come since the turn of the year, a number that can only be equalled by Barca legend Messi in 2022 as he has become a regular provider for his Paris Saint-Germain team-mates in Ligue 1. 9 - FC Barcelona's Ousmane Demb√©l√© has provided the most assist in the Top 5 European Leagues in the 2022 year (nine, alongside Lionel Messi).

"Van de Beek experience may put Ten Hag off joining Man Utd, claims Neville","Gary Neville has claimed Donny van de Beek's experience at Old Trafford may put Erik ten Hag off joining Manchester United. GOAL has reported Ajax boss Ten Hag is now the number one candidate to become United's next permanent manager, with the final details of his contract being worked on behind the scenes. It has been reported the Dutchman wants certain assurances before he commits to the Red Devils who have slipped to seventh in the Premier League, and Neville is concerned that Van de Beek could influence his final decision. Van de Beek played under Ten Hag at Johan Cruyff ArenA for three years before joining United for ¬£35 million ($45m) in 2020, but has failed to prove his worth in Manchester. The 24-year-old was sent out on loan to Everton in January, and Neville doesn't think he would give the club a glowing endorsement in any conversations with Ten Hag. ""If you look at what Manchester United are doing to players, there isn't one who has grown. Look at what they did to Donny van de Beek,"" The United legend has said on his Sky Sports podcast. ""If you're Ten Hag, I think you're on the phone to Van de Beek. What's it like there, Donny? He's not saying anything good, is he?"" United appeared to be heading in the right direction after a runners up finish in the Premier League under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020-21, but he was sacked last November after a poor start to the current campaign. Ralf Rangnick was brought in to the steady the ship on an interim basis, but the Red Devils have since exited all major cup competitions while falling six points off the pace in the race for a top-four finish. Neville believes Ten Hag is now taking steps to ensure that he avoids a similar fate to Solskjaer and his predecessors. He said: ""I suspect Ten Hag's demands aren't financial, they will be about control, recruitment, structure, youth. I suspect he wants to come in and make sure he's not exposed to what other managers have been exposed to in these last 10 years. ""That might be too much for Manchester United, and I suspect it may be a difficult week or two for the club. I still think they will get it over the line, but the reports this morning were that Ten Hag was placing demands on the club that maybe go above and beyond.

Vela sends Bale LAFC warning: 'He will have to come to work',"Gareth Bale will ""have to come to work"" if he wants to make a success of his new start in MLS, warns Los Angeles FC forward Carlos Vela, as his new team-mate prepares for life in California. The former Real Madrid attacker turned down a stay in Europe to move stateside as a free agent, joining former Italy skipper Giorgio Chiellini as a major signing for Steve Cherundolo's club, weeks after guiding Wales to the 2022 World Cup. But Vela, one of LAFC's star performers this term, says the veteran attacker cannot expect an easy ride, and must be prepared to put the hard work in to earn his place when he starts training. ""If he comes in with a good mentality, with a good attitude, he will be really important because he‚Äôs a big player,"" Vela told a press conference when asked about what impact Bale can bring. ""He‚Äôs coming from Real Madrid, so I think I don‚Äôt have to talk much about him because everybody knows how good he is.

After a slew of successful silverware pursuits with Madrid, it is likely the forward will have his eyes on more trophies after linking up with LAFC, who are among the frontrunners to go all the way to the MLS Cup at the end of the campaign. But if anything, the most important thing for the attacker will be ensuring he is match-fit and ready for Qatar at the end of the season, as Wales prepare for a first World Cup campaign since 1958.

'They are lost completely' - Former Man Utd coach Meulensteen slams club amid worst ever Premier League season,"Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has slammed the club amid their worst ever Premier League season, insisting they are now ""lost completely"". Man Utd are set to post their lowest-ever points tally at the end of the 2021-22 campaign, with a 4-0 defeat at Brighton leaving them in sixth place on 58 points. The previous lowest mark of 64 was set under David Moyes in 2013-14, which the Red Devils can no longer surpass given they have only one game remaining with interim boss Ralf Rangnick, who will make way for Ajax's Erik ten Hag in the summer. Man Utd are now destined to drop into either the Europa or Conference League and have extended their recent trophy drought to five seasons - a far cry from the success they enjoyed when Meulensteen was sitting in the dugout with Sir Alex Ferguson. The Dutchman helped the club win three Premier League titles and the Champions League between 2007 and 2013, and has been shocked by how far they have fallen since last season's runners' up finish. Meulensteen thought Cristiano Ronaldo's return from Juventus would spark a title challenge, and told talkSPORT: ‚ÄúThere were a lot of expectations, even from myself. When Ronaldo comes in, he comes in for one reason only and that‚Äôs to improve the team and basically get Man Utd challenging again. ‚ÄúThey were second in the league, so no reason to believe anything else. For some reason there was that lack of consistency at the start of the season and performances started to fall away.¬† ‚ÄúThe season has been derailed more and more. You saw the frustration kick in when they got knocked out of this competition, then they got knocked out of the FA Cup, then they lost ground in the league. They changed managers again and Rangnick came in. ‚ÄúRangnick‚Äôs impact has not brought what everyone expected, to push for the top four and Champions League is so important. They have been derailed and irritation has turned into frustration. ‚ÄúWhen I see Man Utd play, I see a team that is lost. They are lost completely. There is no cohesion, no organisation, no structure, any basic thing that you need in any successful performance is not there.‚Äù Rumours of discontent in the United dressing room have been constant in recent months, as has talk of certain players undermining Rangnick while refusing to give their all in training and matches. Meulensteen says a lack of commitment from star names has played a key role in the squad's poor form as ""pride"" has gone out of the window at Old Trafford. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is when you do sign for a club is to represent them with pride. We know some players that have come in have never really committed to the club,"" he added. ‚ÄúThen you get these rumours fed in through the media that ‚Äòhe‚Äôs not happy‚Äô and this player or that player wants to go. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got a very solid dressing room and those players in the dressing room want to be there together, they want to do well together and fight for each other. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got people in there who don‚Äôt really want to be there then you feel that.

'We were cheering in the restaurant!' - Chelsea academy graduate Houghton relishing Stamford Bridge return,"Jordan Houghton will finally get to make an appearance in a senior game at Stamford Bridge after Plymouth were paired with Chelsea in the FA Cup fourth round. When the draw was made on January 9, the Blues academy graduate celebrated wildly. Although he hasn't hit the heights of many of his former Cobham colleagues, he has since established himself as one of the best midfielders in League One and he is viewed as another success story in west London. The Blues' under-age coaching team know that not all of the youngsters that come through the academy will end up playing at the very highest level, like Mason Mount and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Therefore, they simply want to offer the best possible education to ensure as many graduates as possible excel in football or other fields. Houghton will, thus, be given a warm welcome when he returns to the Bridge on Saturday and Houghton himself can't wait to step out onto the pitch for the first time since leaving Chelsea on a permanent basis four years ago. ""I was out for dinner with my wife and streaming the draw on my phone,"" a beaming Houghton tells GOAL. ""It was obviously lagged because, all of a sudden, I was getting messages through with emojis! ""I thought it was someone big but no one actually said it was Chelsea. Chelsea eventually came out and we were cheering in the restaurant. ""Everyone was looking at us thinking 'What are they doing?' Honestly, it's the best draw for me. I wanted Chelsea away. ""I won Youth Cups, the Milk Cup and loads of trophies there. I developed there while meeting loads of brilliant coaches, loads of brilliant players and people. ""I would have liked a professional appearance, but I was lucky to play in friendlies with a lot of first team boys and go away with them on a couple of tours. ""So, I'm grateful for those opportunities. I want to win but I have no negative feelings towards the club. ""Chelsea was the Oxford or Cambridge of football. I'm pleased to have gone through that."" Indeed, in one pre-season friendly with Jose Mourinho's Blues, Houghton lined up alongside Eden Hazard, John Terry, Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic. However, his fondest memory remains the Champions League trophy parade in 2012, when Chelsea's academy players were added to the senior party in recognition of their own FA Youth Cup success. ""The Youth Cup was the World Cup at that age and the pinnacle for an under-18 player,"" he added. ""It was a brilliant achievement to win it. ""I've got a few shirts framed in my house and one of them is my youth cup top signed by all the lads with my medal. You look at the names who signed it and all went on to do something in the game. ""[Ruben] Loftus-Cheek was with me through from Under-9s in midfield and he was always a top player. ""He was physically excellent, with great running power and strength, but he also has good technique. He can glide past players and has quick feet for a big guy. ""Andreas Christensen came in at 15, 16 and he was another top, top player who oozed class and calmness. A very quiet lad but you don‚Äôt need to be bellowing or shouting to be a top player. ""In that team, we had Tammy Abraham and Dom Solanke scoring all the goals. But the one who always stuck out for me was Charly Musonda; he was probably the best in terms of wow factor. ""He had quick feet and would do things no one else could do. It‚Äôs such a shame that he has had a tough time with injuries and is due to leave in the summer. It is disappointing to see. ""He did come close at one point after coming back on loan, making a few appearances and then getting injured. ""Jeremie [Boga] was always, from 14, 15, one of the best players. He had that wow factor of dribbling past players effortlessly. ""You always knew he‚Äôd reach the top and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he joins a Barcelona in a few years because that‚Äôs the kind of player that he is. ""I played a bit with Mount and Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi, who were in the age groups below and trained with Romelu Lukaku, of course. ""It's like Man United's class of 92. We then got to tour behind the Champions League-winning squad and I always remember Drogba going on the mic and yelling 'Beep, beep', with a crowd of 100,000 fans going wild. ""Soon after that, I was on a post-season tour of Thailand and Australia with the first team. Mourinho was the manager at the time. ""It was great to see how he worked. When I was at MK Dons, we had a friendly at Spurs and he came over and said: 'Hello, how are you doing?' He was asking how I was getting on and telling me to keep going."" Mourinho was right. There's more to come for Houghton, who has since gone on to make more than 100 appearances in League One, across spells with Gillingham, Doncaster, MK Dons and Plymouth. Now, he and his Pilgrims team-mates are pushing for promotion to the Championship, which has long been one of Houghton's dreams. ""I feel like I've accomplished quite a lot already in my career, but that's the one thing I want,"" the 26-year-old admits. ""I haven't had the opportunity to play in the Championship yet but I think I can do it. I just need that opportunity to prove it. ""So, that's the aim for me and the club: to get there this season.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-academy-graduate-houghton-stamford-bridge-return/bltf90b31b9e069bbe5,Nizaar Kinsella,455dfe68-30c0-4c50-a820-22f11b45973d

Aubameyang reveals jaw injury from 'violent cowards' robbing home,"WHAT HAPPENED? The Barcelona striker has confirmed he was attacked at his home and threatened in front of his family after the team's win over Real Valladolid on Sunday. Aubameyang suffered a jaw injury but is confident he will recover quickly. WHAT HE SAID: ""On Sunday night, some violent cowards broke into our home and threatened my family and my children, just to steal some stuff. They injured my jaw but I will recover in no time and thank God no one else was physically harmed,‚Äù he wrote on Instagram and Twitter. ""The feeling that we are no longer safe in our own home is hard to understand and described, but as a family, we will overcome this and stand stronger than ever."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: The incident comes amid intense speculation about Aubameyang's Barcelona future in the final days of the transfer window. Chelsea are in talks with the 33-year-old striker but yet to agree a deal with the Catalan giants. IN ONE PHOTO: Aubameyang hopes to be back in action quickly but it's not clear yet where he will spend the rest of the season. WHAT NEXT FOR AUBAMEYANG?

Rivals? Chelsea justify Hayes' dismissal of Arsenal as Women's FA Cup triumph seals treble win,"‚ÄúPlaying against Arsenal as Chelsea manager is always a great game for us,‚Äù Emma Hayes told the press before Sunday‚Äôs Women‚Äôs FA Cup final against the Gunners. ‚ÄúBut it has never been our rival game. Manchester City has always been that. ‚ÄúThis is a London derby so it's slightly different. There's a lot more fan involvement, press interest, but I've always thought the bigger game was us versus Man City over the years.‚Äù It‚Äôs the type of quote that could have become infamous, one to fire up the opponent just days before the showpiece event at Wembley in front of a record crowd. In the end, the Gunners didn‚Äôt show too many glimpses of making Hayes eat her words. Chelsea were ruthless from the off, the frantic nature of the game suiting their transitional style best as only Arsenal goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger stopped them putting the game to bed before half-time. In the end, her efforts were in vain as the Blues emerged 3-0 winners. Arsenal didn‚Äôt have a shot on target all game. Chelsea had eight and hit the woodwork a further two times. Treble winners üèÜüîµ pic.twitter.com/eQnE6nMsfv With this the final from last season‚Äôs competition, due to Covid-19 disruptions, it doesn‚Äôt only make Chelsea FA Cup winners either. Indeed, after their league and Continental Cup triumphs, it makes them treble winners. In the latter competition, Arsenal were knocked out in the group stage. In the league, they finished third, nine points off the top. After the Gunners‚Äô 3-2 win over the Blues at the Emirates to kick off the season, and their unbeaten league form that has them top of the Women‚Äôs Super League table, they are certainly making progress after a couple of difficult years under former coach Joe Montemurro. However, this game showed that those who doubted the significance of that result on the opening weekend had a point. With Sam Kerr and Fran Kirby among those on the Chelsea bench, after long summers with their national teams, the Blues weren‚Äôt at full strength. With ‚ÄòKerrby‚Äô on the pitch at Wembley, it was quite a different story. First goal ‚Äì it was Kerr‚Äôs play that caused disruption in the Arsenal defence so Kirby could score. Second goal ‚Äì it was Kirby‚Äôs pass that set Kerr free, and she did the rest. With Kirby substituted off when Kerr put away the third, it was just all about the Aussie‚Äôs skill, as she scooped the ball over Zinsberger to seal it. ""That was Fran's best game in a Chelsea shirt,"" Hayes said after the game. ""I thought she ran the show. She got on the ball in dangerous situations, she threaded Sam in on numerous occasions, but also herself was a real threat, a real handful throughout the game. ""I think Sam Kerr, so many wondered how she would handle the English game. As far as I'm concerned she's the best striker in the world and she displayed that when it mattered most. ""She's courageous. She's full of confidence. She can do that after getting off a plane from Sydney, Australia, on Thursday. ""She's a superb athlete, an amazing human, and they are two of many, many characters in this dressing room that are noteworthy for their performances today. ""The second goal was critical in the game. That was so vital just to calm any anxiety or nerves that might have existed. But I don‚Äôt think my team played like that today. ""I think everything they did was decisive, was collective, coherent, champion-like. I've said it in recent press conferences, I think we're getting better. I really do."" That‚Äôs outrageous! ü§Ø@samkerr1 with an incredible chip over Zinsberger üçü@ChelseaFCW #WomensFACupFinal pic.twitter.com/uFEDQlSVbG Arsenal were not at full strength themselves for this final. Leah Williamson was missing, which was a huge absence in central defence, where Kerr and Kirby wreaked havoc. But this was still a team with stars. Vivianne Miedema is one of the most feared forwards in the world. Beth Mead is one of the league‚Äôs most in-form players. Kim Little is one of the most talented midfielders on the planet. They were all kept quiet. Arsenal might be making positive strides ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt about that ‚Äì but catching up to the progress Chelsea, and Man City, have made in the last few years will be no easy task. The commitment, investment and time that the Blues have put into this project have been excellent for many years. It got them to a Women‚Äôs Champions League final this year and has made them the team to beat in England. Jonas Eidevall is only a few months into his Arsenal tenure. He‚Äôs a clever coach, and he has some great players, but it will take time yet until the Gunners‚Äô rivalry with Chelsea means as much to the Blues as their competition with City.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rivals-chelsea-justify-hayes-dismissal-of-arsenal-as-women-s/blt62bb13c0c3cd3e5a,Ame√© Ruszkai,4f51808b-b53f-4db6-a8d8-37fec370b493
Reyna makes Borussia Dortmund return after five months out with injury ,"Giovanni Reyna made his return from injury when he came off the bench for Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga clash against Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday. The 19-year-old last featured for the German side in August, when he scored in the 3-2 victory over Hoffenheim. But a muscle injury has kept the attacking midfielder out of action for several months until Marco Rose called on him to make just his fourth Bundesliga appearance of the campaign. The United States international came off the bench to replace Thorgan Hazard at the hour mark of the match. His side were already 4-1 down at Signal Iduna Park, with a Manuel Akanji own goal giving the visitors the lead, followed by goals from Florian Wirtz, Robert Andrich and Jonathan Tah. Dortmund did manage to get one of their own when Jeremie Frimpong put the ball in his own net just five minutes after the opening goal. Reyna had scored twice in the three matches in which he featured for Dortmund at the start of the season. He played an important role for the side last season in what was his first full season as a first-team regular, making 46 appearances in all competitions. Coach Rose was delighted to be able to include him in the team again following his recovery, telling reporters: ""He really wants to be there, had another two good weeks of training. To see him back and to have his quality again is nice and important for us.‚Äù But team-mate Marco Reus, who revealed his team-mates have a funny nickname for the youngster, warned that it will take a while for him to get back to his best. ""I hope he will have a lot more to offer us. He has been out for a really long time,"" he said.  ""It will still take a couple of weeks until he is back to his best but he offers more opportunities in deep, variation in terms of tactics.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/reyna-makes-borussia-dortmund-return-after-five-months-out/blt0ec8e7b40e4e634b,By Peter McVitie,de9569a0-528d-4c28-b280-189ca678befc
"Sule's contract, Tolisso out and how Bayern's January transfer window could look","Bayern Munich are well on their way to a 10th Bundesliga title in a row. But when you are Bayern, domestic success is expected.  A deep squad is needed to compete in the Champions League and European success is what Julian Nagelsmann's first season in charge will be judged on. So, will he be given more firepower this winter, or will the club's bosses hope he can conquer Europe with the players already under his tutelage? And what should fans expect over the next month at the Allianz Arena?  GOAL lays out the potential ins, outs and any other business that could take place in Munich during January... Erling Haaland will be one of the most in-demand players in 2022, so it is no surprise that Bayern Munich are also reported to be interested. A lot, however, will depend on the future of talismanic striker Robert Lewandowski, whose Bayern contract expires in 2023. Talks are set to begin in the spring, with Bayern hoping to keep the Poland international until 2025, but agent Pini Zahavi has previously suggested Lewandowski could move abroad to a team like Paris Saint-Germain or Real Madrid in order to help his chances of winning the Ballon d'Or. Any move for Haaland would depend on a Lewandowski exit, and Bayern would demand a big fee if they were to sell Lewandowski. At least ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$57m) would be required and such a figure could help fund a move for Haaland. The Borussia Dortmund forward has a reported release clause of ‚Ç¨75m (¬£64m/$85m), but agent fees and wages could mean the total package for Haaland would cost at least ‚Ç¨300m (¬£252m/$340m). Another possible exit could pave the way for a new signing down the line, with Niklas Sule free to talk to other teams from now on as his contract is set to expire at the end of the season. Nagelsmann often plays three centre-backs so would need an immediate replacement for Sule, and Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger would be able to come the other direction on a free transfer if he cannot agree a deal at Stamford Bridge. Rudiger's wage demands could prove too high for Bayern as well as Chelsea, however, which means Blues' team-mate Andreas Christensen could be an alternative. Michael Cuisance was linked with a move to Turkey or Russia, but has settled on a move to Serie A side Venezia. Corentin Tolisso is out of contract in the summer and at the moment is unlikely to continue at the club. Therefore, Bayern are willing to cash out early and get some money back in January for the midfielder. Inter and Roma were rumoured to be interested, but no official offer has yet been made. Tolisso's exit could also be hastened by the upturn in form of Marc Roca, who also looked set to leave the club. However, he has impressed in recent weeks after being given a chance to shine because of a lengthy injury list in midfield. Bouna Sarr has not been a success in Munich, with the right-back playing just 11 Bundesliga games since signing from Marseille in 2020. At 29, he is unlikely to develop much more and could be set to go out on loan in the January window before a decision is made on his long-term future. ""I never thought about leaving. I will evaluate the situation with the club in the summer,"" Sarr told L'Equipe.  ""For me, my injury last season affected me. Bayern is a big club, you always have to be at the top. Bayern didn't sign me for nothing. ""The upcoming Africa Cup of Nations will be a chance for me to get game time. I will use it to show what I'm capable of."" Adrian Fein is expected to have his loan deal with Greuther Furth terminated so he can move to a different club to get match experience. The 22-year-old midfielder impressed at PSV last season but has not been able to break into the Furth midfield this campaign as they battle to avoid Bundesliga relegation. Sule's future is the most pressing contract situation for Bayern at the moment. The centre-back's current deal will expire in the summer, putting many teams on high alert, including Chelsea and Newcastle. In November, sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic confirmed that talks had begun between Bayern and Sule, but a resolution was not expected quickly.  ‚ÄúHe has an expiring contract. The talks are not easy,"" Salihamidzic told DAZN. ""If there‚Äôs anything to be said about it, we‚Äôll say that."" Sule has been an impressive performer for Bayern in the past few seasons, also filling in at right-back when needed. The Bavarians are eager to keep hold of him, but wage demands could prove a stumbling block. Bayern have shown in the past that they will not simply give in to players and agents, with David Alaba allowed leave to join Real Madrid on a free transfer last summer. ""It is legitimate that the players want their value,"" Bayern president Herbert Hainer told Sport1-Doppelpass. ""But it is also legitimate for us as a club to say that we are no longer willing to pay this money. We did that with David Alaba."" Long-term contracts are also something to keep an eye out for at the Allianz Arena. Bayern have secured the future of their midfield by tying Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich down. Serge Gnabry has been in talks over a new contract and is expected to sign an extension to stay in Munich. His existing contract expires at the end of June 2023, but Nagelsmann sees him as an integral part of his attack. Meanwhile, Lewandowski's future needs to be tied up in the coming months or else Bayern will begin to look for a potential suitor, with Haaland likely to be near the top of their list.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sule-contract-tolisso-out-how-bayern-january-transfer-window/blt1c2514d86a784172,Ronan Murphy,1c56a486-68f4-4898-8de1-709f5e04b4a7
Werner rescues Chelsea at Luton but frustrated forward could follow Abramovich out of Stamford Bridge,"For a long time during Tuesday night's FA Cup clash with Luton, Timo Werner looked as stunned as many of his Chelsea team-mates by the news that Roman Abramovich is going to sell the club. The announcement came just an hour before kick-off at Kenilworth Road and it seemed as if one shock exit was going to be quickly followed by another, as first-half goals from Reece Burke and Harry Cornick gave the hosts a 2-1 half-time lead over the reigning European and world champions. However, Werner turned the fifth-round tie on its head after the break, latching onto Ruben Loftus-Cheek's long ball to net his first goal in eight games before teeing up Romelu Lukaku for a late winner. ""Timo played very well,"" Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel told reporters after the game. ""I am happy about that and the fact that Romelu got his goal. That is why we left them on the pitch. ""These matches are, at the moment, the most important matches for them, even if they think they should have played this match or that match."" It was certainly an important outing for Werner. The 25-year-old has been afforded fewer minutes than any of Chelsea's other senior attacking players this season, so this was a rare chance to shine. For much of the match, he really struggled to make an impact, but his goal changed everything. ""I am happy that I made my goal and an assist,"" he told BBC Sport afterwards.¬†""I¬†tried to help the team as much as I could to win the game and this is what we did today."" Timo Werner came through with a goal and two assists ü•∂ pic.twitter.com/xbTJT35cnQ Whether his second-half showing could also prove a turning point in his Chelsea career remains to be seen. The ¬£47.5 million signing from RB Leipzig has become increasingly frustrated with his lack of game time and has been considering his options ahead of the summer transfer window. Werner's representatives are due to meet with Chelsea officials in the coming weeks to better understand Tuchel's plans for their client before deciding on their next move. If those talks don't end well, the forward might seriously consider a move to Borussia Dortmund, who are keen on bringing Werner back to Germany, which would certainly appeal to a player that GOAL understands has struggled to settle in London. Of course, Werner's weekly wage of ¬£250,000 ($335,000) could prove problematic, given it's highly unlikely that Dortmund would be willing to match such a salary. Any deal could hinge on Dortmund's ongoing pursuit of Karim Adeyemi. If their talks with RB Salzburg collapse, a move for Werner becomes far more likely but the transfer might require Chelsea to pay a portion of his wages if the attacker refuses to take a significant pay cut.¬† So, even though Werner proved decisive at Luton, there remains a major question mark over his future at Stamford Bridge. After all, in 76 appearances for Chelsea, he has still only contributed 19 goals and 18 assists.¬† Those figures justify Tuchel's refusal to pick him on a regular basis. Werner was one of Abramovich's last big-money signings and there is still a chance that he could soon follow the Russian out of the exit door.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/werner-rescues-chelsea-luton-striker-follow-abramovich/blt89b71d8f8f4cefe4,Nizaar Kinsella,a62b14e7-9191-4a4c-a60d-38482ce2c6f8
Tuchel is Chelsea's greatest asset - new Blues owners must give him everything he needs to succeed,"Chelsea faced 13-time Champions League winners, and, according to their Ultras‚Äô banner, the self-proclaimed kings of Europe, in Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night and gave them the scare of their lives.¬† This quarter-final second leg had been dubbed 'Mission Impossible' with the Blues 3-1 down from the first leg at Stamford Bridge following a Karim Benzema hat-trick, but Chelsea were only 15 short minutes away from completing that mission.¬† At 3-0 up, after goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner, Chelsea were on the verge of arguably their greatest-ever European comeback.¬† But individual quality in the form of Luka Modric's stunning assist for Rodrygo and Karim Benzema's 38th goal of the season ended Chelsea‚Äôs efforts to retain their European crown.¬† ""We got beaten by the pure individual quality and offensive conversion after our mistakes,"" Thomas Tuchel told reporters after the match.¬† ""Unfortunately, we had two mistakes after ball wins and they were the most crucial moments in games against Real Madrid. ""In the end, we were unlucky. We deserved to go through after this performance and match today, but it was not meant to be."" Of course, mistakes were made over the two legs. Edouard Mendy gave a cheap goal away at Stamford Bridge and poor play in possession was punished in the second leg with devastating goals.¬† Whatever happens. @ChelseaFC are blessed with Thomas Tuchel. What a manager. Without his own Benzema, Tuchel saw his side become wasteful towards the end of the game, with Christian Pulisic missing two late clear chances, while urther misses followed in extra-time from Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Jorginho. However, the impression left after the two matches is that Chelsea had the superior game plan and will certainly be back to fight for more trophies‚Ä¶ if the circumstances are right.¬† Chelsea's supporters carried a lifesize cardboard cutout of their Champions League-winning coach Tuchel into the stadium, and there is a real possibility that he can overcome the hiring and firing culture at this club.¬† There is total belief in his work; almost the entire squad is onside with the German's methods and dedication.¬† They have the talents of the academy to blood and loanees such as Conor Gallagher likely to return to the club over the summer. Amid uncertainty over the club's ownership, with Roman Abramovich having been sanctioned last month, Tuchel has handled the situation with grace and class.¬† He is the best thing about the west Londoners right now. Tuchel was asked what he wants from any potential new owners and delivered a clear and concise six-word message: ""A strong squad, confidence and support.""¬† It owes to the maturity Tuchel has gained as a coach after being criticised for falling out with his bosses in his previous roles at Mainz, Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain. With four bidders entering their final offers for Chelsea on April 14, each has been laying on the charm for supporters in an attempt to win the popularity contest.¬† Stephen Pagliuca became the final possible owner to release a statement ahead of kick-off.¬† ""We would first like to wish Thomas and the Chelsea squad the very best of luck ahead of tonight‚Äôs Champions League match against Real Madrid,"" the statement read.¬† ""Having witnessed a great 6-0 win against Southampton last week, I hope to see a comeback for the ages against Real Madrid in the quarter-final second leg."" Candidate Tom Ricketts also praised Tuchel's work with the others promising continued investment. It did not quite happen for Chelsea against Carlo Ancelotti's side on the night, but it should convince any new owners to continue this perfect marriage between coach and club.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-chelsea-greatest-asset-new-blues-owners-everything/blt4d1d585cdcc5de33,Nizaar Kinsella,03e52927-cca1-43bb-b108-63fc70f68851
De Gea labels Man Utd's performance in Everton loss 'a disgrace' & admits they 'don't even create proper chances',"David De Gea labelled Manchester United's performance against Everton ""a disgrace"" while admitting that they ""don't even create proper chances"" and have a huge task on their hands to finish in the top four. United missed the chance to move level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham after losing 1-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday, with Anthony Gordon grabbing the winning goal for the Toffees. Ralf Rangnick's side only managed four shots on target over the course of the 90 minutes, much to the frustration of De Gea, who felt they once again failed to live up to the required standard at one of the biggest clubs in European football. The Spanish shot-stopper got the impression that Everton wanted the three points more than United and was disappointed by the lack of fight they showed in such an important fixture. ""We knew before today they were struggling and how difficult it was going to be,"" he told BT Sport post-match. ""We don‚Äôt score, we don‚Äôt even create proper chances to score. I don‚Äôt know what to say, to be honest. We‚Äôre not good enough, that‚Äôs for sure. It‚Äôs going to be very difficult now to be in the top four. ""Of course it‚Äôs not the perfect atmosphere. They were tired, they were nervous, but they keep going and keep fighting. They had more desire than us, which is not acceptable. It‚Äôs very sad to lose today. ""It's a disgrace from us, we should be winning this game."" United are already destined to finish the season without a trophy, and are now also in real danger of missing out on Champions League qualification. If Tottenham win their game in hand against Aston Villa they will be six points clear of the Manchester outfit with only seven games remaining, while Arsenal are also currently in a better position. Rangnick will hope that his underperforming team can get back on track and revive their top-four hopes when Norwich arrive at Old Trafford on April 16, three days before the Red Devils are due to take in a trip to Anfield to face quadruple-chasing Liverpool.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/de-gea-labels-man-utd-s-performance-in-everton-loss-a/bltaf04dec2052e3d14,James Westwood,ac15dc48-aa14-41cd-bde7-7f9dc8cf907b
'They extended my deal for a reason' - Nketiah aims to prove Arsenal doubters wrong as he talks Ghana and No 14,"Eddie Nketiah has told his doubters that Arsenal handed him a new contract ‚Äúfor a reason‚Äù, with the 23-year-old striker confident he can deliver on expectations that come with representing the Gunners and inheriting the iconic No 14 jersey that was once worn by club legend Thierry Henry. Having been due to hit free agency this summer as his previous deal at Emirates Stadium expired, Nketiah has decided to stay put and commit to fresh terms to 2027. Questions have been asked of whether he is ready to play a prominent role for the Premier League heavyweights despite 56 appearances across the last two seasons, and the former England U21 international is determined to silence his critics where it matters most ‚Äì on the field. After scoring 10 goals last season and finishing the campaign as Mikel Arteta‚Äôs go-to option when it comes to leading the line, Nketiah told The Telegraph of earning a new contract: ‚ÄúWhen you get a run of eight games in the first team, you get that database and platform to show everything you can do. ‚ÄúI have worked a lot with the manager on playing with my back to goal, on the spaces to drop into and link play. Of course it has been developed, but at the same time you don‚Äôt get here by just standing in the penalty box and scoring a goal. ‚ÄúPeople are always going to say things, but I know what I can do. The people that have played with me, played against me, the coaches that have worked with me, I know how they feel about me. ‚ÄúEvery team needs a squad to compete. The club is always looking for ways to strengthen. They have extended my deal and they have done so for a reason. Whoever comes in, you relish the challenge. You make them feel welcome, and then you fight and compete.‚Äù Alongside penning a new deal, Nketiah has also agreed to change his squad number from 30 to 14, which will see him follow in the illustrious footsteps of Arsenal‚Äôs all-time leading scorer, Henry. On that decision, a confident character added: ""I joined the club at the age of 14, I wore 14 on loan at Leeds, and I even lived at No 14 at one point. ""When the opportunity came up to take it, it was hard to say no. I know what it means to the club and the fans. It‚Äôs a nice feeling, an iconic number. ""We know it is a special shirt and Thierry has made it cool to wear this shirt, just like he did with long socks and gloves. It is what we have grown up with. I am just trying to be the best version of myself. I‚Äôm focused on creating my own memories in that shirt, leaving my own stamp on it."" Nobody in history has scored more goals for England‚Äôs U21 side than Nketiah's 16 efforts, but there is still a chance he could switch allegiance to Ghana if opportunities with the Three Lions prove hard to come by. Nketiah said of joining the Black Stars: ‚ÄúThere have been discussions, but nothing has been decided.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/extended-deal-nketiah-arsenal-doubters-ghana-no-14/bltaa5cccfafea7096a,Chris Burton,e7eb61b1-a2f2-4a51-9ecf-cd5adec994f5
Plymouth Argyle issue plea after intruders drive tractor over League One club's pitch,"Plymouth Argyle have issued a criminal damage report following a break-in from intruders that drove a tractor over the League One club's pitch. The club reported the incident to police on June 5 and are offering a reward for information from the public following the ""mindless destruction"" of the Home Park pitch, which had been in an ""early and crucial stage of renovation"". Plymouth have also said that it will now be necessary to ""re-germinate the playing surface"" in a major setback to their preparations for pre-season. The League One outfit have also said that the intruders had inside knowledge of the stadium as they broke through perimeter fencing before using tools to start up a tractor specifically used for groundwork. ‚ÄúThis work comes at additional cost to the club and places our grounds team under further pressure, with an already tight turnaround for scheduled pre-season matches,"" an official statement reads. ""The club will also be upscaling security at the stadium to ensure that this does not happen again. Of course, this adds further expense, deviating vital funds away from enhancing the stadium, squad and match-day experience at Argyle. ‚ÄúIt should go without saying, but any true supporter of Argyle would not engage in such mindless destruction.  ""The trespassers‚Äô ability to efficiently break down newly-installed fencing with specific tools, before accessing the grounds team‚Äôs garage and recently-installed roof lighting control system, suggests that the intruders had a solid operational knowledge of Home Park, and the club will be lending its full support to the police in an attempt to see these individuals identified and punished accordingly.‚Äù ‚ö†Ô∏è Break In and Pitch Damage @homeparkstadium The club has today reported criminal damage at Home Park following a break-in at the stadium on the night of Saturday, 4 June.Please read full details below, and help if you have any information üëáhttps://t.co/hxKMZBASvg #pafc Argyle have less than a month remaining before their annual pre-season friendly against Plymouth Parkway Football Club is due to take place at Home Park.

Why Shearer rates Drogba ahead of Salah as best ever African in Premier League,"Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer believes ex-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, is the greatest African to have played in the Premier League. The Ivorian spent nine years at the club in two different stints, guiding them to several major trophies. His initial stint was between 2004 and 2012, while his second was in the 2014/15 season. Yaya Toure, Nwankwo Kanu, Emmanuel Adebayor, Jay-Jay Okocha and recently Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are some of the players who have excelled in the Premier League. For instance, Salah has been a hit at Liverpool since joining in 2017. Apart from scoring more than 150 goals for them, he has won the Premier League title, the Champions League and the Fifa Club World Cup. However, Shearer still rates Drogba higher than the Egypt captain, ""For me, it‚Äôs Drogba just for the fact that he has four Premier League titles, four FA cups, nine goals in nine cup finals, one Champions League title and 177 goals for Chelsea, that is for me,"" Shearer said as quoted by the London World. Shearer's sentiments are the same as those expressed by Nigerian football icon Yakubu Ayegbeni in a previous interview when he was comparing Salah and Drogba. The former Everton and Middlesbrough goal machine did not see the rationale for considering the 29-year-old as the best African to have graced the English top-flight ‚Äì although the ‚ÄòYak‚Äô marveled at the ex-AS Roma star‚Äôs exploits in Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs squad so far. ""You cannot say Salah is the greatest African to play in the Premier League. Drogba was something special because he was scoring for fun,"" Ayegbeni told GOAL.  ""However, you have to give Salah the credit for breaking the big legend‚Äôs record, which makes him one of the greatest Africans in the English top-flight, but for now, he is certainly not the greatest.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-shearer-rates-drogba-ahead-of-salah-as-best-ever-african/blt8dfb17484d10537a,Seth Willis,b669debb-8db6-4b8b-bc3a-48b2c9059e75
Berhalter's biggest dilemma: How to turn USMNT 'dominance' into goals,"There are just four games remaining in the U.S. men's national team's World Cup qualifying campaign and, thus far, it is hard to truly analyse how they have done. On one hand, the U.S. have largely taken care of business, sitting second in the table with their fate very much in their own hands. Sure, the U.S. have had some slip-ups and poor performances along the way, but who hasn't (besides Canada)? On the other, and even looking past those slip-ups, the USMNT has not played anything close to swashbuckling soccer. They have been flat in the first half of almost every game, and have legitimate issues when it comes to scoring goals. In total, they have netted just 13 goals in 10 games, with four of those coming in a win over their next opponents, Honduras. Aside from a spectacular win over Mexico and that second-half explosion against Honduras, the U.S. has never truly looked like a great team. They have looked good at times, but not great. Have they underwhelmed? No. But have they overwhelmed? Not really that either. The U.S., for lack of a better term, has whelmed. And that is what made Gregg Berhalter's postgame comments after Sunday's loss to Canada so controversial. After falling 2-0 to Canada in a game that the U.S. was chasing for over 80 minutes, Berhalter strongly defended his team's performance. ""I think it was an entire team effort that was outstanding,"" Berhalter said. ""We asked them to be dominant, we asked them to embrace the conditions, embrace the physicality and I think we did that and more. ""It's hard for me to remember a performance away from home this dominant without getting a result."" He continued: ""They couldn't handle our physicality. That's plain and simple. We were running them all over the pitch, and when you look at duels won, when you look at our pressing, they had a very, very hard time dealing with what we were giving them."" Those comments do not sound like they reflect a game that ended in a 2-0 defeat. They also do not sound like they reflect a game where Canada's expected goals (xG) total was higher, and where roughly an even numbers of duels were won by both teams. But, when asked if he had changed his mind in the days following that defeat, Berhalter doubled down, saying that he is still pleased with how his team played. ""Watching the game back confirmed what I was talking about,"" Berhalter said. ""We were bitterly disappointed with the loss, but happy with the effort and think there was more in that game. We could have gotten more out of the game. FINAL:üá®üá¶ CAN 2 - 0 USA üá∫üá∏We're gonna need everything you've got back home in St. Paul. pic.twitter.com/qqVBgfXYxn ""Watching it back, I think the one thing I was noticing was Canada was in a very low block... and it became challenging. That was an area that we could have improved on. ""There were moments in and around the penalty box where we could have been more clinical with our passing, with our crossing and then the offensive transition should have been better in the moments that they were open. ""We could have taken advantage of that in a better way, but, again, pleased with the effort of the group and pleased with the intensity."" In a way, part of it is understandable. The U.S. continues to look like a Berhalter-coached team. They play proactive, possession-based soccer. They play out from the back. They play through dynamic wingers that are the team's main source of chance creation. When Berhalter was hired, he was tasked with not just winning, but changing the perception of American soccer. The hope was that he could make this team less reactionary, less reliant on heart and grit and more technical and tactical than past iterations. So, in that aspect, Sunday was a job well done. The team played in the system, did what they were asked to do and certainly tried to break Canada down. Stylistically, they played the way they wanted to play. But the problem is that soccer games are not won by the team that is stylistically best or that possesses the ball more; they are won by the team that scores the most goals. And, as things stand, the USMNT simply does not score enough goals. There are several reasons for that. One is just a general lack of sharpness, as the U.S. has a habit of wasting chances. One is a general lack of speed, as the U.S. continues to be too slow and too methodical when breaking teams down. And one is that several players, namely Christian Pulisic, are out of form right now, and not creating to the best of their abilities. Add those together and you will have a tough time scoring goals. But then you can also add in the USMNT's biggest issue right now: the No.9 play. For months, Ricardo Pepi has been the go-to guy at the No.9 position, and rightfully so, as the teenager remains the team's leading scorer in qualifying. But in the last two games, Berhalter has turned to Jesus Ferreira and Gyasi Zardes and, despite good moments from both, neither has been able to find the net. So is it as simple as putting Pepi back in and letting him finish the chances? Maybe, but Pepi did not exactly sparkle during his most recent national team games either. And even if it is that simple, is it fair to say that the USMNT's entire goalscoring problem is dependent on one 19-year-old forward that did not even make his debut until the fall? The fix, then, is complicated, with multiple components to it. The first part is simple sharpness, something the U.S. doesn't have right now. MLS players are just starting preseason, while several key players are not in the best form or playing regularly for their clubs. Breaking down a bunkered team is all about being sharp, quick and decisive - all things the U.S. has not been in recent games. The second part, then, is about system. Berhalter's tactics obviously work, and have worked in several big games this cycle, but it also seems to weigh on the U.S. when they do win the ball back. In those moments, it appears the players are thinking too much, or too little, and simply keeping possession in a bid to set up the system rather than make any attacking inroads. One of Jurgen Klinsmann's biggest demands during his tenure was for players to express themselves and, right now, those expressions have not felt quite right. Wednesday night is a good chance to fix that, as the U.S. face a Honduras team that is already eliminated from World Cup contention. For most of this qualifying run, Honduras have been downright bad, to the point that even a poor attacking performance should be enough to earn three points. In some ways, that is all that matters. It is not how you get to Qatar, but rather that you actaully get there. The harsh realities of the last cycle show that. But Wednesday's game is also another chance for the U.S. to actually go out and dominate in the way Berhalter wants them to, while also easing all of the doubts surrounding a team that has not been at its best far too often in recent months.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/berhalter-biggest-dilemma-usmnt-dominance-goals/bltc45e2737c29a4856,Ryan Tolmich,7b2923b1-e31e-40ed-be07-cd9ee6f62f41
Netherlands stars Miedema and Groenen test positive for Covid-19 in big blow to Euros holders,"Netherlands stars Vivianne Miedema and Jackie Groenen have tested positive for Covid-19, it was confirmed on Tuesday. The news comes as a big blow to the Oranje Leeuwinnen's hopes at the 2022 Women's European Championship, as the pair will likely miss Wednesday's clash against Portugal. The 25-year-old striker is the national team's top scorer of all-time and was the Player of the Match when they drew 1-1 with Sweden in their opening game of the campaign. Groenen, who has also long been a key player for the Dutch side, impressed against Sweden too and was confirmed to have contracted the virus. An update from Netherlands read: ""Vivianne Miedema has unfortunately tested positive for Covid-19 and will therefore be in isolation for the next few days.  ""When she no longer has any symptoms and tests negative, she can re-join the selection."" The same was said of 27-year-old Groenen. The news of the concerns surrounding Miedema and Groenen was confirmed just a day after the Dutch suffered a significant injury blow. Goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal¬†was forced to leave the Netherlands squad after sustaining a shoulder injury during the match against Sweden. Feyenoord's Jacintha Weimar¬†was called up to take her place, having been named on the team's standby list by coach Mark Parsons. Aniek Nouwen¬†suffered an ankle injury in their first game of the competition and will likely miss the meeting with Portugal, but will stay with the squad. Miedema and Groenen are just the latest figures to have contracted Covid-19 at the tournament in England. At least nine players have tested positive so far. England's Lotte Wubben Moy, Lea Schuller at Germany, Finland's Tuija Hyyrynen, Laura Wienroither of Austria and Italy player Valentina Cernoia have all come down with Covid-19 at the Euros. Lisa Kolb tested positive before the tournament, meanwhile, and the figure could rise to 10 amid reports her Austria co-star Katharina Naschenweng has also come down with it.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/netherlands-miedema-groenen-covid-19-euros/blt00fc9fcfcccafe41,Peter McVitie,f30f3e56-26d6-4ed3-97b2-a14d498e6bf5
‚ÄòI don't believe Messi's chapter at Barcelona is over‚Äô ‚Äì Laporta longing to bring Argentine back to Camp Nou,"Lionel Messi returning to Barcelona remains a distinct possibility in the eyes of Joan Laporta, with the Blaugrana president claiming that the Argentine‚Äôs historic ‚Äúchapter‚Äù at Camp Nou is not yet finished. For now, a seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner finds himself on the books of Paris Saint-Germain, having made a move to France as a free agent in the summer of 2021. Financial difficulties for La Liga giants meant that a contract could not be offered to an all-time great back then, but Barca have worked hard to generate much-needed funds and a retracing of steps to Catalunya for a legendary figure may yet be arranged. The mercurial 35-year-old still has a year left to run on his contract at PSG, while a 12-month extension to 2024 is being speculated on, but Laporta has told ESPN when asked if a South American superstar could return to Barcelona: ‚ÄúMessi has been everything. ‚ÄúFor Barca, he has possibly been the best player in history, the most efficient, only comparable to Johan Cruyff in the history of Barca. ‚ÄúBut it had to happen one day, we had to make a decision as a consequence of the legacy we had received, the institution is above players and coaches. ‚ÄúI don't believe Messi's chapter at Barcelona is over. And I believe it is our responsibility to make sure that chapter is still open, that it hasn't closed. ‚ÄúTo have a moment to do it how it should have been done so that he may have a much more splendid ending than what he had.‚Äù Pick Lionel Messi's best attacking trio ü§î pic.twitter.com/HWnRZQjQlk Any deal for Messi will not be easy, as he is now tied to the reigning Ligue 1 champions and is not getting any younger, but Laporta believes that Barca ‚Äúowe‚Äù it to former fan favourite to put things right. He added: ‚ÄúDo I feel like I owe him one? Yes. ‚ÄúMorally, as the president of Barcelona, I think I did what needed to be done. But also as Barcelona's president, and personally, I believe I owe him one.‚Äù Messi previously hit 672 goals for Barca through 778 appearances, helping them to 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns while collecting a record-setting haul of Golden Balls on a personal level.

2022 World Cup Qualifier: Tunisia defender Montassar wary of Mali threat,"Tunisia defender Talbi Montassar insists his teammates have to remain focused to stand a chance of 'finishing' the job when they play Mali on Tuesday night in the second leg of the 2022 World Cup qualifier. The North Africans needed a Moussa Sissako own goal on Friday, March 25 to get a slim advantage, and will hope to get another positive outcome in Rades to make it to Qatar. However, the Rubin Kazan defender concedes the Eagles are not an easy team and they will be aiming at causing an upset. ""We are very proud but we are also staying focused because we are aware that we haven't finished the job yet,"" Montassar told BBC Sport Africa. ""It was a difficult game on Friday against a very good Mali team. We had a positive result but we also know that Mali is a dangerous team when they play away from home so we have to stay focused.  ""We'll try to do a great game at home on Tuesday to bring back the qualification."" This will be the third time the two nations are meeting in less than two months. The initial meeting was in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) held in Cameroon between January and February. The two nations were in Group F and Ibrahima Kone scored the lone goal of the match to ensure Mali collected maximum points. In that particular match, which was marred by officiating controversy, Wahbi Khazri failed to convert the Carthage Eagles penalty. While Mali have never made it to the World Cup, Tunisia have qualified five times. The first time they qualified was in 1978 before waiting for 20 years to make it to the global competition again. The three other appearances were in 2002, 2006, and 2018 respectively. If they manage to get an aggregate win over Mali, the North Africans will be among the five nations that will be fighting for the trophy in Qatar.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifier-tunisia-defender-montassar-wary-of-mali-/blt5151a419d2fc1b0d,Seth Willis,7f755a22-e4b6-4ecd-bd81-5e4c014b9751

Tottenham players would 'run through a brick wall' for Conte - Davies,"Tottenham defender Ben Davies has lauded manager Antonio Conte and says his team-mates are ""willing to run through a brick wall"" for the Italian coach. Conte has overseen a strong start to the new Premier League season in north London, and his passion has endeared him to players and the club's fans.  Spurs opened up with a 4-1 win over Southampton and followed with a 2-2 draw away at Chelsea in which Harry Kane netted a dramatic late equaliser. Conte was in the spotlight at Stamford Bridge after a heated clash with counterpart Thomas Tuchel that resulted in both men being sent off. Davies was not surprised by Conte's touchline row and feels the Italian's passion for the game has already influenced the whole squad at Tottenham.

Coutinho's Brazil return unlikely due to salary differences,"Philippe Coutinho's prospective return to his native Brazil has reached an impasse over the Barcelona star's elevated salary demands.  The playmaker is unsettled at Camp Nou and keen to seek a new club.  But his generous wage package in Catalunya all but rules out a move to even one of Serie A's giants. GOAL understands that Coutinho is looking to leave Barcelona after three and a half underwhelming seasons.  The Catalans too are happy to sanction a transfer, despite the Brazilian playing a bigger part in the club's plans during 2021-22 than in previous years.  But while several Brazilian clubs have been linked with a blockbuster homecoming for the star, the chances of a deal being struck are slim.  Coutinho earns ‚Ç¨15 million a year at Barcelona, and wishes to maintain his salary at any potential new club.  Such a figure would make him the best-paid player in Brazil by a considerable distance, and not even the likes of Flamengo, Corinthians and Palmeiras, the nation's wealthiest teams, would be able to add that wage burden to their budgets.  The Premier League is the ex-Liverpool star's favoured destination, and his management team have already made contact with clubs in England over a prospective move.  Coutinho arrived at Camp Nou as one of the world's most valuable creative midfielders following five impressive years at Anfield.  But the Brazilian, now 29, has struggled to hit his stride in Spain, and was released on loan to Bayern Munich in 2019-20 after becoming surplus to requirements.  A knee injury kept him out of action for most of Barca's following season, but he has played a bigger part in the club's plans this term, featuring in 16 of the club's 18 Liga matches to date and scoring on two occasions.

Sagna urges Arsenal to give Lacazette new contract and would love Gnabry back,"Arsenal must do everything they can to keep Alexandre Lacazette at the club next season, according to former Gunners defender Bacary Sagna. Lacazette has been a key part of Arsenal's push for the top four this season, captaining the side since the start of December as Mikel Arteta's men aim for a Champions League return. Hoiwever his contract expires in the summer, and Sagna says keeping the 30-year-old at Emirates Stadium must be a priority. Speaking to Genting Casino, Sagna said: ""If I was Arsenal, I would do everything they can to try and keep Lacazette. ""When you see the way he‚Äôs playing, he‚Äôs a good leader, a natural leader, he‚Äôs been at the club for such a long time, so he knows the club perfectly.  ""I think he is doing well, he brings so much to the squad at the moment. So, you want to be able to keep someone like him, Arsenal shouldn‚Äôt let him go because he has this vision that the club needs."" While Lacazette may leave Arsenal in the summer, one former Gunner who could return is Serge Gnabry, with the club linked with a move for the Bayern Munich forward. Sagna was a team mate of Gnabry at Arsenal between 2011 and 2016, and feels the Germany international would be a perfect signing. He said: ""I would love to see Gnabry back at Arsenal. I saw him starting at Arsenal so I know what he‚Äôs capable of. He‚Äôs been developing amazingly in Germany in two different clubs and I think it could be the time for him to come back. ""He‚Äôs a brilliant player, powerful, fast, efficient. He already knows the club, he knows the team, so for him it‚Äôs home."" The current crop of Arsenal players meanwhile will continue their push for the top four tonight when they face Liverpool in the Premier League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sagna-arsenal-lacazette-new-contract-gnabry/blted1bfddf003ecddd,Emma Smith,7a586a5c-af0e-43be-b476-c6f8e9727527
"Pogba's contract, Martial's exit and how Man Utd's January transfer window could look","With the transfer window just about to reopen, Manchester United are being linked with a whole host of superstars, while a large number of players are also being tipped to depart. However, interim manager Ralf Rangnick has already made clear his feelings on doing business in January.¬† When recently pressed on the prospect of new arrivals, the German told reporters: ""It needs to be a player who improves the team. It needs to be a high-quality player, no matter in which area of the pitch."" Rangnick evidently believes that finding such a talent is always difficult at this time of year and that is a view shared by his employers.  United may presently find themselves outside of the Premier League's top four but they do not want to make any panic buys.  So, what will the Red Devils' January window look like? GOAL runs through all of the possible moves below...¬† Let‚Äôs start this section with a dose of reality. While the names that are going to be mentioned are players that are undeniably admired at Old Trafford, sources say that United expect to have a ""very quiet"" window in terms of signings.¬† That‚Äôs not to say a big name couldn't arrive. After all, United acquired Bruno Fernandes in January 2020 and the Portuguese had a transformative effect on the team, so the board are more than aware of the impact a mid-season signing can have.  However, they would only make a move in the upcoming window if a long-term target is suddenly put up for sale. Indeed, Rangnick has been told he will be backed in the transfer market if the right player becomes available at the right price. A midfielder is top of the shopping list for the summer, with RB Leipzig's Amadou Haidara, Kalvin Phillips, Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham all of interest. However, the chances of any of those players arriving in January remain very slim.¬† In terms of attacking options, Erling Haaland is still the primary target but Borussia Dortmund have no intention of letting the Norway international leave Signal Iduna Park next month. United will instead battle it out with a host of top European clubs to try to sign the striker at the end of the season.¬† With such an inflated squad and a number of players unhappy with a lack of playing time, it‚Äôs hardly surprising that outgoings are more likely than incomings next month.  Anthony Martial is the most likely departure, with the forward having made clear his desire to leave the club in January. However, United will not let him go on the cheap.¬† GOAL understands that Sevilla have made an approach to take the France forward until the end of the season but United want a loan fee and for all of his wages to be covered by the Spanish side.  If their demands are not met, United will be more than happy to keep the 26-year-old ‚Äì who is under contract until 2024 ‚Äì for the remainder of the 2021-22 campaign. Phil Jones is another player desperate for regular first-team football. The centre-back is finally available again after a long injury lay-off but has not played a competitive game since January 2020.  The 29-year-old has requested to play for the Under-23s in order to get match fit and a number of clubs are said to be interested in signing the defender in January. While United would be open to offers, it is understood that they have yet to receive a formal approach for Jones.¬†¬† Amad could leave on a temporary basis. The 19-year-old saw a summer loan move to Feyenoord break down after he sustained an injury which ruled him out for months.  He has now fully recovered and with so much attacking talent in Rangnick's squad, Amad is open to a loan move, and several clubs are interested. United also need to make a decision on goalkeeper Dean Henderson.  The England international has fallen behind David de Gea in the pecking order and is unlikely to oust the Spaniard from the No.1 spot anytime soon. It is understood the possibility of a loan move is being discussed, with the goalkeeper keen to get back playing again.¬† Donny van de Beek is also desperate to kickstart his career. GOAL understands that the Dutchman switched agents a couple of months ago in a bid to get a permanent move out of Old Trafford but he is still waiting for a potential buyer to emerge.  The midfielder wanted to see if his first-team opportunities increased after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal but Rangnick has only started Van de Beek in the Champions League dead rubber against Young Boys, while he's only seen six minutes of Premier League action under the new boss.¬† Four first-team players are out of contract next summer. Juan Mata appears unlikely to move on in January, so he's expected to bid farewell to Old Trafford next summer, with no talk of the former Spain international being offered a renewal. Jesse Lingard continues to spend most of his time on the bench and talks over a new deal have broken down, meaning he is free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with overseas clubs from January 1. However, it is understood that despite interest from elsewhere, he is more likely to stay put for now and then move on at the end of the season.¬† Edinson Cavani is also being continually linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Spanish media have been talking up a move to Barcelona but sources insist that there has been no official approach and the constant reports are being dismissed by United as ""noise"" from agents and other clubs.¬† Then, there‚Äôs Paul Pogba. One of the biggest names in world football is into the final six months of his contract. He has been offered a new deal but there has been no indication that he is going to sign it. However, while United are facing the very real prospect of losing Pogba for nothing in the summer, he is, according to sources, still expected to see out the season at Old Trafford.¬† United would be willing to listen to offers for the France international in January but GOAL understands that they have yet to receive any bids.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pogba-martial-man-utd-january-transfer-window/bltda09d6cda14e2730,Charlotte Duncker,bfa917c9-86ee-4e2a-94de-9dddfdeb12e8
Man City's Walker: Premier League is more difficult than the Champions League,"Manchester City right-back Kyle Walker believes it is more difficult to win the Premier League than the Champions League. The 31-year-old has won three Premier League titles since joining City in 2017, but has never claimed the European crown - although did claim a runners-up medal in 2021. But the England international is determined to win the continent‚Äôs premier club competition before he retires from the game. He told talkSPORT: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what this club needs (the Champions League). We say it every season in the four years since I‚Äôve been here. This club needs to compete with Manchester United, Liverpool. We need to go and get a Champions League. ‚ÄúWe were close last year. A better team won on the day. My honest feeling is the Premier League is different, it‚Äôs more difficult with the 38 games you play throughout the season. ‚ÄúThe Champions League is 13 games to the final. For me, I want the Premier League. The Champions League is something you dream about and hopefully I can make my dreams come true this year.‚Äù Asked how much longer he expects to keep playing, Walker said: ‚ÄúI hope many more years. I‚Äôve still got until 2024 on my contract, which takes me to 34. I still feel sharp, I still feel quick. ‚ÄúI want the Champions League, I don‚Äôt want to finish my career without the Champions League. ‚ÄúThe club deserves it with what we‚Äôve achieved over the last years. Hopefully more Premier League titles and more silverware. ‚ÄúPersonally, I just want to keep playing football for as long as I can. I‚Äôve said it before, until my legs tell me I have to stop, then I‚Äôll stop.‚Äù Pep Guardiola‚Äôs team booked their place in the second round of the Champions League by finishing top of their group, ahead of Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig and Club Brugge. They will face Portuguese side Sporting CP in the last-16, with the first leg of the tie being played in Lisbon on February 15.

Telles confident Man Utd can ‚Äòrescue‚Äô season for new boss as Rangnick‚Äôs squad ignore Ten Hag talk,"Alex Telles remains confident that Manchester United‚Äôs class of 2021-22 can ‚Äúrescue‚Äù an inconsistent campaign and put the foundations in place for a new manager to build on, with playing staff at Old Trafford ignoring the speculation which suggests that Erik ten Hag is close to taking the reins. The Red Devils continue to work under the interim charge of Ralf Rangnick for now, with the experienced German drafted in to bridge a gap between two permanent appointments following the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United cannot afford to allow events off the field to become a distraction in the present, as they chase down a top-four finish, with Champions League qualification vital if future progress is to be made once a new coaching team is put in place. United have seven games left to take in this season and currently sit seventh in the Premier League table, six points adrift of Tottenham and with only one victory secured in their last seven matches across all competitions. Speaking to Sky Sports, Brazilian defender Telles has said of the rumours regarding potential managerial moves: ""No, I don't think it influences us because we know what we have to do. ""There are people at the club working on the new manager - but that's for next season. And next season depends on what we do in these remaining games, so we need to stay focused. ""We can't think about who the next manager will be, we need to think about working hard in our next game."" He added on the need to start righting a few wrongs on the field: ""Everyone in the dressing room really wants to win. ""No player at this club doesn't have this desire. We know about our responsibilities - we have families, we have dreams, we have objectives. ""We want to do the work, not talk and turn this situation around. We know the quality we have, we know the expectation the fans and the club have of us and we need to be prepared to do our best to change things for the better. ""If I didn't believe we can still rescue the season then I shouldn't be here. ""We know the duty we have to meet our objectives. We can't think of the games further ahead, we have a 'final' against Norwich in front of us first."" The Red Devils are due to play host to rock-bottom Norwich on Saturday, with victory imperative in that contest after losing 1-0 to struggling Everton last time out. Telles believes that a tide can be turned, saying of the areas that United need to improve in order to hit their ultimate targets: ""We need more consistency. We've started games really well, but there are moments where the opponents have been on top and then we've lacked solidity, which has affected results. We need to keep it up for 90 minutes. ""We know how quickly things can change in football and the team that concentrates best and really focuses will be successful. So it's a case of improving our solidity and being compact.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/telles-man-utd-rescue-season-new-boss-rangnick-ten-hag/blte508451158d25afd,Chris Burton,d6f76ad8-d2ec-41dc-9227-b0ce8938af75
"Man Utd will get 'beat up' without their own Klopp, Guardiola or Tuchel, warns Neville","Manchester United have been warned that they will get ""beat up"" unless a manager of similar standing to Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel is appointed this summer, with Gary Neville seeing no way that Ralf Rangnick remains at the helm. The Red Devils turned to experienced German coach Rangnick for assistance after taking the decision to part with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021, with an interim role filled through to the end of the season. Rangick is due to head upstairs to fill a consultancy post once the current campaign comes to a close, with Neville looking for United ‚Äì who have been linked with the likes of Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag ‚Äì to bring in an inspirational leader that is capable of competing with the Premier League‚Äôs elite. Legendary former United defender Neville told his Sky Sports podcast: ‚ÄúIn the summer, they have got big appointments to make, namely the manager. ‚ÄúThe manager has got to be right next season to be able to take on Tuchel, Guardiola and Klopp because if you don't take on those three with a manager who can face them like-for-like, you will get beat up. ‚ÄúIt has been proven over the last few years that great managers in this league will bring you great things; Manchester United need a great manager to compete with the ones that are at that level in this league at this moment in time.‚Äù Rangnick‚Äôs most recent game at the helm saw United recover from throwing away a two-goal lead at old adversaries Leeds to prevail 4-2 in a thrilling encounter, with a top-four finish and Champions League qualification still very much on the cards. Neville believes the man currently calling the shots will have a big part to play in who fills the Old Trafford dugout next, but he cannot see the 63-year-old staying on regardless of how results play out from here. The ex-England international added on Rangnick: ‚ÄúI don't think he gets the job at the end of the season, come what may, now. I think maybe there was a feeling at the beginning that it could happen; that isn't going to happen. Manchester United will have a new manager next season. ‚ÄúI think he will have a say in who gets the job because what he has got is a real good view of the characters, personalities, performance levels and training levels of the current group of players so he is in a strong position to advise. ‚ÄúHe is probably in the strongest position to advise because he is having day-to-day contact with them. He is seeing how they cope with disappointment, how they cope with atmospheres, how they cope with big games, how they cope with training; can they meet the demands of the club? Have they got the quality ‚ÄúPeople say he is a sporting director and a coach, but the reality is that his position as a coach is short term; his position as assisting the club, constructing their new methodology and structure moving forward is a longer-term position for two years. I'd rather him get that bit right; I'd rather suffer in the short term for the longer-term perspective being right. ‚ÄúHe has got good experience around building structures in football clubs and Manchester United do need that.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-get-beat-up-without-own-klopp-guardiola-tuchel-warns/blt5f29a3d087d50c39,Chris Burton,e8d89c05-a54a-410f-910b-7687b9ec7a2a
Who is the world's strongest referee? Meet Brazilian match official Anderson Daronco,"Brazil is known to produce some of the finest talents in world football but did you know that the world's strongest referee too hails from the land of Samba? Anderson Daronco - who officiates matches in the Brazilian leagues and Copa America - is considered the world's strongest match official. The muscular referee has biceps that measure 44cm, weighs around 90 kg and has a height of 188 cm. Daronco has already become an internet sensation for his intimidating physique. Interestingly, in 2017, he was asked to reduce his weight by physical instructors. He shed about 4 kg and was able to run 40 meters in less than six seconds as a result. Born on January 5, 1981, in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sui in Brazil, Anderson Daronco played handball and also pursued a career as a P.E (Physical Education) teacher before becoming a professional referee.  He underwent a refereeing course at Federacao Gaucha de Futebol in Rio Grande do Sui and turned a FIFA referee in 2014. He currently officiates matches in the Brazilian top division league and international competitions like Copa America.  He is nicknamed Juiz Fortao which means Strong Judge, a name that perfectly suits his physique. During officiating a Brazilian top-flight clash between Sao Paolo and Vasco da Gama in 2019, Daronco stopped the game after hearing homophobic chants from the Vasco (home) fans. He explained the situation to the coach and then walked out of the game.  The club officials and the coach then pleaded with the fans to stop their chanting which eventually worked. The 41-year-old did manage to stop an entire stadium. Indeed a 'Strong Judge'. In the list released by FIFA on May 19, 2022, of the match officials at the FIFA World Cup which had 39 referees, 69 assistant referees and 24 video match officials. Daronco was not part of the list which means the Brazilian will not be travelling to Qatar in November.  During a Brazilian top-division clash between Atletico Mineiro and Sao Paolo, the referee was involved in an altercation with former Brazil international forward Hulk.  After the game, Hulk and Anderson Daronco were seen having a verbal exchange after the player took issue with some decisions during the game. According to Hulk, Daronco apparently told the player - ""Be careful what you say outside.""  ""I said 'why?', and he replied because it's not the last game I'll referee from (of) you. Is this a threat or not? 'I don't know. In front of my four children, it was the conversation I had with him there,' claimed the player.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/worlds-strongest-referee-anderson-daronco-brazil/blteb9a48cf93ae7736,Ritabrata Banerjee,af040465-66eb-41cf-aa3a-06be7ea811d0
"Chelsea Cucurella chant: Lyrics, video & meaning of Blues fans song for Spanish defender","Marc Cucurella made his debut for Chelsea against Everton at Goodison Park last weekend and the travelling Blues got creative to pen a chant for their new signing. The Spanish defender moved to Stamford Bridge from Brighton after Chelsea beat Manchester City and Barcelona to his signature by agreeing to pay ¬£55 million (‚Ç¨65m/$67m) plus a potential ¬£7m in add-ons. When Cucurella walked onto the pitch as a second-half substitute he was greeted with a short and catchy chant from a section of the Chelsea support. Soon the chant started echoing across the away stand and there is little doubt it is here to stay. GOAL has all the details about the chant, which carries the same tune as one that was initially made famous for Manchester United and England defender Harry Maguire. The chant dedicated to Cucurella references his Spanish heritage and ends with a nod to his unique hairstyle.  Cucurrella, Cucurella,  He eats paella, He drinks Estrella, His hair is f*cking massive (repeat ad infinitum) The Cucurella chant is fun and it mostly deals with his Spanish nationality and eye-catching hairstyle.  Just like United's chant for Maguire, it is sung to the tune of the 1950s Mexican folk song La Bamba by Ritchie Valens. Paella is a very popular Spanish dish of rice and saffron, cooked along with chicken or seafood and served in a large shallow pan. It has its origins in the Valencian region and is one of the best-known dishes of Spanish cuisine.  Meanwhile, the Estrella line references the popular beer brewed in Barcelona. The brand of lager is the oldest in the country and the Catalan and Spanish translation of ""Estrella"" means ""star"". Lastly, there is a reference to the big bundle of hair that Cucurella sports. It is believed that while he was in the developmental stages of his career at La Masia he decided to grow his hair so his mother Patricia could spot him easily from the upper tier of the stands.

'Medford Messi' Aaronson sees 'dream come true' as USMNT star flourishes in Champions League against Bayern Munich,"Brenden Aaronson admits it is a ‚Äúdream come true‚Äù to be illuminating a Champions League stage, with the United States international starring for Red Bull Salzburg in their impressive 1-1 draw with Bayern Munich in the last 16 of Europe‚Äôs premier club competition. The 21-year-old, who has earned the nickname ‚ÄòMedford Messi‚Äô after being born and raised in New Jersey, was at his creative best for Salzburg on Wednesday as they threatened to claim the notable scalp of the Bundesliga title holders. Aaronson got the critical touch that allowed Chukwubuike Adamu to fire Salzburg in front and was delighted with his overall display despite seeing Kingsley Coman snatch a last-minute equaliser for Bayern USMNT star Aaronson, who became the youngest man to create five chances in one Champions League fixture since a 20-year-old Lionel Messi achieved the same feat against Celtic in 2008, told CBS Sports of his growing influence on a continental stage: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dream come true to play on the biggest stage. And to get a result like we did, one to one, and to think that we can hold out and win the game is amazing. ‚ÄúI think for us it was just about counterattacking. We got the ball in behind and we countered really well. We were great and we have to continue to do that. Bayern are a tough team to play against with the ball, so we are going to continue to work on it and be ready for the next leg.‚Äù He added on the responsibility that comes with operating as an attacking midfielder: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs always my role as a 10, to play between the lines, and see if I can pick up the ball and try to find a final pass.

Terry thought it was a prank! - Koulibaly explains nervous call regarding Chelsea's iconic No.26,"Kalidou Koulibaly has opened up about the ""nervous"" conversation he had with Chelsea legend John Terry in which he asked to take the legend's iconic No.26 at Stamford Bridge. Koulibaly revealed that Terry initially didn't believe it was him and thought it to be a prank call. The Senegalese defender wore the number at his previous club Napoli, and was quite uncertain about asking Chelsea's ex-captain about taking the number. ""I was nervous a bit but I was really happy,"" Koulibaly said. ""He didn't believe it was me at first. He put the phone down because he didn't believe it was me."" The centre-back also said ex-Chelsea player Gianfranco Zola helped field questions about the No.26 and connect him with Terry. Koulibaly, 31, has been a name long associated with a transfer to England, with several high profile clubs reportedly keeping tabs on him over the years. However, he revealed he has only ever been close to joining one club and that was Chelsea. ""It's true that a long time the Premier League wanted me to come,"" he said. ""I believe in God, so I believe the moment was now. ""Before, no one was ready and Napoli didn't want me to go.""

United have played seven matches in all competitions under Rangnick, winning four, drawing two and losing one. The club's defence has been solid in those matches, conceding just three goals, but United have only scored eight in that time.

The team too is in a slump, picking up just one point so far to drop near the foot of the Eastern Conference.  ‚ÄúFor us to be successful he has to perform,‚Äù Neville told reporters following Saturday's 2-0 reverse at the hands of Los Angeles FC. ‚ÄúFor us to be successful, he has to perform in these moments for this team. That‚Äôs the challenge.  ""For me, and I‚Äôm really strong on this, his role hasn‚Äôt changed. He is the one that is our best finisher.  ""He is the one that we demand the most goals from. He is the one that we demand the most assists from. Period.‚Äù Despite going down to a second straight MLS defeat, ex-Manchester United defender Neville nevertheless saw signs of improvement from Inter's 5-1 drubbing to Austin FC last week. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just in that sticky period at the moment where we don‚Äôt seem to get a break, and things are just going against us,‚Äù he added.  ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs life and you've got to go through that. This is a great learning curve for this team, and the fact that they never gave in, the fact that they worked so hard, made me really proud of them.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/higuain-has-to-perform-inter-miami-boss-neville-wants-more/blt0f366da45a598db7,Daniel Edwards,0327a1dd-0363-443c-ba70-1f251c9a026f
There's something about Jack! Grealish already a Man City icon despite final-day snub,"For most ¬£100 million ($125m) players, the scrutiny at being left on the bench as your team desperately tried to clinch a Premier League title would have been unbearable.  And with Manchester City 2-0 down against his former club Aston Villa on Sunday, Jack Grealish was facing a potentially uncomfortable summer of analysis over his first year at the Etihad Stadium.  However, City's dramatic late comeback, coupled with the roguish appeal of the British transfer record-breaking signing has somehow made him the face of City's unforgettable final-day success.  Football remains his priority and, in the immediate aftermath of the thrilling title triumph, he was charming and thoughtful when asked about his first major medal and his debut campaign at City. ""I stepped out of my comfort zone to come here,"" Grealish admitted on Sky Sports. ""New changing room, new surroundings, new team-mates and everything.  ""It's been difficult, harder than I thought, but this today makes up for it. It really does.""  But from that earnest assessment onwards, he was determined to enjoy the moment, and there is no doubt that he has done just that.  Indeed, he immediately managed to coax a smile out of notriously grumpy ex-Manchester United captain Roy Keane on the Etihad Stadium pitch by inviting him to join the post-match celebrations. The Irishman politely declined, but fellow TV pundit, and Grealish's former Aston Villa team-mate, Micah Richards threatened to come along. In the end, though, the latter was fast asleep while Grealish and his team-mates were partying the night away at the Ivy restaurant and the China White nightclub.  And, after a short interval, the drinks started to flow again the following day as the champions revelled with the club's fans, which is when Grealish's allure grew even more.  On the bus through Manchester city centre, the 26-year-old led the sing-song with supporters before emerging on to the stage to a huge cheer, wearing sunglasses and clutching a bottle of beer and a glass of spirits in the other.  When Riyad Mahrez asked fans who was the only winger to beat Kyle Walker, Grealish grabbed the microphone and interjected: ""Me, when I was at Aston Villa! That‚Äôs why Pep Guardiola signed me!"" The laughing City boss enjoyed the intervention, just as he has enjoyed the England international's character since he arrived at the club last summer. While there is clearly more to come on the pitch, he has added a positive presence to the dressing room that has been noticed by the backroom staff and been beneficial in such a fraught end-of-season battle with Liverpool. That charisma has been observed elsewhere too, with fashion label Gucci signing him up as their new star, with his modelling debut unveiled in The Face magazine in the same week he picked up his first medal.  Jack Grealish is having a great time üòÇ pic.twitter.com/GOxdwfkwTk But while there's a hint of former England hero David Beckham about his style, it's his cheeky persona, which is reminiscent of his predecessor Paul Gascoigne, that makes him such a popular every-man.  Rather than sulk over his non-appearance on the final day, which many a star would have done, Grealish chose to own it.  First came the audacious digs at his team-mates on the end-of-season parade.  ""The main person I want to thank is Bernardo Silva for coming off in the 70th minute, because he was miles off it!"" he told the club's website.  Later, he added on Bernardo's Instagram video: ""Riyad ‚Äì take him off the pitch as soon as possible! He played like [Newcastle's Miguel] Almiron.""  When the Portuguese hit back, ""Keep Jack Grealish on the f*cking bench!"", the England star disappeared in fits of laughter.  After another big night, Grealish then took to Instagram to post of himself in Ibiza with Gary Lineker's party-loving brother Wayne.  Jack Grealish's celebrations continue in Ibiza üòÖüì∏ @waynelineker pic.twitter.com/gahkhsMkEK There is, of course, a fine balance between letting off steam and over-indulgence, but Guardiola has never been afraid to allow his players to enjoy themselves when they have free time.  In an age of big personalities and prima donnas, it makes for a refreshing change to get a close-up view of someone so genuine and earnest.  This is clearly a young man living his best life and happy in his own skin.  Grealish will join up with England for their Nations League fixtures later this week, hungry to secure a place in the World Cup squad and a place in Gareth Southgate's starting line-up.  Then, in July, he will be back in Manchester ahead of a US tour, determined to bring even more personality and quality to the table after a mixed first season.  Guardiola and his coaches have never doubted the Birmingham native's potential and ability to grow into the team.  But before the hard work restarts, you get the feeling that Grealish is going to have a great summer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/something-about-jack-grealish-won-over-man-city-fans-title/blte1cff9f9110e2402,Jonathan Smith,2ea12223-51c5-455a-8540-87c7e2335b31
Raphinha agrees personal terms with Barcelona but transfer talks with Leeds on hold until Premier League season is over,"Raphinha has agreed personal terms on a summer transfer to Barcelona, GOAL has learned, but negotiations with Leeds have been put on hold until the end of the season as both clubs have more pressing concerns at present. Those at Elland Road are still sweating on their Premier League status, with one more crucial fixture left to take in during their battle to beat the drop, while directors at Camp Nou are working on freeing up space in Xavi‚Äôs squad and salary cap for further reinforcements to be drafted in. It is understood that a deal with Brazil international Raphinha is being lined up, on a contract that will see his salary doubled, with terms that will take him through to 2027 now drawn up in Catalunya. The 25-year-old forward, who has seven senior caps to his name, is represented by former Barca star Deco ‚Äì who he has been working with since June 2021. Contact with Leeds has been made through the ex-Portugal international, with the Whites making it clear that they will only enter into full discussions once their domestic campaign has come to a close following a trip to Brentford on Sunday. Raphinha will be hoping to steer his current club to safety, but a significant reduction in his release clause will be triggered if a side managed by American coach Jesse Marsch suffer relegation out of the English top flight. If Leeds were to tumble into the Championship, then Barca would be able to acquire the highly-rated South American for ‚Ç¨25 million (¬£21m/$26m). The Liga giants are yet to put an official offer on the table, but Raphinha has made it clear to those in West Yorkshire that he wants to leave ‚Äì with efforts to get him tied down on a new contract having come to nothing. Raphinha is in talks with Barcelona over a summer move ü•∂ pic.twitter.com/mFFIEvZvXm Raphinha now his heart set on making a move to Barcelona, but there are a number of hurdles to clear before any transfer can be pushed through. Xavi has admitted as much over recent weeks, with the Blaugrana boss stating that departures need to be sanctioned over the summer before arrivals can be welcomed through the doors. The plan is, having already offloaded Philippe Coutinho to Aston Villa on a permanent basis, to get more big earners off the books in the coming weeks ‚Äì with the potential there for the likes of Samuel Umtiti, Clement Lenglet, Neto and Frenkie de Jong to be offloaded, while Ousmane Dembele is heading towards free agency. Without bringing in funds and reducing their wage bill, Barca will be unable to register those that they have their eye on. Raphinha is now waiting in the wings, while personal terms have also been agreed with AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie and Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen ‚Äì two players that will be out of contract at the end of the 2021-22 and can be acquired without the need for a fee to change hands.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/raphinha-agrees-personal-terms-barcelona-transfer-leeds/blte37a8c207df610c6,Thiago Fernandes,e8a69671-e6ae-4e62-bf4d-5fa43a0cb803
"No coach, no owner, no chance? RSL both the underdogs and villains of MLS Playoffs","The world is so often painted in black and white: heroes against villains. And, in the grand scheme of things, Real Salt Lake has all the makings of a team that every neutral could get behind. However, as they sit one step away from a spot in MLS Cup, this season's biggest underdogs have also been led by a player that has cast himself as 2021's main villain, a role that this postseason's breakout star has embraced amid a tumultuous season that has seen the team overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to reach this point. RSL are, in many ways, the little team that could. Always one of the lowest-spending teams in MLS, Real Salt Lake find themselves in the Conference finals this weekend, having beaten two of the league's best-run clubs in the run-up. And they did so amid one of the most tumultuous seasons in recent memory.  The club remains without an actual owner, just over a year removed from Dell Loy Hansen's ousting amid accusations of racism and a toxic workplace. MLS has since taken over the running of the club, leaving RSL in a limbo while awaiting new ownership. The club also lost its head coach Freddy Juarez midseason, as he departed for Seattle Sounders. And not for a job as a head coach, but as an assistant at another MLS club.  He was replaced by MLS legend Pablo Mastroeni, who remains employed on an interim basis given the ownership situation. Yet in spite of all of this drama, here Real Salt Lake are, in the Western Conference final with the 20th-ranked payroll in the league.  They took down the aforementioned Sounders, with Juarez on the bench, in the first round of the MLS playoffs without registering a shot. They then went into Kansas City and beat Sporting KC on a late winner from Bobby Wood, a former U.S. men's national team star that came off the bench to create a moment of magic.  Having already beaten SKC to even get into the playoffs, RSL pulled it off again, actually taking the game to Sporting KC after grinding out a result in Seattle.  And did so without their star player Albert Rusnak, who looks set to return for the Western Conference final after missing the start of the playoffs due to a positive Covid-19 test. It all begs the question: how the hell have they gotten this far? ""I think the group has really taken on this persona of 'Why not us?'"" Mastroeni said. ""We were picked to finish bottom of the West, bottom of the league at the beginning of the season. ""I think initially you surprise yourself as the season goes on but at some point you get to this realization that you can compete with the best teams in this league and the difference is showing up on the day and having the right mentality, sticking to the game plan and most importantly, as a group, believing in each other, believing in yourself."" One player who has little issue with believing in himself is goalkeeper David Ochoa, who has emerged as the star of the show in the postseason. We don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the villain üòà pic.twitter.com/yAcyxiZgn3 His performance against the Sounders in round one? Legendary, for several reasons. One is, of course, the shutout and the penalty shootout win in one of MLS' most hostile stadiums. The other is the way they got there. Ochoa is no stranger to controversy, having punted a ball into the supporters‚Äô section at Allianz Field after a win over¬†Minnesota United earlier this year. But he cast himself as Public Enemy No. 1 in Seattle with his mastery of the Dark Arts. It was a masterclass of time-wasting, from milking the clock to ""losing the ball"" while attempting skills prior to a goalkick. He ran at the referee to protest a yellow, faked an injury or two, delayed shots during the shootout. It was also a masterclass in angering a crowd as Ochoa repeatedly trash-talked Seattle's players and fans. ‚ÄúI enjoy being the villain, I love when people are talking smack to me,‚Äù Ochoa said after leading RSL past Seattle.  ‚ÄúI feel like it makes me play better. Today, I tried playing the villain a little bit and making sure that Seattle wasn't getting in a rhythm. ‚ÄúWith that, I had to slow time a little and with that I also got a yellow card. But after the yellow card I was a little smarter just in case I didn't get the red card. But I enjoy being the villain and I don't think I'll ever stop.‚Äù Added Mastroeni: ""I knew he was going to be lights out because I think when he takes on that persona he's dialed in and that's his way of staying present, staying focused and coming up with big plays.‚Äù Ochoa's persona doesn't limit him to stopping on-field shots either. He's perfectly comfortable taking them as well. Following the win over Seattle, Ochoa referred to Sounders boss Brian Schmetzer, a two-time MLS Cup winner as ""¬†Brian whatever his last name is"" before calling out the coach's comments about mentality. Schmetzer had said that he believed his Sounders had a better mentality, having held RSL to zero shots, but Ochoa fired back. This is art. Put David Ochoa in the Louvre. pic.twitter.com/E5oqEba4zW ""We think that there's no better mentally than having zero shots on goal and still winning the game,"" said Ochoa. ""I think that's the biggest mentality that there is.¬†"" And after leading RSL past Sporting KC, Ochoa took to Instagram Live to call out MLS Young Player of the Year Ricardo Pepi, a player he calls a friend, saying should give back his award. ‚ÄúI thought that was a little disrespectful, just knowing my quality and the guys that were named above me,‚Äù Ochoa told ESPN. ‚ÄúI would say at least top five.  ""But like I said, that stuff makes me work harder and makes me better. That's just the way I go about things and yeah, I did say that about Pepi. Me and Pepi have a good relationship so it wasn't too serious. It was more of a little humor between friends.‚Äù Real Salt Lake now face their most serious challenge yet in the Portland Timbers, but the door is open for this fairy tale to continue. When the two teams collide this weekend, the Timbers will likely be without their star player Sebastian Blanco due to injury. They'll definitely be without a key starter in Dairon Asprilla after he was sent off in the Timbers' win over the Colorado Rapids. So, when does this Cinderella story come to an end and, when and if it does, how will it be remembered? Will 2021 be the year the underdog, the year of the villain or both? Can RSL really pull this thing off? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just shutting a couple mouths up as we go and we‚Äôre loving it man,‚Äù Ochoa told ESPNFC.  ‚ÄúWe're in a good spot right now. We're feeling confident. I think we're going to get another result again on Saturday versus Portland.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rsl-emerging-underdogs-villains-mls-playoffs/blt44aa84fe304dea4e,Ryan Tolmich,a0bb0f8a-03eb-41e0-885b-6c651d68ac89

Klopp & Liverpool left sweating as Jota sent for scan amid fears of hamstring injury blow,"Liverpool have been handed an untimely injury blow ahead of the 2022-23 season, with it revealed that Diogo Jota is to undergo tests after picking up another hamstring problem. The Portugal international has already damaged that muscle once this summer when away on UEFA Nations League duty with his country. He was able to join up with Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs squad in Thailand ahead of a friendly date with Manchester United, but played no part in that fixture and has now suffered another fitness setback during training and is due to undergo a scan in Singapore. Liverpool are yet to put a timescale on Jota‚Äôs recovery, but Jurgen Klopp admits that the immediate outlook does not look good for the 25-year-old forward. The Reds boss has said: ‚ÄúDiogo, unlucky eh? He had an injury from the end of last season. ‚ÄúHe trained yesterday fully and got injured again. That‚Äôs really not cool. ‚ÄúWe have to wait for the results and he had an assessment this morning. Then we have to see. ‚ÄúIs it his hamstring? We will see.

Madrid overturned a two-goal deficit in the last-16 second leg, with Karim Benzema's second-half hat-trick sealing a 3-2 aggregate victory for Madrid. It was the first of Benzema's three goals which enraged PSG, who felt Benzema should have been called for a foul on goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the build-up.

Chiellini confirms LAFC transfer as Juventus legend completes MLS move,"Giorgio Chiellini has confirmed he has joined LAFC on a free transfer after the expiration of his contract at Juventus. His deal to come to MLS takes him to Hollywood for the final stretch of his decorated career.

Mohamed Salah: Ronaldinho advises ‚Äòone of the best' on Liverpool future,"Barcelona legend Ronaldinho Gaucho has answered a question on Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah's future. The 29-year-old Egypt international has been among the key players for the Anfield outfit in the current campaign, helping the team to clinch the League Cup and FA Cup trophies and also reach the final of the Champions League.

The Egyptian‚Äôs current contract expires in the summer of 2023 and the Reds will be wary of losing Salah on a free transfer unless fresh terms can be agreed.

Mbappe 'radiant' with France national team amid PSG turmoil - Deschamps,"Amid a tumultuous period at club level with Paris Saint-Germain, Kylian Mbappe is ""radiant"" and constantly smiling behind the scenes at France national team camp, according to head coach Didier Deschamps. Mbappe and his club team-mates suffered a heartbreaking Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid earlier this month, with the Ligue 1 outfit blowing a two-goal aggregate lead in the span of 29 minutes. Still, the forward, who has had personal issues in the past with his national team, appears to be in excellent spirits. ""Since he arrived, he has been radiant, smiling,"" said Deschamps to reporters.  ""Football is hard, but [the Champions League defeat to Real Madrid] is already behind. He is part of the group, knows that he is an important, decisive player. It's not Kylian and the band, it's Kylian in the band."" When Mbappe first arrived to greet his France compatriots, there was a hint of a sour mood as he appeared to tell Pogba he was feeling ""fed up"" at PSG. And in the past, Mbappe has had an up-and-down relationship with Les Bleus, feuding with Olivier Giroud last summer and publicly airing grievances after Euro 2020. Now, though, his head coach sees a renewed level of energy as the team begins preparation for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. It's going to be a huge year for Mbappe on multiple fronts, as beyond the World Cup he will also decide whether to join Real Madrid in the summer transfer window.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-radiant-with-france-national-team-amid-psg-turmoil/blt932ce55e148674e9,Dan Bernstein,85b04911-22df-4537-9467-c85a27bebfee

Watch: England players invade Wiegman press conference to sing 'It's coming home',"Sarina Wiegman's efforts to speak to the press following England's Euro 2022 victory were interrupted on Sunday due to a joyous invasion from her triumphant squad. The Lionesses were in a party mood after beating Germany after extra-time to lift their first Euro title. And they made their delight known to the world as Wiegman looked on, singing the famous 'Three Lions' anthem and climbing on the table to dance in front of their stunned, but amused manager. For the uninitiated, 'football's coming home' is a famous line from an iconic English football anthem called 'Three Lions'. The song, which was first released in May 1996 by Frank Skinner, David Baddiel and The Lightning Seeds, initially served as the soundtrack to Euro 96. A new version of the song was released ahead of the 1998 World Cup, but the chorus remained the same. 'Three Lions' was resurrected ahead of the 2018 World Cup and again at Euro 2020, with fans of the England women's team deploying it regularly at the Women's Euro 2022 along with 'Sweet Caroline'.

'I could not believe what I saw' - Tuchel salutes Chalobah bravery for playing on after Keita tackle,"Thomas Tuchel has saluted Trevor Chalobah's resolve after the Chelsea defender played through the pain barrier in Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Liverpool, with the German adding the centre-back needed stitches after the final whistle following Naby Keita's tackle. The youngster was involved in a nasty challenge with the Reds midfielder at Wembley over the weekend, but soldiered on as the Blues came up short in a mammoth 11-10 penalty shootout loss following a 0-0 draw after extra-time. While Chalobah's bravery following Keita's less-than-auspicious tackle has been somewhat eclipsed by Tuchel's own tactical gambles late on, the manager was more than happy to hail his player's fortitude, recounting the tough post-match scenes he heard down the corridor. ‚ÄúI could not believe what I saw after the match,"" Tuchel stated. ""There was surgery literally in our dressing room and I am not joking. They were stitching him up. I could not believe it. After the match, they were doing the stitches, I just heard him scream. It looked horrible. ""I could not believe he played one more minute with this kind of injury but he played the rest of the match and scored a penalty. I would say he has shown some balls but that would be the wrong line but he was really brave to do this. Full credit to him. ‚Äú[It was] very close to his... You could not look away. It was open and it needed to be closed. We are working on it. He was very tough and he has my full respect.‚Äù Chalobah's injury means that he is expected to be absent for Chelsea's immediate return to knockout action, as the Blues face Championship outfit Luton Town in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday. Having secured two trophies already this term in the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, Tuchel will hope to add to his haul, knowing that the Premier League title race is now likely beyond his side as Manchester City and Liverpool continue to fight it out at the top. Subsequent games against Burnley and Newcastle United might still come too soon for Chalobah to return, but he could well be in the frame to feature in his side's Champions League second leg with Lille in a fortnight.

Liverpool‚Äôs Mane reveals how Mendy saved his penalty for Chelsea in FA Cup triumph,"Liverpool winger Sadio Mane has explained his relationship with Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy and how he managed to save his penalty in the 6-5 FA Cup shootout win at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. The two Premier League giants came face to face again ‚Äì having met in the League Cup ‚Äì and it was Liverpool who carried the day even after the 30-year-old Mane had seen his penalty saved by Senegal teammate Mendy. With Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta missing their second penalty and Liverpool putting in the net all their first four, the Lion of Teranga was presented with a great chance to clinch the game for the Reds. Mane came face to face with his Senegal counterpart Mendy but his right-footed effort was stopped by the 30-year-old custodian, who forced the game into the sixth penalty to be taken. It was Mason Mount, who missed yet again for Chelsea, and Liverpool had another chance to seal the game, which Konstantinos Tsimikas took with both hands, to send Mendy the wrong way and hand Liverpool their second trophy in this campaign, having won the League Cup also on penalties. Asked whether Mendy has been watching him take penalties, Mane told reporters after the game: ‚ÄúOf course, we know each other, we‚Äôre friends and we talk to each other all the time. I thought the left side was not his best side so that's why I put it there, but he managed to save it.‚Äù Mane has also maintained Liverpool will put up a proper fight for the remaining two titles. Liverpool are currently chasing the Premier League title alongside Manchester City and are also in the final of the Champions League where they will face Real Madrid on May 28 at Stade de France. ‚ÄúWe have two more to go for, so we will give it a proper fight. You can see that we gave our all to win this trophy,‚Äù Mane continued. ‚ÄúI am very proud, very happy to win this trophy because it is why we're working so hard together to win these trophies. I think it is just something special for me.‚Äù In an earlier interview, Mane said he did not care about missing from the penalty spot. ‚ÄúI think all the credit to Alisson, because myself, I missed the penalty but who cares? The most important thing is to win the cup and we did it,‚Äù Mane said. ‚ÄúAlisson, all the credit for him. I am happy for him and we are all happy and proud.‚Äù Liverpool will shift focus to the league where they face Southampton at Anfield on Tuesday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-s-mane-reveals-how-mendy-saved-his-penalty-for-chelsea-/bltb8381db7ad9f2d17,Dennis Mabuka,52253887-d4a6-4e56-8d35-437ad836366f

Despite the Yellow Submarine leading 2-0 at half-time, they failed to reach the final as the Premier League side scored three second-half goals through Fabinho, Luis Diaz and the Senegal international.

The last time he hit the target in Europe was against Inter Milan on February 16 in the Round of 16 as Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men secured a 2-0 away win in Italy. On whether he sets himself goals and assists targets each season, Salah told the Liverpool website: ‚ÄúAlways. Before the season starts I know what I want from the season individually and collectively, for sure.¬† ‚ÄúThe collective is the most important thing and the first target for the season as well.

The attacker was seen undergoing medical attention for what appeared to be his front tooth dangling loosely from his gums during a 2-0 victory over the Gunners. But his smile has been sorted in quick time, with the England forward taking to social media to show that he is in good spirits. Footage captured at the game showed Wilson apparently missing a tooth that had been knocked loose near the front of his mouth.

Reyna fit again in boost for USMNT ahead of decisive 2022 World Cup qualifiers as Haaland also returns for Dortmund,"Giovanni Reyna is set to return for Borussia Dortmund this weekend in the Bundesliga alongside Erling Haaland, in what is a timely boost to the US men's national team ahead of their crucial Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers later this month. The USMNT starlet, alongside his Norway international colleague, have both been plagued by injury over recent weeks, with the former facing a race against time to prove himself fit for Gregg Berhalter's crucial trio of matches at the end of March. But now Dortmund boss Marco Rose has revealed that the duo have not only been in training this week but could make a full return to the pitch in this weekend's clash against Arminia Bielefeld. ""Reyna has been training with the team again for a week and can be an option for Bielefeld."" the coach told his pre-match press conference when discussing his options. ""Erling [too] is actually an option for the weekend. Not for longer, but for a part-time job."" Dortmund will be without Steffen Tigges, however, after the striker broke his ankle in midweek. The return of Reyna to action will be not only a huge boost for club but for country too, with the England-born teenager looking to add to his nine caps across a run of vital matches. Though the USMNT sit among the frontrunners to make Qatar 2022, they are not yet secured of their place and must face three rivals all vying to take their spot later this month.

Messi to show off acting chops as PSG star set to appear in comedy drama 'Los Protectores',"Lionel Messi is no stranger to putting on a show on the pitch, but the Paris Saint-Germain star is about to put his skills to a very different test after it was revealed he will appear in a television show. The Argentina star is set to feature in Los Protectores, a series made in his native country, after temporarily trading his boots for the bright lights of the small screen. With a World Cup looming at Qatar 2022 and another year on his contract at Parc des Princes, fans need not worry that it is the end of a highly successful career - but the forward might just have another magic touch on his hands. The Argentine will appear in the second season of Los Protectores, a comedy-drama that tracks the fortunes of three football agents who, in order to stave off bankruptcy, make an alliance to represent a major international star. Messi is expected to have a small role in the global production, which will air its next run in 2023, and was able to film his scenes while playing in Paris, impressing his co-stars. ""It really surprised us all, not only with his quality as a person but also with his acting quality,"" actor Andres Parra stated. Messi is far from the first football superstar to take time out from their busy schedule for a television role - in fact, he is not even the first PSG player. Former Barcelona team-mate Neymar made a memorable cameo on the hit Netflix series Money Heist, while David Beckham had a brief turn on a charity special of the popular British sitcom Only Fools and Horses.

'Nobody thinks about the players!' - Klopp slams UEFA over hectic fixture list amid Liverpool injury crisis,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has once again hit out at UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin over the high workload placed on footballers due to the hectic fixture list. The top-ranking UEFA official had previously said that salaries would go down if there were less matches in a direct response to criticism from Klopp and Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. Ceferin also stated that ""those who should complain are the workers with a thousand euros a month in the factories"", and Klopp has now continued their war of words amid an ongoing injury crisis at Anfield. ""I know what work means. I don't want to offend anyone, just to point out again that this game doesn't work without the players and is only really nice when the best are on the field,"" the German manager said in an interview with Kicker.  ""Aleksander Ceferin comes out of the corner¬†and makes a polemical statement¬†that other people have to work a lot more. I know that, Mr. Ceferin doesn't have to tell me that."" Klopp went on to insist that there are too many stakeholders working to create extra tournaments without caring about the players' physical wellbeing.  ""Everyone pulls (new tournaments), nobody thinks about the players,"" he added. ""Not one.¬†New tournaments are always being invented. Now we're making the World Cup bigger so that other teams can also take part. We're also making the European Championship bigger, amazing!  ""A reasonable solution must be found. It does not consist of constantly inventing new competitions and extending them.¬†It's madness. ""I'm well aware that I'm making an extremely good living from the whole story. I have enough vacation time. The players don't have it. We have to change that at some point.""

'That's why he's special' - Son on Tottenham's reaction to Conte meltdown after Burnley loss,"Son Heung-min has opened up on the Tottenham squad's reaction to Antonio Conte's meltdown after their loss to Burnley. Spurs looked to have taken a huge step towards Champions League qualification after a dramatic 3-2 win away at leaders Manchester City on February 19, but came crashing back down to earth against Burnley four days later. A 1-0 loss at Turf Moor handed the initiative back to their top-four rivals, and Conte vented his frustration to reporters post-match. The Italian tactician raised fears that he could walk away from Tottenham as he suggested that they should be focusing on not getting drawn into a relegation battle instead of trying to finish fourth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to do everything to change the situation but the situation is not changing,"" said Conte. ""Someone has to speak about the race for the fourth place, and the reality from the last five games is we have to pay attention to not fight for the relegation zone. This is the truth. This is the reality. ‚ÄúWhen this type of situation happens, maybe there is something wrong. From the first day I arrived here I want to help Tottenham. I repeat: I am too honest to close my eyes and continue in this way, and also take my salary.

Speaking after Spurs bounced back with a 4-0 win at Leeds on Saturday, the South Korean forward said: ‚ÄúObviously we were all frustrated after the result. Obviously we know we can do better, especially with Burnley [because] we know how difficult that place is. ‚ÄúWe let ourselves down and we were disappointed.

How many Premier League players are vaccinated?,"With the Omicron variant of Covid-19 causing a new record-high case total in the UK, the Premier League has had to call of several matches with clubs suffering from outbreaks of the virus. December has accounted for the highest number of positive tests returned by Premier League players in the 2021-22 season, with concerns that the virus could be spread during matches. So how many Premier League players have received the Covid-19 vaccine, and which clubs are fully vaccinated? GOAL takes a look. The Premier League has confirmed that 92 per cent of players and club staff have received one, two or three COVID-19 vaccination doses, with 84 per cent of players ""on the vaccination journey"". The division does not release specific details about which clubs and individuals have received vaccinations, but over all vaccination rates will now be released once a month starting in January 2022. The Premier League has encouraged all clubs ‚Äì¬†including staff¬†‚Äì¬†to get vaccinated, stating: ""The League continues to work with clubs to encourage vaccination among players and club staff, as well as promoting the Government‚Äôs public-health vaccination messaging to clubs and the wider public."" While the Premier League does not state which individuals are vaccinated, clubs have released their own information about the vaccine statuses of their players and staff. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has confirmed that everyone at the training ground has received at least two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. ‚ÄúEveryone working at the AXA training ground is at least double vaccinated and will get the booster as soon as possible,"" Klopp told reporters prior to Liverpool's victory against Newcastle. The Reds boss has been very vocal about being vaccinated against Covid-19, stating that it is the responsibility of the individual to protect not themselves against the virus, but their entire community. ‚ÄúThe whole vaccination thing is, for me, a question of solidarity, loyalty and togetherness. ‚ÄúWe all have the chance to help not only ourselves but other people as well by getting vaccinated. There is only one answer ‚Äî you do it. That's how I understand it."" Bruno Lage has also stated that ""everyone in the Wolves building"" has been double-vaccinated and been given the booster jab, echoing Klopp's words that doing so is crucial in stopping the spread of Covid-19. Lage said: ‚ÄúWhen I came here, they gave me the chance to be vaccinated and I accepted. It was important for me because I have my family in Portugal and when I have days off, I go there to spend time with my wife and kids, so I took my vaccinations.¬† ‚ÄúEveryone in our building is fully vaccinated, which is the right thing to do, especially with the increase in positive cases in the Premier League and wider society.

Atletico's ‚Ç¨126m 'flop' Joao Felix finally proving his worth ahead of Man Utd clash,"Joao¬†Felix¬†is an Atletico Madrid legend ‚Äì technically.¬† The Portuguese forward became the club‚Äôs record signing in 2019 and after reaching 100 games for the club in February, earned his plaque on the ‚Äòlegends‚Äô walk‚Äô at the Wanda Metropolitano. However, purely on performances, nobody would bestow him ‚Äòlegend‚Äô status yet. Atletico Madrid‚Äôs ‚Ç¨126 million (¬£106m/$138m) man has flattered to deceive, until now. His goal against Manchester United was a recent high among multiple in 2022, with¬†Felix¬†enjoying his best form since arriving from Benfica. He has the price tag of a superstar, the fourth most expensive player of all time, but has only shown his quality in flashes and moments. Consistency has eluded him and even during Atletico‚Äôs title triumph last season, his contributions were overshadowed by those of his team-mates.¬† Luis Suarez was the key figure with 21 league goals, followed by Marcos Llorente with 12 and Angel Correa with nine, ahead of¬†Felix‚Äôs seven. The Portuguese striker‚Äôs five assists were beaten by Kieran Trippier, Correa, Yannick Carrasco and Llorente. His move to Atletico never looked a perfect fit, with coach Diego Simeone‚Äôs renowned defensive outlook not necessarily the best home for a gifted creative. The hope was that¬†Felix¬†could follow the Antoine Griezmann roadmap, who was Barcelona-bound the same summer. Under Simeone‚Äôs guidance, Griezmann transformed from a promising winger into one of the world‚Äôs best forwards, winning the 2018 World Cup with France. However¬†Felix‚Äôs first two-and-a-half seasons with the club have not seen him blossom into the star he was expected to be, and Simeone snatched Griezmann back from Barcelona last summer to supplement the attack. Felix¬†would not be the first forward to fail at Atletico Madrid, with Alessio Cerci, Jackson Martinez, Luciano Vietto and various others not meshing with Simeone. Having only played 26 games in Portugal‚Äôs Primeira Liga, many believe Atletico were too hasty to snap up¬†Felix¬†and drastically overpaid for the then 19-year-old. But beyond the odd exception, it takes time to mould a teenager into a world-class talent. A few miles away in the Spanish capital, Real Madrid are finally getting the best of Vinicius Junior, for example. And in the last few weeks,¬†Felix, 22, seems to have turned a corner. And with him, Atletico, from a season that quickly fell into frustration and struggle from the joyous highs of their title success.¬† Felix‚Äôs Champions League display against Manchester United in February was one of his finest in an Atletico Madrid shirt. The forward broke the deadlock with a superb header that left former Atletico goalkeeper David de Gea with no chance, created danger with his dribbling and could only be stopped by foul means more often than fair.¬† It might have provided the Rojiblancos with a famous victory, but their defensive frailty allowed Anthony Elanga to equalise and leave the tie finely poised, ahead of Tuesday night‚Äôs second leg at Old Trafford. Atletico fans voted¬†Felix¬†their player of the month for February and he has five goals in his last five games across all competitions. Four of them have come in the first seven minutes of matches, ‚Äòopening the can‚Äô for Simeone. The pity is that it has taken this long for¬†Felix¬†to click into gear, with an ankle injury in the second half of last season partly to blame. It cemented Correa and Suarez as Atletico‚Äôs best options as they drove towards the title and contributed to the stop-start beginning to this campaign. After missing the opening three games Simeone handed him a couple of substitute appearances, and he was sent off in the second, against Athletic Bilbao. A further calf injury sidelined him for three more games, including the 1-0 home defeat by AC Milan in the Champions League. Then he missed Atletico‚Äôs first win after four straight La Liga defeats with Covid-19.¬† Felix¬†has only completed the 90 minutes five times this season, although his goal glut and improving work rate and focus on the pitch have earned him five consecutive starts. With extra minutes comes confidence, and with confidence comes goals. The first in his recent run was against Osasuna in a 3-0 win, an immediate reaction after Atletico‚Äôs worst result of the season, a 1-0 home defeat by bottom of the table Levante on February 16. Simeone liked what he saw from¬†Felix¬†and the team. ‚ÄúOne more from the flop,‚Äù wrote his brother Hugo sarcastically on Twitter, after the striker broke the deadlock against Real Betis on March 6, the first of a brace.¬†¬† And it was¬†Felix¬†again who struck a third-minute goal against Cadiz last Friday to keep Atletico fourth in La Liga. ‚ÄúIf at times he‚Äôs sinned, with a certain disconnection, now he is motivated and enjoying himself,‚Äù wrote Madrid-based newspaper AS.¬† There has been a lot of speculation about a departure from Atletico in the summer, although that was before his recent surge. Now he is threatening to make good on his potential, Atletico will be loathed¬†to let him go, and his contract runs until 2026. The numbers are starting to reflect his quality.¬†Felix¬†ranks seventh in La Liga for non-penalty goals and assists per 90 minutes and is climbing.¬† He is on course for his best goalscoring season in Spain with eight in total already, two behind the 10 he managed in 2020-21, speaking to both his prior struggles and his current improvement. ‚ÄúEverybody needs time and he is doing what we ask of him,‚Äù enthused Simeone. ‚ÄúAbove all he adds goals, talent, one on one ability, vision of the game, speed, he‚Äôs good in the air, works in his zone defensively, and all of that is great for him. ""He‚Äôll get mad and he‚Äôll be mad at me, but one day he‚Äôll thank me.‚Äù Perhaps the most crucial aspect ‚Äì unsurprisingly ‚Äì is¬†Felix‚Äôs increased running. With Griezmann as an example, he now understands sometimes he must sacrifice himself for the team, gritting his teeth and defending. In return, he gets more time to shine, and his form has seen Simeone bench Suarez. As much as the Uruguayan would love to face Manchester United, it is¬†Felix‚Äôs spot to lose now. He finally has Simeone‚Äôs trust. And he will be playing not just to keep it, but to earn legend status on the pitch and in Atletico hearts, and not just in the archives.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/flop-atletico-126m-joao-felix-finally-proving-worth-man-utd/blt65977501228ede2c,Rik Sharma,c0878e50-000f-4288-a37f-f3e4b650a70a
"'I was angry, but it was my fault' - Flachi on cocaine ban after making football comeback 12 years after last game","Ex-Fiorentina and Sampdoria star Francesco Flachi admitted he was forced to change his life after spending more than a decade out of the game due to a drugs ban. Flachi received a 12-year suspension in 2010 after testing positive for cocaine while at Brescia. At the age of 46, and with his ban finally over, he made a shock comeback in the fifth tier in February for local side Signa 1914. ""It was a really long time, even if now it seems to have passed quickly. It was a long time and not at all easy mentally,"" Flachi told Fanpage. ""Because it changes your life and it is not easy: I had to reinvent myself, since due to the ban I could not be registered with anybody, at most I could have some collaboration.¬† ""At the beginning, in reality, I had only a little to do with football, not the fault of the others but my fault. The striker, who played alongside Gabriel Batistuta at Fiorentina and later scored almost 100 goals for Sampdoria at his peak, added that his return to the game was almost a chance event. ""It could be said that it came from a coincidence,"" he explained. ""There was a seven-a-side football tournament here in Signa, I was part of the team and therefore the president came to see¬†me play. ""He teased and motivated me by telling me that I was no longer that good, even though I was playing well, and after he told me once, twice, three, four times I told him to give me a try.  ""In that moment it was a thing just to say, like a far-fetched one. Then but the more time passed, we felt, talked and slowly it became more and more interesting.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/flachi-cocaine-ban-comeback-12-years/blt0504a6155c26ae3a,Daniel Edwards,567e239b-f735-465c-84e6-82fa4f1ef420
Giant mural of Man City's Guardiola kissing Roma's Mourinho spotted at Barcelona's Primavera music festival,"A giant mural depicting Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola and Roma boss Jose Mourinho kissing has been put on display in Barcelona.  The massive painting has been put up at the Primavera Sound Festival. The image is a twist on the iconic mural that portrayed ex-Soviet Union leader Leonid Brezhnev and his former German Democratic Republic counterpart Erich Honecker at the Berlin Wall.  The mural that was unveiled at the festival, which ran for 11 days from June 2 to June 12, showed the two coaches in a passionate kiss. A mural of Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho at the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona üòò pic.twitter.com/NBwhxYSS5E It included the message: ""My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love,"" which was also written on the original Brezhnev-Honecker mural. There is also another message beside the mural, saying: ""Barcelona + Madrid = Primavera Sound. Diversity, Culture, Tolerance."" The artwork originally showed between Ada Colau, mayor of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand Isabel Diaz Ayuso, president of the Community of Madrid, in a passionate kiss as a depiction of love between the two cities. However, the two figures were subsequently replaced by Guardiola and Mourinho. A fierce rivalry between the two coaches erupted when Guardiola was coach of Barcelona and Mourinho was in charge of Real Madrid. The two teams were involved in a series of intense La Liga and Champions League matches. Their sides came up against each other 11 times and resulted in tensions reaching a new high when they met four times in 18 days¬†in La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey. Mourinho's comments in press conferences eventually got the better of Guardiola, who had an outburst in front of reporters. ""Off the pitch he's won. He's been winning off the pitch all season,"" he said.  ""Let them give him a Champions League for it so he can enjoy it and take it home.

Ajax & Cameroon goalkeeper Onana involved in car accident as he escapes with no injuries,"Cameroon goalkeeper Andre Onana has been involved in a serious car accident ahead of their 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifier against Algeria. The Ajax shot-stopper was reportedly on his way to Doula from the capital city Yaounde on Tuesday morning when the incident happened.  However, he survived the accident that involved three vehicles without serious injury. So far, no casualties have been reported.

Ozil removed from Fenerbahce squad as unhappy spell in Turkey for ex-Arsenal star continues,"Mesut Ozil was fulfilling a boyhood dream when linking up with Fenerbahce, but a stint in Turkey has turned into something of a nightmare for the former Arsenal star and he has been removed from the squad of his current employers. The 2014 World Cup winner severed ties with the Gunners in January 2021 and embraced an opportunity to link up with the team that he grew up supporting. He has, however, found the going tough in Istanbul and now finds himself frozen out of first-team plans after being taken off at half-time in his most recent outing against Konyaspor. A brief statement from Fener released on the club‚Äôs official website read: ‚ÄúFootball A Team players Mesut Ozil and Ozan Tufan have been excluded from the squad as per the decisions taken.‚Äù Mesut Ozil has been excluded from Fenerbahce's latest squad üòî pic.twitter.com/4L6yP7YGJ3 After coming in for plenty of criticism towards the end of his spell in England, Ozil had been hoping to make a fresh start in Turkey. Questions were always going to be asked of his contribution, though, while working on a big contract and he has failed to live up to expectations. He registered just one assist and no goals through his opening 11 appearances for Fener and has sat out several weeks through injury in the current campaign. His output has improved, with the target found on eight occasions in the Super Lig this season, but he has not been as inspirational as everybody concerned with a high-profile deal had hoped. A back problem picked up in January forced him to miss seven games in all competitions before returning to action in early March. He was then hauled off at the interval during a 2-1 victory over Konyaspor, with that outing coming on the back of reports that Fener had to refute regarding Ozil‚Äôs regular absences. They said in response to claims that the 33-year-old was refusing to play due to payments not arriving on time: ‚ÄúThe news that Mesut Ozil did not play because his debts from the club were not paid have nothing to do with the facts. ‚ÄúAs we have often experienced, this kind of fake news that is created completely haphazardly without being confirmed by any official from our club is beyond our tolerance limit. ‚ÄúDespite the heavy economic conditions at Fenerbahce, payments have been made on time until now.‚Äù There have since been reports in Spain, where Ozil has previously turned out for Real Madrid, suggesting that a man who earned 92 caps for Germany before heading into international retirement is ready to look for a new club in the summer transfer window. It remains to be seen how many more competitive outings he will take in before then, with Fenerbahce taking the decision to announce his removal from their ranks despite Ismail Kartal‚Äôs side taking in a break from action until April 2.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ozil-left-out-fenerbahce-squad-unhappy-spell-turkey-ex/blt9e13cf8257ee330c,Chris Burton,b22950b2-763e-4105-9465-ffb69d7c9f7b
Mourinho hit with two-game ban after Roma manager sent off following latest outburst,"Jose Mourinho has been handed a two-game ban following an outburst that saw him sent off in Roma's draw against Hellas Verona.  Mourinho was sent off in injury time as the manager was seen shouting at the referee before booting a ball high into the air. Mourinho, who had to be restrained by an assistant, allegedly accused the referee of being sent by Juventus as the Portuguese boss continues to battle with Italian officials. According to La Stampa, Mourinho yelled towards referee Luca Pairetto: ""They sent you on purpose, Juve sent you..."" Pairetto, who has refereed 92 games in Serie A and was promoted to international referee this past September, has a brother that has worked for Juventus for eight years. Having only returned to Serie A this season, Mourinho has already had a number of disciplinary issues since taking over at Roma. The former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham boss was sent off earlier this season against Napoli after being booked twice.  In addition, he was even dismissed ahead of a friendly defeat to Real Betis, earning his marching orders before the game even began for trying to confront the referee on the pitch. As a result of this ban, Mourinho will miss matches against Spezia and Atalanta.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-hit-with-two-game-ban-after-latest-outburst/blt616193389e74cffa,Ryan Tolmich,64de1686-8eae-4299-947e-f1078701aa37
Messi told PSG stars he was signing new Barcelona contract as Paredes reveals shock at transfer U-turn,"Leandro Paredes has revealed his shock over Lionel Messi's transfer U-turn, claiming that his Argentina team-mate told Paris Saint-Germain stars that he was signing a new Barcelona contract before his surprise exit last summer. Messi's trophy-laden 17-year stay at Camp Nou came to an end in August 2021 as Barca announced that they would be unable to tie him down to a contract extension due to their financial troubles. PSG then moved to bring in the forward on a free transfer, and Paredes has now opened up on how quickly the situation changed as his compatriot had initially intended to commit to fresh terms in Catalunya. Several PSG players, including Paredes, were pictured with Messi in Ibiza before his departure from Barca was confirmed, which sent rumours of a potential move to Parc des Princes into overdrive. Paredes has confirmed that they tried to convince the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner to join them in Paris, but he had his heart set on remaining at Camp Nou to begin with. ""We had seen him in Ibiza the day before, and he was leaving the next day to sign with his club (Bar√ßa), that was all,"" the PSG midfielder told TyC Sports. ""We still told him: 'come with us' but he told us: 'I've already arranged everything, tomorrow I'm travelling to sign.'  ""Then I don't know what happened on that trip to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãbecause the very night he was going to sign the contract, he told us he was coming here."" Paredes added: ""At first, we obviously didn't believe him.  ""When he told me that he had already arranged everything and that he was going to Paris to sign the contract, I said to him: 'Until you sign and I see you wearing the Paris Saint-Germain shirt, I won't believe you'.""¬† Messi has struggled to live up to lofty expectations during his first season at PSG, recording just nine goals in 32 appearances in all competitions. The 34-year-old has also provided 13 assists to help the club regain the Ligue 1 title, but he was targeted with boos by supporters following the club's disappointing round of 16 Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid. Paredes was disgusted by the reaction of the PSG faithful towards Messi, who he insists does not deserve any of the criticism he's received over the past few months. ""When they whistled him, I couldn't believe it, these are things we can't handle but it was really crazy,"" he said.  ""You suffer because knowing what Leo is, what he generates and what he gives you, what he tries to do for the club, the way the truth is presented is boring.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-told-psg-new-barcelona-contract-paredes-transfer-u/blt0a584d2ab5a3a421,James Westwood,d4605cfb-9233-4106-acf3-2799dab49738
Iwobi‚Äôs work rate was brilliant for Everton despite costly blunder against West Ham - Lampard,"Everton manager Frank Lampard has come out to defend the performance of Alex Iwobi after his costly mistake allowed West Ham to register a 2-1 Premier League win on Sunday. After Aaron Cresswell put the Hammers ahead at London Stadium, the Toffees drew level courtesy of Mason Holgate in the second half. However, it was the former Arsenal player who gave away the winning goal. The 25-year-old Super Eagle lost concentration and could not collect Michael Keane‚Äôs pass, allowing West Ham‚Äôs Pablo Fornals to put Michail Antonio through on goal, and his one-time effort was saved by Jordan Pickford but Jarrod Bowen reacted to smash home the rebound. Lampard has now refused to blame Iwobi for his mistake and instead, praised him for his versatility. ‚ÄúAlex [Iwobi] played really well and I hope people don't focus too much on the negative and the mistake because if you focus on that you have to remind yourself that he scored us the winning goal against Newcastle in our last game,‚Äù Lampard told reporters as quoted by allnigeriasoccer.com. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got attributes to be able to play in different positions. I thought his work rate was brilliant, his play against a very strong midfield West Ham, he gave us a lot by coming into midfield and I thought he did well.‚Äù Meanwhile, Lampard believes the outcome of the game did not reflect the fighting spirit put up by his charges. ‚ÄúWe deserved more, at 1-1 I fancied us to be the stronger team and push to score the second,‚Äù Lampard said as quoted by Everton's official website.  ‚ÄúThere were so many positives, in terms of how we approached the game against a good team. We certainly deserved a point. ‚ÄúEverything is going against us: decisions, moments in games, red cards. I can‚Äôt fault the players‚Äô character or their play. There were mistakes, maybe, but West Ham made mistakes, too, and it didn‚Äôt fall our way. ‚ÄúThe performance was really positive and we have 10 more games to perform like that. We kept going and had a couple of half-chances and the spirit and resilience of the team was really good.‚Äù Iwobi and Everton will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to face Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday before the visit of Manchester United at Goodison Park on Saturday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/iwobi-brilliant-everton-costly-blunder-west-ham-lampard/blt03158f32f8cbe6c8,Dennis Mabuka,af2a476a-6499-4012-a577-20d2c888b568
Ederson reacts to viral image of Man City goalkeeper crouching down close to halfway line during Manchester derby & explains why he did it ,"Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson generated some surprising headlines on the back of a derby win over Manchester United, as he was pictured crouching down on halfway as the Red Devils struggled to get anything going at the Etihad Stadium, but the Brazilian insists his actions were ‚Äúperfectly normal‚Äù. Ederson has always been a sweeper keeper for the Premier League champions and is widely heralded as one of the finest number ones around when it comes to dealing with balls in the air and on the deck. With that in mind, he is not averse to roaming well outside of his penalty area, as he did against United, and insists that too much is being read into him supposedly disrespecting local rivals by highlighting just how toothless they became in the second half of a 4-1 defeat. Ederson told reporters when asked if City needed a keeper against United: ‚ÄúI've seen that image after the game. I've been in that position various times, whether it is a corner or throw-in I always look to play high up to shut down a counter by the opponents. ‚ÄúIt's something that I do a lot in games and sometimes people don't really notice. As it was a derby more people noticed. ‚ÄúThat's the way I play, Pep asks me to play high up and there are a lot of games where you play more with your feet than your hands but you need to be prepared for everything. ‚ÄúSometimes it could be a counter for our team as well if there is a better passing option. It's perfectly normal and something we've been doing very well.‚Äù With City becoming a dominant force in domestic and continental football, Ederson has many outings in which he has little to do. He has grown accustomed to that and claims to have mastered the art of keeping his concentration when it would be easy to let his thoughts wander. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to concentrate in games when I don't see much of the ball but I always look to be constantly communicating with my team-mates,‚Äù Ederson added. ‚ÄúA lot of the time I talk to my team-mates after the game that I'm tired. A game where I don't make many saves I'm tired mentally because the mental tiredness is more tiring than the physical tiredness. ‚ÄúConcentrating for 90 minutes is difficult, I do it better these days due to my communication with the rest of the team.‚Äù City will be hoping to enjoy another quiet evening on Wednesday when they take in the second leg of a Champions League last-16 encounter with Sporting that they currently lead 5-0 on aggregate.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ederson-reacts-viral-image-man-city-goalkeeper-kneeling/blt5dae1ac1efde52dd,Chris Burton,f9ff28fa-dc0b-482b-ae6d-2e5faf3aa9a8
Sterling inspires 10-man Chelsea to win over Leicester as Blues overcome Gallagher letdown,"WHAT HAPPENED? Conor Gallagher saw red midway through the first half, putting Chelsea on the back foot.

Brilliant Brentford humiliate Man Utd with 4-0 demolition,"WHAT HAPPENED?

Mohamed Salah‚Äôs history at the World Cup: Play-off heartache & injury pain for Egypt talisman,"Mohamed Salah‚Äôs performances at club level with Liverpool have allowed him to cement a standing among the global elite, but the Egypt international is yet to make a telling contribution for his country on a World Cup stage. That is not entirely his own fault, with sporting fate often conspiring against a man who would like nothing more than to showcase his undoubted ability to the full at the biggest footballing event on the planet. What does his record at that level look like and what has gone wrong for a forward that is clinging to the hope that there will be better days to come for him when rubbing shoulders with the best in the business? GOAL casts an eye over Salah‚Äôs exploits to date. Salah was a matter of days away from completing a move to European football at Swiss side FC Basel when he made his first telling contribution in a World Cup fixture. That outing came on June 10, 2012 when he netted a stoppage-time winner for Egypt in an important qualification clash with Guinea. Almost a year later, on June 9, 2013, Salah hit a hat-trick in a 4-2 victory over Zimbabwe, before registering another decisive effort in a narrow victory over Zimbabwe a week later. In total, he found the target on six occasions in qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, with that return enough to make him the joint-top goalscorer in the CAF section. Salah‚Äôs efforts were, however, ultimately in vain as Egypt came unstuck against Ghana at the play-off stage. A crushing 6-1 first-leg defeat left the Pharaohs with a mountain to climb and, despite prevailing 2-1 on home soil in a return date of that contest, collective dreams were dashed. The race to be fit in time for the World Cup starts now for @MoSalah. üá™üá¨(Cartoon by @omomani) pic.twitter.com/VOLoxjgg18 Salah was a Premier League superstar at Liverpool by the time the business end of a qualification quest was reached for the 2018 World Cup, with the third and final round of that process getting under way in October 2016. Egypt‚Äôs talisman once again topped the goalscoring charts across six games, with the target found on five occasions. Only two other players hit the net for the Pharaohs when collecting 13 points from a possible 18, with Salah‚Äôs most important contribution coming in a 2-1 victory over Congo ‚Äì with his stoppage-time penalty sending Egypt to their first World Cup finals since 1990. He was expected to thrive on a global stage in Russia, but an infamous challenge from Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos during the Champions League final of 2018 meant that an in-form performer was far from being in peak condition when a major tournament rolled around. Salah was able to recover from a shoulder injury in time to figure for his country, and found the target on two occasions after sitting out an opening group-stage encounter, but Egypt bowed out with no points to their name and a serious sense of what could have been. Mohamed Salah is the third different player to score for Egypt at the World Cup, after Abdelrahman Fawzi (1934) and Magdy Abed El Ghani (1990)  #RUSEGY pic.twitter.com/VYxaOzY5HY Rather surprisingly, given his previous qualification exploits and remarkable standards being set at club level, Salah did not register a single goal for Egypt during the second round of qualifying for the 2022 finals. He did, however, help to secure top spot in the Pharaohs‚Äô group and a place in the play-offs.

Watch: USMNT keeper Steffen makes huge error to gift Mane goal in Man City vs Liverpool FA Cup semi-final,"Manchester City goalkeeper Zack Steffen made an almighty error to hand Liverpool their second goal of the game after the USMNT international dawdled too long to allow Sadio Mane a close-range finish in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. Steffen, a regular starter over Ederson in domestic cup action this term, had already conceded once in north London after Ibrahima Konate headed in the opener for the Reds. But Steffen's decision to pause too long on the ball inside his own area proved to be his undoing for the follow-up, after Mane lunged onto his belated clearance at close range and diverted the ball past him into the back of the net.

Crisis averted: Chelsea boss Tuchel masterfully managed Lukaku controversy,"Thomas Tuchel has masterfully guided Chelsea out of the storm created by Romelu Lukaku's unsanctioned Sky Sport Italia interview. After bravely dropping the Belgian for Sunday's Premier League clash with Liverpool, and seeing his players respond with a spirited showing in a dramatic 2-2 draw, the German manager held talks with Lukaku that ended with the striker making a public apology for his untimely criticism. On Wednesday night, Tuchel recalled the former Inter striker to his starting line-up for what proved another show of strength from the Blues boss, who masterminded a 2-0 victory over in-form Tottenham in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. Kai Havertz opened the scoring at Stamford Bridge with a close-range strike early on and Japhet Tanganga headed into Ben Davies to leave Spurs with a mountain to climb ahead of next Tuesday's return fixture in north London. While Antonio Conte was returning to Chelsea as an opposition manager for the first time since parting company with the Blues in 2018, the build-up to the tie unsurprisingly focused on Lukaku, both in terms of how he would respond to the controversy caused by his interview, and whether the fans would be quick to forgive his actions. Tuchel, for his part, had called on the fans to stick with their No.9 and fully support the team. As it transpired, the supporters neither cheered nor booed Lukaku's name when the teams were read out just before kick-off and, in truth, he wasn't a protagonist in a game that Chelsea dominated. Of all the players to complete 90 minutes, he had the fewest touches and wasted a host of chances to shoot or play a decisive final ball. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham.Thomas Tuchel blocks out the noise üëâüòëüëà pic.twitter.com/WjLyvsQskK He flashed a decent header wide in the first half, before squandering an excellent opening late on when he shot directly at Hugo Lloris. In short, Lukaku was one of the main reasons why Chelsea didn't win by a bigger margin. Tuchel's pivot to a 4-4-2 for the first time since taking over last year took Conte by surprise but it was entirely enforced. Both N'Golo Kante and Thiago Silva tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of kick-off and with Andreas Christensen, Reece James, Trevoh Chalobah and Ben Chilwell having already been ruled out, Tuchel simply had to play with one less central defender than usual. ""Thiago and N'Golo were both supposed to start,"" the former Paris Saint-Germain coach explained in his post match press conference. ""We decided yesterday (Tuesday) at the last minute to switch to a back four and the guys were very committed and focused in order to play how we played. ""It was good and it is not always fair to demand performances out of nothing, like from Hakim [Ziyech], Saul and Malang [Sarr]. ""All three were outstanding today. It makes us very happy because it was a well-deserved win against a strong opponent."" It was certainly an impressive performance.  Because of the new system, Chelsea were entering unknown territory under Tuchel but, just as they had against Liverpool, the players responded admirably to adversity, showing that they can add another formation to their repertoire. It was a near-perfect display from the hosts, with only their finishing letting them down, and for Tuchel, it offered further validation of his tactical acumen, not to mention his man-management. After a poor run of results, followed by the Lukaku interview, Chelsea and their manager could easily have been overwhelmed by another crisis. Conte and many other former Chelsea managers have previously lost their jobs during times of acrimony and intense pressure. Tuchel, though, has handled a tricky situation masterfully, inspiring two positive performances against two top teams. He has learned that he has the full support of his employers, with both Petr Cech and Marina Granovskaia backing his handling of Lukaku. All is calm at Chelsea again üëç pic.twitter.com/JhuM0Q3ipS It's now been made clear that the Belgium international now only has one option available to him: get his head down and train hard. Lukaku has accepted that he has created this mess himself and is now determined to win back the trust of the fans. Seeing that, Tuchel wisely decided against making more out of the episode than was necessary. He may have exerted his authority but it was telling that he was quick to praise Lukaku after the game for his industry and endeavour. ""He was strong, involved, strong and showed huge commitment in our defensive work, which was important,"" Tuchel told reporters. ""He was always dangerous and used his body well. He was always involved in dangerous situations. ""I expected it honestly because Romelu can handle pressure and adversity. He seemed to be relaxed after the decision was made, after we finished our talks, and after he finished his talks.  ""The decision was made and I felt he was relaxed enough to turn in a performance like this."" Tuchel can forgive a couple of poor performances from a player. But he expects nothing less than 100 per cent in terms of effort and professionalism.  Lukaku has now learned that the hard way. But he and Chelsea could be all the better for it. Tuchel hasn't just restored order at Stamford Bridge. He's also got his team's season back on track.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/crisis-averted-chelsea-boss-tuchel-masterfully-managed/blta4e65bab2c6ad5b5,Nizaar Kinsella,c1cd1969-9485-4922-8d0d-5850c8185cdb
Salah: I don't know why I'm not allowed to say Liverpool prefer to play Real Madrid in the final,"Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has responded to criticism about his desire to play Real Madrid in the Champions League final. Many pundits, such as Gabby Agbonlahor, felt as if Salah's comments will give the Spanish team extra motivation and place pressure on the Egyptian's shoulders. The Reds sealed their place in the final after a 5-2 aggregate win over Villarreal on Tuesday evening, with Los Blancos claiming a 6-5 overall win over the Citizens on Wednesday, to qualify for the final to be held in Paris on May 28. Despite conceding Real Madrid are an unbelievable team with a great coach and players, the Pharaohs captain says all Liverpool players wanted to face the Spanish heavyweights rather than their English rivals. ""If you ask everybody [at Liverpool ], everyone wanted that game. I don't know why we're not allowed to talk about it but I'm ok to talk about it - I wanted that game! I wanted to play Real Madrid before that game [against Manchester City],"" Salah told Sky Sports. ""Of course, I'm not giving too much credit to them. They're an unbelievable team with a great coach and great players. When they asked me who I wanted, I said Madrid. It's an easy answer."" The May 28 showdown is a reminder of the 2018 final where the same teams played each other and Real Madrid claimed a 3-1 win. In that particular encounter, Salah went off early after a controversial challenge by Sergio Ramos. Meanwhile, the attacker has appreciated all who made it possible for him to be crowned the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year. The Egypt international has scored 30 goals and provided 15 assists in the 46 matches played across all competitions this term. ""It feels great; first of all, I want to thank everybody who voted for me. Of course, journalists are a big part of the football family. Hopefully, we can win some more this season,"" Salah said as quoted by the club's official site. ""I just try to enjoy my football and enjoy my time at the club, help the team to win trophies ‚Äì that‚Äôs the most important thing."" The team is in the Uefa Champions League final, the FA Cup final and has already won the League Cup, and is in the race to win the Premier League. ""We have been together for five years now, most of us ‚Äì some players more than five years. We know what it takes to win,"" Salah added. ""We just try to give our 100 percent. We need to focus on each game. You could see that also in the last game, we were 2-0 down in an away game and we managed to come back. That‚Äôs really important, for our mindset as well for the next game.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/salah-i-don-t-know-why-i-m-not-allowed-to-say-liverpool/bltc9f3b1c1a5359e6f,Seth Willis,b47b0ab4-aec5-4cb9-8619-a21c64b53061
England to face USWNT at Wembley after Women's Euro triumph,"European champions England will face the world champions, the U.S. women‚Äôs national team, at Wembley on October 7. The Lionesses triumphed at the national stadium on Sunday evening to win the 2022 Women‚Äôs Euros, beating Germany 2-1 in extra-time. Now, they can look ahead to taking on another powerhouse of the game ‚Äì the team that knocked them out in the semi-finals of the 2019 Women‚Äôs World Cup and has won the last two editions of the competition. The fixture is subject to England securing their place at the 2023 World Cup, but they only need a point from their final two qualifiers in September to do that and have won all eight of their games in the group so far. Speaking upon the announcement of this high-profile friendly, England head coach Sarina Wiegman said: ‚ÄúIt is really exciting to have the chance to play the U.S. at Wembley if we can make sure of qualification for the World Cup. ‚ÄúIt would be the perfect game for our squad to meet another strong team after so many tough games in the Euros. It is good we enjoy the moment we are in after this wonderful summer, but we know we still have to work to do to take the next step forward. ‚ÄúAs a team, we take nothing for granted with our goal of reaching the World Cup and whoever we play at home in October, it will be special to have another Wembley fixture. ""After the positive experiences we have had this summer, it will be great to welcome as many fans as possible so that we can say thanks again for their incredible support.‚Äù Speaking on Monday at England‚Äôs victory party at Trafalgar Square, defender Lucy Bronze was already talking about her desire to secure that World Cup trophy next summer, and his fixture with the U.S. would serve as excellent preparation in that goal. ‚ÄúThat will make [my trophy cabinet] full,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve had a winning mindset for a couple of years now. We‚Äôve been pushing that and just needed to match it on the field and we‚Äôve finally done that. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to be able to back up what we‚Äôve been saying, that we‚Äôre good enough to win things, good enough to win tournaments and make finals. We‚Äôve finally done that and we want to continue to do that. ""For a lot of the girls, that was their first tournament for England, and I think they think this is normal. That‚Äôs a great thing if they think that‚Äôs normal, then we have to keep getting to finals, that sets the standard.‚Äù Through the Football Association‚Äôs website, tickets for the game went on sale to My England Football members on August 2, with general sale beginning on August 3 at 2pm BST (6am PT/ 9am ET). Should England fail to secure World Cup qualification, and instead be involved in the play-offs in October, anyone with a ticket for the game would be entitled to a refund. The FA and U.S. Soccer would then work together to arrange a new date for the two sides to meet in the future.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-uswnt-wembley-womens-euro-triumph/blt0ab6f1cf9be9df25,Ame√© Ruszkai,30619d32-8e79-4352-86d1-490c7d864573
'It's maybe impossible' - Chelsea boss Tuchel struggles to see how to close gap to Man City and Liverpool,"Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel says it may be ""impossible"" for his side to close the gap on Manchester City and Liverpool, as the latter two teams fight it out for the Premier League crown this coming week. The Blues return to top-flight action after losing to the latter in the FA Cup Final, with penalty shootout heartbreak against Jurgen Klopp's Reds ensuing for the second time this season after the same result in the Carabao Cup Final earlier this year. With the final few games of the season still to be played, Chelsea could theoretically finish as far off the summit as 23 points away behind thier theoretical rivals though - and even without the uncertainty of a sanctioned transfer window that will see their squad shrink, Tuchel is unsure if the gap can be closed. ""It‚Äôs maybe impossible, I have to say, maybe impossible,"" the German was quoted by The Mirror when asked if his side could catch City and Liverpool in future seasons. ""They are improving their squad in every transfer window they have [while] it seems like we are losing key players. ""We are losing, of course, Toni [Rudiger], we‚Äôre losing Andreas [Christensen]. So this is tough and we already have [trouble keeping the] gap close."" Elsewhere, the German rallied in support of Mason Mount - whose decisive penalty shootout miss set up Liverpool's victory at Wembley on Saturday - and pointed to the pitfalls of social media in allowing such pressure to increase ‚ÄúNothing I can say will stop these guys doing it,"" he added. ""I don‚Äôt understand social media anyway. It has a huge impact and I don‚Äôt get it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on social media and it keeps me healthy, more healthy than I would be on it.

Shelvey: Newcastle will be as big as PSG and Manchester City,"Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey says they will soon become a ‚Äúmassive club"" on par with Manchester City and PSG following the club's big-money takeover. A Saudi Arabian-led consortium bought the club from Mike Ashley in October and promised to transform the Magpies into a side capable of competing with the Premier League and European elite. The appointment of Eddie Howe as manager and significant investment in players in January has already helped steer the club away from the relegation zone, but Shelvey says this is only the beginning. Shelvey is full of praise for the impact Howe has had since replacing Steve Bruce, with the former Bournemouth boss helping foster a strong team spirit. ‚ÄúI love life here, Newcastle is a great place to live. I usually only do three years then move on, but I‚Äôm settled,‚Äù he told Sky Sports. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not sugar coat it, we needed to be taken over. Everyone at the club is pulling in the one direction - the camaraderie around the place is something I‚Äôve not seen before. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had a manager like this before. The first thing he did was hand everyone a sheet of paper to write down their wives' and kids' names, plus all our birthdays. He wants to know everything about everyone. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm his cup of tea and want to do everything to repay him. ""At some clubs you get the hump if you‚Äôre not playing. Players can toss training off at times, but at Newcastle the ones not playing are in training the next day while the others recover - they‚Äôre probably fitter than those who have played the previous day.‚Äù Asked about the club‚Äôs ambitions, the former Swansea and Liverpool midfielder said there was no limit to what they could achieve. ‚ÄúThis club will be massive. I‚Äôm talking PSG and Man City massive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take time, and it‚Äôs a building process, but Newcastle can go to the top. We just all need to be patient. All I want is to be a part of the process.‚Äù Shelvey has also expressed his determination to impress Howe enough to earn a new contract at St James‚Äô Park and play his part in the club's transformation. The 30-year-old, who joined Newcastle from Swansea in 2016, will enter the final 12 months of his contract next season. ‚ÄúI want to show the club that I warrant a couple more years,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd happily hold my hands up and say I don‚Äôt deserve to be here if I felt I can‚Äôt play at this top level any more, but I want to stay as long as I can and be part of it all.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/shelvey-newcastle-psg-manchester-city/bltc297811d55e76c61,Tom Mallows,5c36d1ac-37fc-4e12-b4d1-25d0ddf9f144
"'Epic bout!' - Liverpool's intense draw with Man City like a classic boxing match, says Klopp","Manchester City preserved their status as Premier League title frontrunners despite being held to a 2-2 draw by Liverpool in an enthralling encounter at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. The Citizens seized the lead twice, through Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus, with Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane netting the response for the Reds. Raheem Sterling looked to have put the hosts back on top after the hour mark, only for his finish to be ruled out through VAR, but with the shares spoiled, it is Pep Guardiola's side who keep their noses in front of Jurgen Klopp's team at the summit. ""It was like a boxing fight, an epic bout,"" Klopp told NBC. ""If you put out your arms for a second, then you get a message knock, and that's what happened to both teams. ""I really think we're a step further than we were a year or so ago in possession. That's what we have to do in these games. It's really difficult because they defend really well, but it's possible to give them struggles, and that's what we did.

‚ÄòSomething died inside me‚Äô - Lewandowski reiterates transfer wish & warns Bayern Munich against blocking his path,"Robert Lewandowski has reiterated his desire to leave Bayern Munich in the summer transfer window, with the Poland international striker ‚Äì who has seen a move to Barcelona speculated on ‚Äì claiming that ‚Äúsomething died inside‚Äù him when talk of fresh terms being tabled in Germany began to drag on. The 33-year-old frontman enjoyed another remarkable campaign in 2021-22, registering 50 goals across all competitions, and the two-time FIFA Best award winner has now plundered at least 40 efforts across each of the last seven seasons. With the prolific Pole showing no sign of slowing down, Bayern would have been expected to do all they can to keep him on their books, but Lewandowski has suggested that was not the case and he is now looking to take on a new challenge away from the Allianz Arena. One of the greatest goalscorers of the modern era has told OnetSport of his future intentions and why he feels the need to sever ties with Bayern after eight years: ‚ÄúI am leaving because I want more emotions in my life. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want to listen to me until the end. Something died inside me, and it‚Äôs impossible to get over that. Even if you want to be professional, you can‚Äôt make up for it. ‚ÄúWhen you have been at the club for so many years, you were always ready, you were available, despite the injuries and pain you gave your best, I think it will be best to find a good solution for both sides. And not to look for a one-sided decision. ‚ÄúThat does not make sense. Not after this time.

"'Head up, I'll be back stronger' - How Liverpool gem Elliott overcame his horror injury","For once, Jurgen Klopp was struggling to find the right words. It was a warm September day at the AXA Training Centre, and the Liverpool boss had a pep talk to give. An important one. What do you say to a young footballer whose world has just caved in, whose leg is in a plaster cast and whose pain and misfortune has been televised live in 100 countries? Even Klopp, emotionally intelligent and as good a communicator as there is, found that one tough. He needn‚Äôt have worried. Because if there‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve learned about Harvey Elliott by now, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôll take more than injury to break this young man's spirit. ‚ÄúWhen I saw him I was in a worse mood than he was, to be honest,‚Äù Klopp says of that Kirkby encounter. ‚ÄúBut Harvey was like ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, head up, I‚Äôll be back stronger‚Äô and this kind of thing. ‚ÄúFrom the very first second, he was in a better place than the rest of us. He‚Äôs a really special kid.‚Äù That much was clear on Sunday, of course, as Elliott made a dream return to Reds action. After just under five months on the sidelines following that fracture dislocation of his left ankle at Leeds, the 18-year-old needed just 19 minutes to re-announce himself, scoring his first Liverpool goal in front of the Kop as Klopp‚Äôs side beat Cardiff 3-1 in the FA Cup fourth round. ‚ÄúA proper fairytale,‚Äù his manager called it. In the stands, Elliott‚Äôs father, Scott, was filmed in tears, the joy and the emotion pouring out. He‚Äôs a lifelong Liverpool fan, and to witness his son do that, after everything he‚Äôs been through, must have been some feeling. Speaking post-match, Elliott made sure he paid tribute to Liverpool‚Äôs medical team, and in particular Joe Lewis, the rehabilitation physio whose support and expertise has been key in getting him back on the pitch, on track and bang on schedule.¬† ""He took me under his wing,"" Elliott said. It was Mohamed Salah who got to Elliott first after the injury at Leeds, the Egyptian beckoning frantically to the bench as the youngster lay in agony with the game going on around him. Chris Morgan, the first-team physio, and Jim Moxon, the club doctor, were the ones who attended to him. It was Moxon who put the youngster‚Äôs ankle back in place within 30 seconds of the incident. By the time the final whistle had blown at Elland Road, Elliott was at Leeds General Infirmary awaiting treatment. There, he encountered a 13-year-old boy, Jacob, who had broken his arm playing for Leeds JFC Pumas. They chatted, and Jacob eventually left with Elliott‚Äôs No.67 jersey, his right boot and new hero to worship. A few days later, Elliott underwent surgery in London, an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), to repair the fracture and the damaged ligaments in the left ankle. ‚ÄúHis comeback starts now,‚Äù said Moxon in an update issued by the club, although he was quick to add that ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt put pressure on him by setting a specific timeframe beyond being able to say with confidence we expect him to feature again later in the season.‚Äù Internally, the target was always for a January return to training and a February return to action. The damage was significant, and made for some pretty gruesome pictures, but Elliott was back working in the gym at Kirkby within three weeks, and back jogging inside 10. ‚ÄúProbably, his biggest talent is how ready he is mentally,‚Äù said Klopp on Sunday, and that was evident as he, in the words of one staff member, ‚Äúattacked his recovery‚Äù ‚Äì always listening, always willing to work, and rarely, if ever, allowing his mood to dip. His attitude stood out a mile. Team-mates who had undergone long rehabilitation programmes themselves, such as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk, were staggered by his positivity. The senior players supported him, sending messages and making sure he was kept involved and engaged in any group chat or activity. Elliott was there, wearing a protective boot, at Liverpool‚Äôs official team photograph at Kirkby, and made it clear that he was desperate to attend as many Anfield matches as possible. ‚ÄúA lot of players don‚Äôt want to do that as it reminds them what they‚Äôre missing out on,‚Äù says one source close to the club. ‚ÄúHarvey, he was different. He never complained once, and he loved being around it all.‚Äù It helped, undoubtedly, that progress was both smooth and rapid. Elliott worked hard with Dr David Rydings, Liverpool‚Äôs rehabilitation fitness coach, and by December he was pictured outside doing ball work at Kirkby. ‚ÄúBack with my best friend,‚Äù he posted on social media. A few weeks later he was cleared to return to team training. Klopp had watched some of his rehab sessions from the balcony outside his office and knew he was in good shape, but still he was nervous. How would he look? Would there be any fear, or a reaction from the ankle? How rusty would he be? He didn‚Äôt need to worry. Elliott looked like he always did; sharp, bright and full of quality. Like he‚Äôd never been away. ‚ÄúLet me say it like this; he didn‚Äôt lose his football brain!‚Äù said assistant manager Pep Lijnders, who said it would be ‚Äúa crime‚Äù not to play the teenager soon. ‚ÄúSome players never knock on the door, they run through it,‚Äù the Dutchman added. ‚ÄúHarvey is one of them.‚Äù Klopp resisted the temptation to throw Elliott straight back in, leaving him out of the squad for the trips to Arsenal and Crystal Palace last month. However, if you ever wanted an example of how highly Liverpool rate the player, the fact that they arranged a friendly, with the specific aim of giving him an hour‚Äôs run out, during the international break should do the trick. Elliott, in typical fashion, lit the game up, scoring once and assisting twice as Wrexham‚Äôs youth team were beaten 5-1. Afterwards, he again showed his class, gifting his boots to one of the opposing centre-backs, Ollie Hitchcox. Hitchcox is an Anfield season-ticket holder, and described Elliott‚Äôs performance that day as ""beyond a joke"". And then came Sunday. Just as he dreamt it. He first visited Anfield as a three-year-old, taken by his dad to a Champions League qualifier against Maccabi Haifa, and now here he was, receiving a standing ovation and, in front of the Kop, netting that first Reds goal. ""It was a moment I'll remember and a moment that I can learn from in the future,"" he said. ""I‚Äôll look back on it and think, 'If I can go through it at such a young age, I can go through anything.'"" He can say that again. We‚Äôve known for some time that Harvey Elliott is a special footballer, but we now know he has the courage and the character to go with it. After five months of graft, Liverpool‚Äôs gem is ready to sparkle again, brighter than ever.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-gem-elliott-overcame-horror-injury/blte41bc5246895edcf,Neil Jones,7c026be8-e1c2-4f61-9846-088e4e090f98
'There is one missing' - Ancelotti reveals special motivational video he showed Real Madrid stars to inspire Man City miracle,"Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has revealed that he prepared a special motivational video for his players ahead of their Champions League semi-final second leg clash against Manchester City. Ancelotti's Blancos went into the match at Santiago Bernabeu having to make up a goal deficit, with City having won the first leg 4-3 at the Etihad Stadium ‚Äì although missed chances meant the hosts could have won by a far bigger margin. As such, failure to be more clinical offered Madrid hope going into the second leg, and the Italian head coach added his own additional inspiration ahead of the crunch match-up.

The video ended with the message: 'There is one missing'. And we succeeded. ‚ÄúThe greatness of this club is that it never lets you down.

Bellingham fully committed to Borussia Dortmund amid Premier League transfer links,"Jude Bellingham has reaffirmed his commitment to Borrussia Dortmund for the near future, ruling out the possibility of following in the footsteps of fellow high-profile team-mates by making a move to the Premier League. Erling Haaland's switch to Manchester City was recently confirmed, while Three Lions team-mate Jadon Sancho moved to Manchester United last year, with the Red Devils also linked with Bellingham himself. But now he has poured cold water over suggestions he might look to walk out of the door and says he will stick with the club. ""The only future I think about is the next game for Dortmund,"" Bellingham told Ruhr Nachrichten. ""I'm really looking forward to next season. I can't wait for it to finally start. ""I'll be here next season and I'll be ready."" The GOAL NXGN 2022 star also paid tribute to the club's staff for tempering expectations, adding: ""I'm really grateful to Dortmund for the way they encouraged my talent. I think a lot of the credit goes to the coaching staff and staff who keep the hype around me down.‚Äù In remaining with Dortmund, the England star hopes that he can help the club finally break the monopoly on the Bundesliga that Bayern Munich have held for a decade. ""Breaking a ten-year streak would be incredible for Borussia Dortmund and for me personally, and that's why we're attacking again next season,"" he added. ""It would be one of the greatest achievements in Europe to beat the team that has been dominant for so long.

Tinkler: How ex-Orlando Pirates coach De Sa reacted to Queiroz‚Äôs call for Egypt job ,"Former Orlando Pirates coach Eric Tinkler has explained how Roger De Sa immediately packed his bags to travel to Cairo after Carlos Queiroz gave him a call inviting him to help him coach Egypt. Queiroz was appointed Pharaohs coach in September 2021 and roped in De Sa whom he had previously worked with in the Bafana Bafana set-up as goalkeepers and assistant coach. With De Sa off the spotlight in South African top-flight league football, leading a project on the lower tiers in recent years, Queiroz‚Äôs call appeared to have thrust him into the spotlight again.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fantastic to see our coaches doing well,‚Äù Tinkler told Times Live.  ‚ÄúRoger has always been a good friend with Queiroz. Their relationship dates back to when Queiroz coached Bafana [2001/02], and Roger was a goalkeeper in the team, and then became his assistant.   ‚ÄúQueiroz roped Roger in [as an assistant coach] for Portugal when he led them here at the 2010 World Cup. I think Roger‚Äôs coaching style has been based on what he‚Äôs learnt from Queiroz. ‚ÄúSo Roger becoming Queiroz‚Äôs Egypt assistant didn‚Äôt come as a surprise to me. I was with Roger when he got the news from Queiroz, and he had to pack a bag and leave in the space of two or three days.  ‚ÄúSo he didn‚Äôt have a lot of forewarning about the job. And I know it‚Äôs been a tough job because they got there and had qualification matches, then the Arab Cup, and then straight to the Afcon. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of pressure on them and they didn‚Äôt start very well, but slowly things started to get better. Now they‚Äôre in the semi-finals, and we know the quality that Egypt have, and we‚Äôre starting to see it again. A lot of that is to do with what Queiroz and Roger have managed to instil again.‚Äù After De Sa was crowned an African champion with Bafana Bafana in 1996 as a reserve goalkeeper, he has a chance to claim the continental title again, but this time around as an assistant coach. Egypt will face hosts Cameroon on Thursday. De Sa is not new in Egypt after he guided Orlando Pirates to the 2013 Caf Champions League final in which they faced Al Ahly. Interestingly, back then Tinker was his assistant coach.  ‚ÄúI think people in Egypt do remember when we were successful against their teams in the Champions League,‚Äù said Tinkler.   ‚ÄúRoger built a reputation in Africa because of what he achieved with Pirates in 2013, similar to me reaching the 2015 and 2017 Confederation Cup finals with Pirates and SuperSport United. ‚ÄúSA coaches doing well on the continent is the reason Pitso has got the job he has now with Ahly ‚Äî because of what he did with Sundowns in the Champions League.   ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs opened the door for people to look at SA coaches.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tinkler-how-ex-orlando-pirates-coach-de-sa-reacted-to/blt6e83032fc2999b15,Michael Madyira,a2d4a40e-b170-4093-a385-5752137506b3
Salah: Klopp insists Liverpool forward is experiencing a 'normal' spell ahead of Manchester United Premier League showdown,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has insisted there is no need for alarm over Mohamed Salah's drought in front of goal. The 29-year-old's last goal for the Reds came way back on March 12 in the 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion. He has since gone eight matches for club and country in all competitions without a goal, and in that period, he has managed a single assist that came in the last Premier League assignment against Manchester City that ended 2-2. On Tuesday, Salah is expected to feature as Liverpool host Manchester United in the English top-tier assignment at Anfield. When asked whether he is worried about his club's top scorer, Klopp insisted it is normal for the player to undergo such times. ""It is a completely normal spell [Salah] is going through,"" the German tactician said in a press conference ahead of the Tuesday night meeting with the Red Devils. ""We have spoken about all the physical demands he faced in the last few months so it is completely normal. I liked the game against City a lot, it was a really good football game, and it's only a question of time when he will score as well.  ""He was unlucky in a couple of moments and we all know if you don't have luck as a striker you don't even try. It was close enough now for a couple of times. The moment will definitely come. ""I am really happy with the performance he showed a few days ago."" The former Borussia Dortmund manager has further revealed his relationship with the player in training and the discussions between them. ""I see him more often in training than I see him in games and we play every three days,"" Klopp continued.  ""You have to look at it and then I have to make a decision if there is a need if we talk or not.  ""We had plenty of talks over the time we worked together but at this specific time, there is no need for it. We talk about the situation, we talk about the normal stuff about what he has to do in the game, the gameplan, and how to expose the opponent but it's completely individual to all players.""

Arsenal & Liverpool offered David transfer hope with admission from Canadian striker‚Äôs agent,"Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid and the many other suitors of Lille forward Jonathan David have been told that there is a deal to be done in 2022, with the Canada international‚Äôs agent revealing that a new challenge will be sought next summer. The highly-rated 22-year-old has been catching the eye of leading clubs across Europe with his exploits in the current campaign, which have him clear of Kylian Mbappe and Wissam Ben Yedder on the Ligue 1 top goalscorers chart. Those efforts are set to deliver a big-money transfer elsewhere, with his representative claiming that an exit is being planned in France despite David being tied to a contract through to 2025. Nick Mavromaras has told Radio Canada: ‚ÄúFor us, the goal is to finish the season in Lille, but it will be his last season there for several reasons. ‚ÄúI think the Premier League is a good option for him. I think that he likes Spain a lot also because he likes the feeling of the ball and the very technical players. ‚ÄúThese two leagues are a big priority for him, but nothing is excluded. You never know what could happen with Paris Saint -Germain or the big Italian clubs. ‚ÄúIt's normal that all these big clubs are interested in the top scorer in Ligue 1, but I can tell you that today there is no official offer.‚Äù No price tag has been put on an in-form frontman as yet, but his valuation continues to rise with each passing performance. David has hit 12 goals in the French top-flight this season, through 19 appearances, and is considered to occupy a similar talent bracket to in-demand Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland when it comes to hot prospects ‚Äì with the prolific Norwegian seeing a ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£85m/$113m) transfer speculated on. Quizzed on how much his client could go for, Mavromaras added: ‚ÄúI cannot say the price today. It has to do with Lille. ‚ÄúBut in the end, it's football. Jonathan is not going to say it, but he knows that he is one of the best young strikers in the world. ‚ÄúThere is also Erling Haaland, who costs today 75 to 100 million euros. There have been offers to 150 million euros. If you want to be on that list, you have to learn to handle the pressure.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-liverpool-david-transfer-hope-admission-canada/blt67c29d7f4d70916d,Chris Burton,92156ee8-b395-4019-b2e1-d7e61582d4f6

Liverpool‚Äôs Klopp delivers Salah injury news ahead of Wolverhampton Wanderers Premier League game,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has delivered the latest injury update on Mohamed Salah ahead of their Premier League season-ending action against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Salah and Virgil van Dijk picked up knocks during their FA Cup game against Chelsea and consequently missed their league match against Southampton. Roberto Fabinho, who suffered a muscle problem against Aston Villa, and Joe Gomez, who was forced off after a heavy blow during their match against Aston Villa, are the other players injured. ""But Mo [Salah] doesn‚Äôt want to take any risks, there is no doubt about that,"" Klopp told the club‚Äôs website. ""It looks good but the boys make steps and we will see. My preferred solution would be that they all could play at the weekend for rhythm reasons, stuff like this, or at least could be on the bench and then we can bring them on or not, but they are involved. ""But if not, then we take it from there. I cannot say 100 per cent."" On Gomez, Klopp was confident about his progress: ""Joe is first and foremost good news. ""Yesterday [Thursday] we had a reassuring further scan, but like we and he thought after the game, we were lucky. It was a proper knock but nothing happened.¬† ""It was the leg where he was injured, so I understand 100 percent that everybody was a bit concerned ‚Äì I was until I saw Joey‚Äôs face in the dressing room. I think most of the time, we know best about our body.¬† ""The result of this scan is not here yet but we don‚Äôt expect anything really different, it was just reassuring, it‚Äôs all fine and from there we go.

"'Real Madrid want to kill the Champions League, then they celebrate winning it for days!' - PSG chief Al-Khelaifi takes aim at Spanish giants","PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has launched an extraordinary attack on Real Madrid, accusing them of winning the Champions League mere months after ""they wanted to kill it"". Madrid earned their 14th European Cup title in 2022, beating Liverpool in the final in Paris - having also been at the forefront of the failed European Super League breakaway. PSG stayed away from the doomed ESL plans, and have long targeted Champions League glory only for their star-studded squad to consistently fail to deliver. In an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport, Al-Khelaifi said a closed shop European competition such as the Super League would be a disaster for football, and the ability of teams from outside the self-appointed elite to reach the latter stages of the Champions League was key. He said: ""I respect the big clubs. Real Madrid deserved the Champions League: they celebrated it for days and then they want to kill it. ""I like to see Ajax in the semi-finals, Tottenham in the final. I remember with emotion PSG's first outings in Europe, in Salzburg with the bare-chested fans freezing. ""It is the soul of football. It is unfair to deny it with a closed league. We will not let that happen."" Al-Khelaifi also took aim at Spanish league boss Tebas, who has been a long-standing critic of PSG and their Qatar-based wealth, which has allowed them to make huge money signings - like Neymar and Lionel Messi - and dominate Ligue 1. Tebas recently fumed at PSG renewing Kylian Mbappe's contract when he was on the verge of joining Madrid, calling it an ""insult to football"", before he publicly denounced both Paris and Manchester City for their perceived flouting of financial fair play rules. Al-Khelaifi has now hit back, saying: ""Tebas who? I do not give lessons to anyone or interfere with other clubs or leagues. ""It is rude to pretend to tell others what to do. I do not accept lessons from those who see the champions as a threat to their league. I have a project to build, respecting everyone.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-champions-league-psg-al-khelaifi/bltcf5d3921f523c2df,Emma Smith,101f7f29-58f3-4493-bfdd-ff6bc1e4c0e4

"Barcelona raise a further ‚Ç¨100m in race to register Lewandowski, Raphinha, Kessie, Kounde & Christensen","Barcelona have sold 24.5 per cent of Barca studios to Orpheus media and have raised ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£85m/$103m) in the process, which should go some way towards aiding their transfer activity in the ongoing summer window. The general assembly of FC Barcelona members authorised the deal during a meeting in October 2021. It is now gone through, with the Liga giants desperate to raise funds as they seek to get a number of big-money signings - such as Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde, Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie - registered in time for the start of their 2022-23 campaign. The official statement from the club read: ""FC Barcelona announces the sale of 24.5% of Barca Studios to the company Orpheus Media, managed by Mr. Jaume Roures, an audiovisual production company with a long history of producing content, for 100 million euros. The agreement complements the one signed on 29 July with Socios.com and will help to accelerate the growth of the club's digital, NFT and Web.3 strategy.  ""The sale was conducted under authorization of the General Assembly of FC Barcelona Members last October 23. With this investment, the strategic partners in Bar√ßa Studios show confidence in the value of the project and the future of digital content in the world of sport.""

Ex-Arsenal man Koscielny announces retirement and refutes allegations of racism,"Former Arsenal star Laurent Koscielny has officially announced his retirement from football and denied accusations that he exhibited racist behaviour. The French defender went back to his home nation after leaving England in 2019, featuring for Bordeaux in Ligue 1. At the age of 36, his retirement is not entirely shocking - but his statement and the manner of it caught many off guard. A statement reads: ""Following the article published in the Sud Ouest newspaper on March 22, 2022 entitled ‚ÄòGirondins de Bordeaux. Costil and Koscielny, accusations of racism that shake‚Äô, Laurent Koscielny was surprised, shocked but also saddened by the remarks made by one of the representatives of the Ultramarines 87 Group against him, which the press is now echoing.

"Bombs, rocks and pitch invasions: Brazilian football's shameful weekend ","While violent episodes among fans are far from unknown in Brazilian football, or indeed across South America, the attack suffered by Bahia prior to the club's Copa Nordeste clash with Sampaio Correa last week was shocking for its severity and potential for serious injury or even worse. The team bus was ambushed on its way to their Fonte Nova home and explosive devices were hurled at the vehicle a short distance from the stadium. Miraculously, the explosion, which left a gaping hole in the coach's side and blew out the windows of another car that happened to be passing by at the time of the assault, left the players and staff inside with just minor injuries, with goalkeeper Danilo Fernandes the only individual needing hospital attention for superficial cuts to his face caused by shattered glass. Veja o exato momento em que √¥nibus do Bahia √© atingido por uma bomba. LAMENTAMOS E REPUDIAMOS O OCORRIDO. pic.twitter.com/O1If7ZJiFH Incredibly, and minus the hospitalised Fernandes, Bahia were even able to take the field that same night, and took down Sampaio to keep their defence of the Copa Nordeste alive and well after a tough start to the season.  ‚ÄúDue to dignity, professionalism and to honour Bahia's colours,‚Äù coach Guto Ferreira signalled when asked why they played following the attack ‚Äì which, perhaps most troubling of all, was carried out by members of Bahia's very own organised 'Torcida' ultra group. Bahia's ordeal was one of four serious incidents that occurred in Brazil across the space of just three days. That same evening, Nautico's team bus was pelted by rocks by disgruntled fans as the club returned to Recife airport following their elimination from the Copa do Brasil, again smashing several windows on the vehicle. On Saturday, meanwhile, it was the Gremio coach that was targeted on its approach to Beira Rio in Porto Alegre ahead of the Tricolor's derby visit to Internacional. Paraguay international Mathias Villasanti suffered multiple injuries after being struck by a rock, including a concussion, and like Danilo was hospitalised; while on this occasion Gremio refused to play, slamming the attack as a ‚Äúcowardly and absurd aggression‚Äù and forcing postponement to March 9. If that were not enough, the same Saturday saw fans of Parana literally come to blows with players in the middle of the pitch as the Curitiba side faced relegation from the state championship top flight. Military riot police were forced into action to protect both sides and the officiating team from supporters wielding clubs and iron pipes, another nightmarish scene which thankfully did not end in tragedy. VERGONHA!!! Torcida do Paran√° Clube acaba de invadir o gramado da Vila Capanema e alguns at√© trocaram socos com os jogadores. pic.twitter.com/zzyf2FD28B Which one of these episodes, if any, will prompt those in charge ‚Äì and, no less importantly, those fans responsible for the incidents, ultras or otherwise ‚Äì to admit there is a problem and give players the protection they need and deserve? It is clear at least that players' patience is running thin. ‚ÄúEnough! How long are we going to have to put up with this,‚Äù Danilo Fernandes and Bahia team-mates Matheus Bahia and Marcelo Cirino asked in a scathing Instagram message highlighting the wave of violence. ""To more safety for us and the end of violence in football."" Former Chelsea and Arsenal star Willian, now with Corinthians, also lent his voice to the campaign. ‚ÄúNothing is happening here. [The Torcidas] will keep doing this, over and again,‚Äù he fired. ‚ÄúThe authorities tolerate this. I have learned one thing, that we cannot complain against the things that we tolerate. ‚ÄúI am here that we do have to show our indignation with the situation. We all have to join to combat violence in football.‚Äù More effective police protection of team vehicles and in the stands is an obvious first step that must be taken, but it is not a magic solution. Studies such as sociologist Mauricio Murad's Practices of fan violence and death in Brazilian football point the finger at a tiny minority of supporters: ‚Äúbetween 5 and 10 percent, in the organised groups. Minorities, but dangerous and concerning, because they are armed, trained and organised for violent confrontation.‚Äù Such groups, such as Bahia's Bamor ‚Äì accused of responsibility in the recent ambush - and the Mancha Alviverde of Palmeiras often wield huge power and pressure on their clubs. Even as Palmeiras lifted the Recopa Sudamericana on Wednesday, the Mancha held up banners and signs berating president Leila Pereira's administration and calling for the club chief ‚Äì the first female to hold that post in their history ‚Äì to step aside. The very next day communications head Oliverio Junior was forced to leave his role in a partial victory for the ultras. Just two weeks earlier, a 40-year-old Palmeiras fan was shot to death in a confused incident just outside the club's Allianz Parque home, where a crowd had gathered to watch the Verdao's Club World Cup final against Chelsea. The man accused of his murder claims he was set upon by members of the Mancha Alviverde and fired in self-defence. Palmeiras declined to release a statement over the fatality, and almost simultaneously the Mancha were honoured by the Abu Dhabi Sports Council for their ‚Äúoutstanding support‚Äù at the Club World Cup. Abu Dhabi Sports Council honored Mancha Alvi Verde for their outstanding support for Palmeiras at the #FIFA #ClubWC #UAE 2021 https://t.co/LYvqyedqoi As in neighbouring nations such as Argentina and Uruguay, the organised groups are often treated as cult heroes for their fervent, colourful and supposedly unconditional support, but behind the drums, chants and flares is a sinister sense of impunity and entitlement which allows them to act without consequence, knowing that few club officials have the power to stand up to them and remove them from the stands. It is that culture of looking the other way that permits attacks on one's own players in order to 'punish' a poor run of form to be tolerated in this fashion, but it cannot go on in this manner. If clubs do not take steps to rein in their own fans and make it clear that violence of any kind is unacceptable, the ambushes and invasions will continue to take place, otherwise it can only be a matter of time before a player is left seriously hurt or perhaps even worse for merely doing his job.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bombs-rocks-and-pitch-invasions-brazilian-football-s/blt1960e61651586fb2,Daniel Edwards,0b30abe8-de9f-4254-853d-082aed98b967
Tuchel and Conte both get red cards in thrilling Chelsea and Tottenham clash,"WHAT HAPPENED? Chelsea and Spurs played out a thriller at Stamford Bridge which ended with both managers seeing red. Tottenham fought back twice to ensure they leave with a point for their efforts. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Both sides remain undefeated after two games in the Premier League this season. The game was a good chance to assess how much progress has been made since they last faced in January 2022. ALL EYES ON: Kalidou Koulibaly managed to endure himself to the Chelsea faithful with a wonderful goal in the first-half. The defender took on the iconic No. 26 of former captain John Terry and certainly lived up to the billing with his strike. THE MATCH IN THREE PHOTOS: Koulibaly announced himself to the home crowd with a cracker in the first half A clash after Tottenham's equaliser saw both sets of coaching teams receive caution from the ref.  Tuchel and Conte clashed numerous times throughout the match, and it ended in them both seeing red. DID YOU KNOW? Tottenham have only won once at Stamford Bridge in 37 games. WHAT'S THE VIBE? Thomas Tuchel hasn't replaced Romelu Lukaku yet, but he may not feel he needs to as the front three he deployed ran riot in the first half. This is how Tuchel envisages football without a big number nine. Absolute what he wants with intense pressing being led by three nimble forwards. #CFC #CHETOT From friends to enemies...

Middlesbrough fans wear Ukrainian president Zelenskyy masks during FA Cup clash with Chelsea,"Middlesbrough supporters wearing masks of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were spotted by photographers during Chelsea's FA Cup visit on Saturday. The Blues made the trip to the Riverside Stadium to face their lower-league hosts amid a slate of sanctions against the club in connection with owner Roman Abramovich's relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Amid the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis, Boro fans were seen to have offered their support to the invaded nation. Supporters were spotted dotted around the Riverside Stadium sporting masks that featured the likeness of Zelenskyy, who has become a widely recognised figurehead amid the Russian invasion. It represented a particularly pointed rebuttal to the Blues and their alleged links with the Putin regime through Abramovich, despite the latter's attempts to sell the club before it was subsequently sanctioned as part of the UK government's move against him. Zelenskyy, a former comedian and actor who rose to become Ukraine's president, previously gained recognition for his role on the popular television series Servant of the People, where he played the nation's leader following an unexpected populist election. The masks were only part of the protest against the Blues, who came under fire for requesting their game against Middlesbrough to be played behind closed doors earlier this week. Though they subsequently withdrew the request, Chelsea found themselves roundly booed when they arrived at the Riverside Stadium ahead of kick-off on Saturday. The club travelled by bus, amid sanctions that prohibit the cost of travel ¬£20,000.

'We can't sleep after we lose' -  Xhaka wants to change 'bulls**t' opinions of Arsenal as 2022-23 season begins,"Granit Xhaka smiles when he‚Äôs reminded of the goal he scored for Arsenal against Manchester United in April. The 25-yard thunderbolt - which fans voted as goal of the season - sealed a pulsating 3-1 victory for the Gunners. The celebrations which followed felt like a big moment for Xhaka, who had seemed certain to leave the Gunners just a couple of years earlier following his high profile spat with the club‚Äôs fans after he was substituted by Unai Emery during a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace in October 2019. As Xhaka left the pitch to a chorus of boos from the Emirates crowd, the midfielder snapped - telling the Arsenal fans to ""f**k off"" before he made his way down the tunnel. There seemed no way back and Xhaka has since admitted that he had his suitcases packed and was set to leave for Germany, only for Mikel Arteta to convince him to stay following his appointment as Emery‚Äôs successor. Xhaka has been trying to rebuild his relationship with supporters ever since and that goal against Man Utd, which came at such a crucial point of the season, was the biggest bridge builder yet. Now - as the midfielder prepares to begin his seventh season with the Gunners - he is determined to continue rebuilding that bond. ‚ÄúThis was maybe one of my greatest moments inside this football club,‚Äù Xhaka says, as he recalls his strike. ‚ÄúEveryone knows what happened three years ago. To give you this answer now that [the goal] is one of the greatest moments, three years ago I would have said that it would never have happened.¬† ‚ÄúOf course I feel much more love from the fans. For my side as well trying to build something with them needs time for sure. But I have a feeling that we are in a good way.‚Äù Xhaka added: ‚ÄúA lot of people ask me ‚Äòwas last season the best Granit since you are here?‚Äô, but I never had problems in this club, not with teammates, not with people in the building, it was only this moment with the Palace game. Everything else was fine with the club.¬† ‚ÄúPeople only see this moment and they were disappointed and¬†forgot the other five years, but this is part of the business.‚Äù Xhaka has often felt misunderstood at Arsenal. He believes there is a feeling among English fans that players don‚Äôt really care about football, that they just shake themselves off after a defeat or a bad performance and carry on as normal. That‚Äôs a view he hopes might change after supporters watch Amazon‚Äôs All or Nothing documentary. The show provides an insight into what players go through behind the scenes, with the cameras even following Xhaka into his home where you see him with his wife and two children. The midfielder was happy to provide that sort of insight into his family life and would like to see fans given the opportunity to get even closer to players in the future as he believes it might change their opinion about how much players actually care. ""The people who do not see us in the training, for example, do not see how hard we are working,‚Äù he said. ""They see us only during the 90 minutes. ""Everyone has a good and bad day. That is why I spoke with the club [and asked] ‚Äòwhy can‚Äôt we bring the fans maybe once a week so they can see us how we train‚Äô?¬† ""It is not like we are coming here to waste our time and after we don‚Äôt care about the 90 minutes.¬† We care more than people think. We can‚Äôt sleep after the game when we lose. It does not matter if we are home or away. ‚ÄúNo one can see that. This makes me very disappointed and very sad that after that the people start to say,‚Äô you didn‚Äôt give everything for the club, you do that, you did‚Ä¶‚Äô This is bullsh*t.¬†¬† ‚ÄúIt is so difficult in England to bring the people to the training ground. In Germany it is different, you have two, three, four thousand people and they come every day.‚Äù At 29, Xhaka is one of the elder statesmen of the squad at Arsenal. While Mikel Arteta has cleared the decks since he arrived and moved on almost everyone who was at the club under either Arsene Wenger or Unai Emery, Xhaka has remained. He was close to leaving last summer, with Roma keen, but eventually stayed put and now he is set to play an influential role once again as Arsenal look to improve on last season‚Äôs fifth placed finish in the Premier League. ‚ÄúWith Rob Holding and Hector, I think I‚Äôm the only guy here from six or seven years ago, everyone else is new,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat makes me very proud. We are building something very special here with the project with Mikel.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame I only have two years more on my contract. Let‚Äôs see what happens after two years, but I am seeing a big, big future for this club.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my seventh year now here. I saw the good things, I saw the bad things. ‚ÄúAfter what happened to me two and a half, three years ago I tried to come back as strong as possible with the new guys as well. I give them respect. They give me respect as well.¬† ‚ÄúI try to treat everyone the same, it doesn‚Äôt matter the age. For me, age is only a number.¬† ‚ÄúIn the end you only have to show yourself on the pitch, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre 18, 30 or over 35. If you deserve to play you‚Äôll play. If not, you don‚Äôt deserve it.¬†I‚Äôm not a guy looking too much at the numbers if I‚Äôm honest.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-xhaka-opinions-players/blta7f8e23efc2d0edb,Charles Watts,23a680da-159a-4550-ac9e-6eef79ef706d
Outgoing Man Utd star Cavani labelled a 'disgrace' by Scholes as club legend reflects on 'embarrassing' 2021-22 season,"Manchester United forward Edinson Cavani has been labelled a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù by club legend Paul Scholes, who questioned his commitment during the 2021-22 season. The Uruguayan scored just two goals in 20 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils during a difficult campaign for the club. The former Paris Saint-Germain striker is out of contract next month and it has already been confirmed that he will not be offered fresh terms. Cavani scored 17 goals during a profitable first season at Old Trafford, which made a one-year extension to his contract seem like a shrewd move by the club last summer. However, he has struggled for regular action during his second campaign due to a combination of injury, loss of form and the summer arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. Scholes, however, believes Cavani was not always fully committed to the cause, citing his absence from the squad for February‚Äôs FA Cup defeat against Middlesbrough as an example. The former England midfielder believes Cavani‚Äôs plight is symbolic of United‚Äôs poor season in general, which saw them finish sixth in the Premier League. Scholes also questions whether new boss Erik ten Hag will get the required backing from the club‚Äôs hierarchy to revive their fortunes. ""Cavani I think was a disgrace this year, he hardly ever played,‚Äù he has told Premier League Productions. ""He pulled out of the Middlesbrough game because he had to travel back from wherever he was. ""Funnily enough, since that Middlesbrough game I think I heard last night United have won only five out of 18 games or something since then. ""It's been embarrassing, this manager [Ten Hag] now needs backing. ""Who's going to help him do that? The club upstairs is still a bit of a mess, we don't really know."" United interim boss Ralf Rangnick confirmed Cavani's appearance against Crystal Palace last weekend would be his last for the club with his contract set to expire on June 30. His Red Devils career ended on a sour note when he appeared to give a supporter the middle finger as he boarded the team bus after the game at Selhurst Park. The 35-year-old has been linked with a move to Spain while clubs in South America are also believed to be keen on a deal.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-cavani-disgrace-scholes-club-legend-reflects/blt31eec653dc626df5,Tom Mallows,35039fca-c56a-4940-84a2-b8a9ac4edcfd
Why was Kai Havertz not sent off for his elbow on Dan Burn in Chelsea vs Newcastle? ,"Kai Havertz found himself at the centre of a controversial incident during Chelsea‚Äôs clash with Newcastle at Stamford Bridge, with the German forward catching Premier League rival Dan Burn with a raised elbow. A coming together between the Blues attacker and Magpies defender occurred five minutes before half-time of an entertaining encounter that delivered plenty of passion despite chances proving hard to come by at both ends of the field. Havertz was allowed to stay on the pitch after tangling with Burn, but questions were asked of whether a man with Champions League and Club World Cup-winning goals to his name should have been shown a red card. Both men looked to challenge for a high ball in the 40th minute of a keenly-fought contest in west London ‚Äì in what was Chelsea‚Äôs first outing on home soil since club owner Roman Abramovich saw his assets frozen by the UK government. Towering Newcastle defender Burn was always favourite to emerge victorious in an aerial challenge, given his height advantage, but Havertz was never going to give up the fight. He flung himself towards the ball, but led with his arm and kept an elbow raised when coming into contact with Burn. üö® ""It doesn't look great.""VAR controversy as Kai Havertz catches Dan Burn with an elbow.

There was a VAR review as Newcastle players called for harsher punishment, but the on-field call stood. That is because video technology did not consider a clear and obvious error to have been made, leaving Havertz free to remain on the field. Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher was on co-commentary duty for Sky Sports at the time of the incident and said: ‚ÄúYou look at Havertz's arm there. It doesn't look great. Yellow card is probably right. ‚ÄúIt's similar to the Sadio Mane one against Cesar Azpilicueta. It fits into that category of a little more than a yellow and not quite a red.‚Äù Another former Reds star, Jamie Redknapp, said during the half-time break: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a very dangerous challenge by Havertz. ‚ÄúYou have to use your arms for elevation [but] his elbow is high and he catches him on the side of his face. He could have fractured his cheekbone.‚Äù Ex-Chelsea frontman Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink agreed with Redknapp, saying Havertz had been a bit ‚Äúnaughty‚Äù, but former Manchester City defender Micah Richards was of the opinion that the Chelsea frontman meant no harm and had not gone out of his way to tag Burn.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/why-kai-havertz-not-sent-off-elbow-dan-burn-chelsea/blt788f71d3d34e3fad,Chris Burton,6a791460-50cf-4bc1-a570-381c4aadd635

'Intellectual dishonesty'? Allegri's Mourinho moment highlights Juventus' identity crisis after Champions League humiliation,"Massimiliano Allegri was clearly annoyed, but nobody knew with whom. When the full-time whistle blew at the end of Wednesday night's humiliating 3-0 loss at home to Villarreal, the Juventus coach immediately set off as if to remonstrate with someone. He insisted afterwards, though, ""I wasn't angry with anyone"" ‚Äì and there was certainly no adversary, official or external figure he could blame for his side's Champions League last-16 exit. The referee had given Villarreal two penalties, but both were merited. His players had performed reasonably well for 75 minutes and, as Juan Cuadrado pointed out, tried to do exactly what their boss had asked of them. Villarreal's negativity was unsurprisingly a source of frustration, but Allegri could hardly take issue with Unai Emery's tactics, given he has employed a painfully pragmatic approach all season long. In the end, then, the Tuscan had nobody to lash out at other than the journalists who attended the post-match inquest. Indeed, while Danilo was apologising to the supporters and Cuadrado was conceding Juve could have no excuses for such a shocking last-16 exit, their boss was in the press room accusing anyone trying to frame this as a ""failure"" of ""intellectual dishonesty"". He sounded like a man in denial, desperately reciting a page out of the Jose Mourinho playbook. This was Allegri's ""football heritage"" moment. The Juve coach was undoubtedly correct when he said that there are 10 better teams in the Champions League than the Bianconeri. But the point is that Villarreal should not be one of them. VILLARREAL BEAT JUVENTUS 3-0 IN TURIN TO KNOCK THEM OUT OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE üò± pic.twitter.com/pWfj9axztH The seventh-best team in La Liga, who hail from a town of 50,000 people, have never even featured in Deloitte's Football Money League. Juventus have ranked 10th for the past two years. Money is not everything in football, but it is not far off these days, so it is only right that the richest clubs are judged by higher standards. And the fact is that the Bianconeri have been eliminated from the Champions League by teams with far smaller budgets for four consecutive seasons: Ajax, Lyon, Porto and now Villarreal. Allegri essentially claimed that he was merely spitting truths on Wednesday night; that Juve need to realise that they are no longer among Europe's elite. Recent results have certainly hammered that home from a sporting perspective, but while early elimination may no longer come as a surprise, that does not make it any less shocking for a club of Juve's resources. A familiarity with failure does not make it forgivable. And adopting a small-club mentality at a footballing powerhouse like Juve is unacceptable. This is not all on Allegri, of course. He may now be a part of the problem, but he is not the cause of this identity crisis. As Claudio Marchisio said during his punditry duties on Amazon Prime, ""One can talk of a Champions League curse for Juve if you lose finals. ""But if you go out in the last 16 three years in a row, it's a more profound problem: of identity, of style, of players."" Remember, Allegri wanted to overhaul the squad before being pushed out of the club in 2019. It wasn't he who allowed transfer market maestro Beppe Marotta to leave for Inter.  It wasn't he who came up with the ill-advised Cristiano Ronaldo project. And it wasn't he who oversaw the Portuguese forward's poorly timed departure. Allegri feels as if he has done a good job in the circumstances; that there needs to be a reappraisal of where Juve are as a club right now. There is some merit in that argument and he does still have his supporters. Patrice Evra, for example, kept apologising for repeating himself during his appearance on Amazon Prime because he just could not get over how far the standard of the Juve squad had fallen since his time in Turin. The former France full-back even went so far as to claim that Allegri is actually ""working miracles"", given ""there is no quality, especially in midfield."" ""We had Marchisio, [Arturo] Vidal, [Andrea] Pirlo, [Paul] Pogba,"" Evra said. ""I'm sorry, I don't want to speak about the past again, but this is Juve."" It was, maybe. But it is not anymore. Juve have had a creative vacuum in midfield for many years now, and Arthur still does not look like the man to fill it. Evra attacked the Brazilian for failing to switch the play once during the game, while Fabio Capello over on Sky Sport Italia wheeled out one of his preferred put-downs by once again accusing Arthur of ""playing rugby"": just passing the ball side to side. There were worse performers than the former Barcelona man, though. Midfielder Adrien Rabiot was again ""useless"", as the Gazzetta dello Sport put it in their match ratings, while defender Daniele Rugani sadly reminded everyone why he will always be a liability at this level by giving away the crucial first penalty. Of course, it was unfair to single out any particular player after what was, and is, a collective failure ‚Äì whether Allegri wants to accept it as such or not. Villarreal represented yet another favourable draw for Juve, and they could not have benefited from a better start to the tie, with Dusan Vlahovic giving them the lead just over 30 seconds into the first leg at El Madrigal. That they failed to add to their advantage over the 179 minutes that followed is a damning indictment of both the players and their coach. Indeed, this cannot be passed off as anything other than an embarrassment. Last-16 elimination should not be par for the course for Juve. As Arrigo Sacchi pointed out, this was undeniably yet another step backwards for the Bianconeri. Allegri may have inherited a lot of problems, problems which he foresaw three years ago, but he is not getting the best out of this squad and his side does not play anything like the kind of progressive football required at this level. His conservative, catenaccio-like tactics have seen them scrape one narrow win after another in Serie A, but they were always going to be exposed in Europe. ""If there's no innovation, courage or intelligence, one cannot think of playing well,"" Sacchi told the Gazzetta. ""Juve were waiting for something from an individual or a mistake by their opponent."" Instead, it was Juve who erred first, and then again and again, and it was difficult to have any sympathy for the club run by the man who is pushing so hard for a Super League. This is a mess all of their own making and searching for salvation at the expense of other, supposedly 'lesser' clubs, is winning them few friends. Allegri was quick to point out that there is still much to play for this season. Juve are in the Coppa Italia semi-finals and occupy the fourth and final Champions League spot in Serie A. He urged reporters on Wednesday night: ""Wait before organising our funeral."" But this looks like a team, and indeed a club, in dire need of major surgery. Juve were lucky enough to receive a major cash injection from parent company EXOR just before Christmas, which facilitated the ‚Ç¨75 million signing of Vlahovic in January. The thinking behind that mid-season gamble was that the risk would be worth the reward, with the former Fiorentina forward capable of adding a cutting edge to a blunt side, thus guaranteeing a place in next season's Champions League. That is now absolutely imperative, from both a sporting and financial perspective. Juve simply will not be able to sign the players they need to improve the squad without the promise of Champions League football, and the prize money that comes with it. They are already at risk of losing star defender Matthijs de Ligt, as it is. So, anything less than a fourth-place finish in Serie A will not be classed as anything other than a failure. To even suggest otherwise really would be intellectual dishonesty.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/allegri-intellectual-dishonesty-juventus-champions-league/bltf802ae8dfdbee88d,Mark Doyle,7807d71d-108f-4ca2-910f-db0e343b997c

The Belgian was then ruled out of the subsequent Premier League clash with Southampton due to injury, and has not recovered in time for the Blues' trip to Santiago Bernabeu. Tuchel confirmed the news in his final press conference before Tuesday's second leg, telling reporters: ""Callum Hudson-Odoi out, Ben Chilwell out, Romelu Lukaku will not travel."" The German head coach also revealed Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta, who missed the 6-0 win against Southampton due to Covid-19, is now free of the illness and available for selection again.  ‚ÄúAzpilicueta has tested negative and is in the group.

'Xavi's comments made us really happy' ‚Äì Barcelona star Rolfo relishing praise for women‚Äôs team ahead of Real Madrid clash,"Barcelona star Fridolina Rolfo says praise for the women‚Äôs side from Xavi is something that has pleased the whole squad ‚Äì and that she and her team-mates want to show the world how good they are against Real Madrid on Wednesday. Xavi described Barca Femeni as ‚Äúan example for the men‚Äôs team‚Äù after their league title triumph two weeks ago, Jonatan Giraldez‚Äôs side winning the trophy with a 100 per cent record. After a tough first leg in the Women‚Äôs Champions League quarter-finals against the club‚Äôs traditional rivals, Rolfo wants to back that praise up this week as the competition‚Äôs next round of games get underway ‚Äì Barca to play theirs at a sold-out Camp Nou. Xavi lauded Giraldez‚Äôs team earlier this month, saying: ""For several years [the women's team] have been showing us the way with how they play, how they compete and the hunger they have despite winning everything last year. ""We have been watching them and it's a wonder to see them play. They are leading the way in the same way as the Dream Team did in their day or as Pep [Guardiola's] Barca side did later. They are an example for the men's team."" Asked about those comments on Monday, speaking to media ahead of Wednesday‚Äôs game, Rolfo said: ‚ÄúThat's something the club are striving for - the playing style that we want to play, the typical Barca style. ‚ÄúOf course, it's something that makes us happy and I hope we can show the world and for women's football how we want to play and how good we are. That's the main goal.‚Äù Barca won the first leg of the quarter-final with Real Madrid 3-1, but only after the hosts went 1-0 up and competed with them like few teams have in the past two years. ‚ÄúI think it was good that we got this game because we were not happy with the first half,‚Äù Rolfo explained. ‚ÄúWe were not playing well. We talked about it at half-time and we changed some things. I think we really showed a great mentality in the second half and got out there and were really performing. ‚ÄúHopefully, we learned the lesson. Real Madrid, they were good - I don't know if it was a surprise, we know it's a great team, but if we compare it with the week before, it was another team that showed up there, if I have to say it like that. ‚ÄúIt was tough, but I'm really happy that we could change the game, turn it around in the second half and we were performing really well. Hopefully, we learned something from this.‚Äù The return leg will be much different to any game these Barcelona players have played, as it will not only allow them to play in front of fans at Camp Nou for the first time, but the club has also sold all of the tickets. It did so in just four days, too. The spectacle it could be is something Rolfo admits she cannot help but think about this week, adding: ‚ÄúIt's something we're really looking forward to and it's something I think about often. ‚ÄúIt's a game that every footballer wants to play. You're practising for these games. For me, it's a dream coming true already, before the game started. I'm really excited.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/xavi-comments-really-happy-barcelona-rolfo-praise-women-real/blt0b0d805b85b45fbe,Amee Ruszkai,9bc736cb-9e95-4212-8c87-99252b193c01
Liverpool's worst fears realised: FSG must spend this summer to end reliance on Salah & Mane,"It didn‚Äôt take long for the doom and gloom to arrive, did it? As the final whistle sounded at Anfield on Thursday night, the hashtag #FSGOut was trending as Liverpool fans took to Twitter to vent their annoyance at the club‚Äôs owners. Blimey, you might think, is a draw at home to Arsenal really that bad? Jurgen Klopp and his players, of course, struck a rather more optimistic tone following the Carabao Cup semi-final, first leg.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs half-time,‚Äù Klopp told his post-match press conference. ‚ÄúAll to play for next week in London,‚Äù posted Virgil van Dijk. Yet while it would take a brave soul to back against the Reds reaching their first domestic cup final in six years, there is a reason why supporters, whether on social media or otherwise, are feeling a little more pessimistic of late. To put it simply, they‚Äôre beginning to worry that history is repeating itself, and that their long-held fears about investment, squad depth and the reliance on certain individuals are being realised.¬† The past month has not been kind to Klopp‚Äôs side. Since beating Newcastle at Anfield on December 16, Liverpool have played six matches and the only one they‚Äôve won inside 90 minutes was against League One Shrewsbury, in the FA Cup last Sunday.¬† They‚Äôve dropped seven precious points in the Premier League and, on Thursday, failed to overcome a heavily-depleted Arsenal side that played three-quarters of the match with 10 men following Granit Xhaka‚Äôs red card. 17 shots, 0 goals.No Salah, no Mane, no goals for Liverpool üò¨ pic.twitter.com/sf3x4sM0vC Cause for concern? You‚Äôd have to say so, especially with memories of last season fresh in the mind.  Liverpool, remember, topped the table last Christmas, but didn‚Äôt win another league match until January 28, by which time they had slipped out of title contention, surrendered their proud unbeaten home league record and been knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United. The situation is not quite so bad this time around, of course, but Sunday‚Äôs home clash with Brentford is an important one. A win is necessary, and a convincing performance would not go amiss either. Certainly, the display against Arsenal did little to dispel fears that the next few weeks will be a struggle without the club‚Äôs Africa Cup of Nations stars, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Naby Keita.¬† Klopp may not like it, but when you have only one shot on target against 10 men, and it comes in the 92nd minute, the questions are only going to get louder. ‚ÄúAny team in the world would miss those players,‚Äù he admitted afterwards, though it was his suggestion that Liverpool could not have been better prepared to cope with their absence which stood out more. Plenty would disagree on that one. Rewind, if you will, to last summer, when many of the things we are talking about now were being discussed at length, whether on social media, on podcasts, radio phone-ins or by writers, correspondents and television pundits. How much, for example, would Liverpool miss Gini Wijnaldum‚Äôs skills and durability? Are Takumi Minamino and Divock Origi viable understudies for Salah and Mane? Could James Milner continue to defy Father Time, and was it really wise to bank on the likes of Keita, Thiago Alcantara and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain staying fit? These were all fair questions in July and August, and they are fair questions now.  Liverpool are not in a bad place ‚Äì still in the title race (just), still in the FA Cup, one game away from a League Cup final and with a Champions League last 16 tie against Inter to look forward to ‚Äì but could they, with a little more investment, be in a better one?¬† The answer is yes. They continue to move smartly in the transfer market. Diogo Jota was a gem of a signing, and both Kostas Tsimikas and Ibrahima Konate have added depth in key areas.  Thiago was nabbed from the reigning European champions and is a proven world-class performer, while Harvey Elliott and Kaide Gordon are two of the most exciting teenagers in the country.¬† They do good business, but do they do enough of it? They‚Äôre a fine team, coached superbly, but they continue to rely heavily on the same players, season after season, and the ones they would love to rely on more ‚Äì Thiago and Keita, most notably ‚Äì simply aren‚Äôt there often enough.¬† Others, like Minamino for example, are just not the answer, and probably never will be.  For all Klopp‚Äôs claims about how good the Japanese international looks in training, and for all the promise shown in occasional Carabao Cup outings, the fact is that Minamino was loaned out to Southampton last season, and that he has started only four Premier League games for the club since joining in January 2020. Even off the bench, Klopp rarely turns to him when a game is finely poised.¬† Origi is more useful as a substitute, as we know, but let‚Äôs not over-egg the Belgian‚Äôs contribution either.  He has 21 league goals in six-and-a-half years and would have been sold either last summer or the one before had a decent offer arrived.  He will almost certainly leave at the end of this season ‚Äì although Liverpool do have the option to extend his contract by a year, should he reach a set amount of appearances.¬† This is the real challenge facing Klopp and Liverpool‚Äôs staff, led currently by Michael Edwards, but which will have a new man, Julian Ward, at the helm from May.  Not only do they have key contract decisions to make (Salah, Mane, Firmino, Keita and Oxlade-Chamberlain are all up in less than 18 months), but they also need to plan for the future while refreshing the present.¬† Not an envious task, with Manchester City hurtling off into the distance and with Chelsea an ominous presence alongside. How do you compete with that, you might wonder. Liverpool did. Liverpool are. They were ‚Äòchampions of everything‚Äô not so long ago, don't forget. If they are to get back to such lofty heights, they'll need to start refreshing soon. The reliance on Salah and Mane cannot go on forever.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-fsg-must-spend-this-summer-to-end-reliance-salah/bltef0b0453bbb65814,Neil Jones,05217ac9-604e-4d9a-a760-3f5be4809625
Cristiano Ronaldo could still leave Manchester United this summer as Cunha emerges as fresh transfer target,"Cristiano Ronaldo could leave Manchester United before the transfer window closes. Erik ten Hag has been alarmed by the disastrous start to the season and wants to carry out major business before September 1 - which has raised the prospect of Ronaldo being sold.  United have been adamant that 37-year-old will be forced to see out the remainder of his contract, despite his determination to join a Champions League club. But that stance is believed to be softening after back-to-back defeats. The Portuguese legend could now be allowed to leave if another forward can be recruited.  United have spent the last week desperately scouring the market in search of striking reinforcements, with Atletico Madrid forward Matheus Cunha the latest on their radar.  Ten Hag also remains a big fan of Hakim Ziyech, who is set to leave Chelsea this summer - and the Dutchman could yet renew his interest in Ajax winger Antony.  PSV Eindhoven's Cody Gakpo has also been considered.  United have already missed out on Darwin Nunez and Benjamin Sesko this summer - and pulled out of a move for Marko Arnautovic after a furious fan backlash.  Ten Hag had been convinced he could get the best out of Ronaldo - even if just for the final year of his contract.  But uncertainty over the former Real Madrid and Juventus star's future has overshadowed the United manager's first months in the job.  Cristiano Ronaldo made his Manchester United debut on this day in 2003, the rest is history üêê pic.twitter.com/m3xldQGs80 Ronaldo was not part of the club's tour of Thailand and Australia - citing family reasons. And his lack of match fitness meant he could only come on as a substitute in the opening game of the season - the 2-1 defeat to Brighton.  On Saturday he cut a frustrated figure in the humiliating 4-0 defeat to Brentford - angrily turning away from travelling supporters after the final whistle and appearing not to acknowledge Ten Hag as he left the pitch.  There are concerns that if Ronaldo remains at Old Trafford it will have a negative impact on the club.  While United have taken a strong stance on Ronaldo - senior figures are so alarmed by the start of the season that suitable offers could now be considered. Ronaldo, who is on around ¬£500,000-a-week, would still need to find a club willing to take him on, while United are likely to want a fee.  Clubs such as Chelsea were sounded out by his agent Jorge Mendes - but Thomas Tuchel personally took the decision not to pursue a move.  While Cunha is seen as a potential target for United, it is not clear if Ronaldo could be used as part of that deal.  Sources at Atletico insist they have received no formal bid for the Brazilian and do not want to sell.  Cunha only joined Atletico from Hertha Berlin for ¬£22 million (¬£31m) last year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/cristiano-ronaldo-still-leave-manchester-united-this-summer/blt669d29464310a562,James Robson,7e0c1eef-6435-4338-9ffc-1eb35d30d1de
Gnabry contemplating Bayern Munich exit amid Real Madrid & Liverpool transfer interest,"Bayern Munich star Serge Gnabry is contemplating a summer exit amid transfer interest from Real Madrid and Liverpool, GOAL can confirm. Gnabry has been a key player for Bayern since joining the club from Werder Bremen in 2017, recording 61 goals and 40 assists in 163 games. The 26-year-old has won 10 trophies at Allianz Arena, including three Bundesliga titles and the Champions League, but speculation over his future is now raging as he approaches the final year of his contract. GOAL understands that Bayern have been trying to tie Gnabry down to fresh terms but are not yet close to reaching any kind of renewal agreement. The Germany international wants to make sure he is making the right decision with regards to how he continues his career, with sporting goals and personal achievements equally as important to him as financial gain. Julian Nagelsmann expressed his desire to keep hold of Gnabry at a press conference last week, with the Bayern boss telling reporters: ""He has everything a player needs and a coach likes. In the end, it's a matter of negotiation between the club and the player, but I'm sure we'll fix it. I'd like to keep him."" Bayern are aware that they will have to make Gnabry one of their highest-paid players in order to retain his services, but getting his current ‚Ç¨8 million (¬£7m/$9m) per-year salary off their books could actually be in their best interests as they look to balance their accounts amid the economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. GOAL has learned that Madrid have already contacted Gnabry's representatives to discuss his availability, having followed his progress at Bayern closely over the last five years. It has been reported that the former Arsenal attacker might be convinced to head to Santiago Bernabeu so he can reunite with former Bayern team-mate David Alaba. Gnabry remains close friends with Alaba and has visited the defender in Spain regularly since his move to Madrid last summer. Madrid are not the only club interested in Gnabry, though, as GOAL can confirm that Liverpool and Juventus are also keeping a close eye on his situation at Allianz Arena. Liverpool have identified Gnabry as a potential replacement for Mohamed Salah, who is being linked with a transfer amid similar struggles to negotiate a new contract at Anfield, with Jurgen Klopp thought to be a keen admirer of the Bayern attacker. Juventus, meanwhile, have set their sights on Gnabry as they scour the market for players edging towards free agency, and could look to arrange an initial loan deal when the summer window opens.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gnabry-contemplating-bayern-munich-exit-amid-real-madrid-and/blt70bc79e8b7001859,Jorge C.

'Vlahovic is better than Haaland!' - Serbian FA president makes bold claim about Juventus and Man City strikers,"Dusan Vlahovic is a better player than Erling Haaland, claims Serbian FA president Nenad Bjekovic, who believes the Juventus frontman is ""more complete"" than his Manchester City counterpart. Haaland has made a major transfer from Borussia Dortmund to join the Premier League champions this summer, and is expected to thrive at his new club. But Serbia international Vlahovic could rival his crown for the most exciting young forward in the European game - and Bjekovic thinks his countryman may have the edge. ""Vlahovic is better and more complete than Haaland,"" Bjekovic told Tuttosport when asked to stack the two stars together. ""The Norwegian has devastating power, but Dusan is not inferior: there is also very little difference in their height.  ""But the Juventus forward‚Äôs variety and styles of player is better. Manchester City and Juventus paid more or less the same fee, including commissions, to sign the two this year from Borussia Dortmund and Fiorentina."" The Citizens recruit was the top goalscorer in the Champions League in 2020-21 before injury hampered his form last term, while he already sits ninth on Norway's all-time goalscorer list in international football.

Ronaldo: Man Utd have 'no limits' if they play with togetherness,"Cristiano Ronaldo has said Manchester United have ""no limits"" when they play with togetherness and work hard. His comments come after he scored a hat-trick in a 3-2 victory over Tottenham on Saturday. The Red Devils have been rumoured to be divided in the dressing room, but that wasn't apparent against Spurs as they earned a hard-fought victory to boost their top-four hopes. ""Tremendously happy with my first hat-trick since I came back to Old Trafford!"" wrote Ronaldo on Instagram after the match. ""Nothing beats the feeling of being back on the pitch and help the team with goals and effort.

Manchester United were effusive in their praise of Ronaldo following the match, with midfielder Paul Pogba declaring him to be ""the best striker in history"". Pogba also refuted reports that Ronaldo has been at the centre of a dressing room divide behind closed doors.

'Americans can play football too!' - Aaronson's defiant message as USMNT star makes goal-scoring impact at Leeds,"Brenden Aaronson is a Premier League goalscorer at Leeds and, with the likes of Christian Pulisic and Giovani Reyna also starring in Europe, the USMNT midfielder is eager to point out that ‚ÄúAmericans can play football too‚Äù.

The Super Eagles take on the Black Stars at Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on Friday, before concluding this play-offs round with the second leg at Abuja National Stadium four days later. Although Everton‚Äôs Alex Iwobi is suspended, Nigeria‚Äôs bid for a fourth straight World Cup appearance has been boosted by the availability of Ighalo and Osimhen, who missed the Africa Cup of Nations finals earlier this year. Also returning for Nigeria after missing Afcon are Watford forward Emmanuel Dennis and Rangers FC defender Leon Balogun.

Salah's Liverpool legacy at risk if contract situation isn't resolved says Enrique,"Former Liverpool defender Jose Enrique believes both the club and Mohamed Salah will make a massive mistake if The Reds don't hand a new deal to the Egyptian superstar. The current contract between the winger and the Merseyside team is set to expire in 2023 and, according to reports, the two parties have failed to reach an agreement despite negotiations taking place and a Liverpool offer being made. Salah is believed to want a package in the region of ¬£300,000 a week to stay. And Enrique believes both the player and the club would lose if Liverpool cannot accommodate the 29-year-old's demands.  ""I think it would be a big loss for him and for the club [if he left],"" Enrique told Sport Bible. ""At the moment he is being completely respectful. I respect both sides, to be honest. Salah is seeing other world-class players who are playing in different positions but are earning a lot more than him.  ""He could ask ‚Äòwhy am I not earning what they are earning? I am the best player this season in the Premier League, and in the world as well."" Enrique does, however, understand that Salah's new contract could have an impact across the Liverpool squad.  ""I understand his position and I understand at the same time the club‚Äôs position as well. They have a wage structure at the club. I‚Äôm sure they will want Salah to be the best earner at the club, but they maybe don‚Äôt want to approach those numbers,"" Enrique continued. ""I know what will happen, everyone knows.

Salah: Real Madrid midfielder Valverde unhappy with Liverpool star's comments,"Real Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde believes Mohamed Salah's comment on social media, where he said the Reds ""have a score to settle"" with the La Liga champions in the Champions League final shows a lack of respect for the opponent's badge.

Liverpool set to recall Williams from Swansea loan with Phillips expected to leave in January,"Liverpool are set to recall Rhys Williams from his loan spell at Swansea, with the Reds expecting Nat Phillips to leave the club before the end of the transfer window. Williams, 20, has seen opportunities limited since joining the Championship club on deadline day in August. The centre-back has made only seven appearances in all competitions, and is expected to return to Merseyside this week. That would pave the way for Phillips‚Äô exit. The 24-year-old is keen to secure regular first-team football and is attracting interest from a host of clubs. Liverpool, GOAL can reveal, turned down an offer from Watford for Phillips earlier this month.¬† The Hornets wanted to take the former Bolton man on loan until the end of the season, with an obligation to make the move permanent should they avoid relegation. Liverpool though are keen for a straight sale, and they are insisting their valuation of ¬£15 million ($20m) is fair.¬† Serie A side Napoli were another side to express interest, but instead chose to sign Axel Tuanzebe on loan from Manchester United, while West Ham are long-term admirers but would prefer to sign a centre-back capable of providing additional cover on the left if possible. Burnley may be a possibility, should Newcastle firm up their interest in James Tarkowski, while Phillips also has suitors in the Bundesliga. The defender, who played a key role in securing Champions League qualification for Liverpool last season, has this week returned to full contact training following the fractured cheekbone he suffered against AC Milan in the San Siro last month. Phillips has played three times for the first-team this season.¬† Williams, like Phillips, had a big role to play in Liverpool‚Äôs run to a top-four finish last term.¬† The Academy product made 19 appearances in all competitions last season, including nine in the Premier League, and had hoped to play regularly when joining Swansea at the end of the summer window. However he has started just five games since, the last of which came against Middlesbrough on December 4, and Liverpool believe his development would be best served back training with Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs first-team squad and providing cover as fifth-choice centre-back until the end of the season.¬† The Reds have already recalled another youngster, midfielder Leighton Clarkson, from a loan spell at Blackburn, and could do the same with striker Paul Glatzel, who has featured infrequently in League Two with Tranmere.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-recall-williams-swansea-loan-phillips-january/blte3b40e27b2373270,Neil Jones,6adb8ef8-b62e-4838-8de6-1e48db46c31a
Do Man City really need Pogba? De Bruyne and Gundogan star to take control of title race,"Match statistics: Manchester City 5-0 Newcastle If Paul Pogba was watching Manchester City dismantle Newcastle on Sunday, he would likely have been thinking one of two things.  Possibly, 'I want a part of that,' as Pep Guardiola's side took a step closer to a fourth Premier League title in five seasons with a brilliant performance.  Alternatively, Pogba may have wondered if opportunities at the Etihad Stadium could be difficult to come by, with their already sublime midfield the ticking heartbeat for the defending champions.  The Manchester United star has emerged as a shock transfer target for City when he becomes available on a free transfer at the end of the season.  But the players he would then be battling with for a starting berth provided the perfect checklist of what would be required across the city for a superstar that has largely disappointed in six underwhelming years down the road at Old Trafford. With the potential for City's season to come crashing down after their heartbreaking Champions League defeat at Real Madrid in midweek, Pep Guardiola received the perfect response. Ilkay Gundogan, whose place might be placed most under threat by the arrival of a player such as Pogba, epitomised City's desire inside the opening minutes, when he matched the lightning quick Allan Saint-Maximin in a 40-yard foot race as the Newcastle winger threatened to escape.  But it was at the other end where the Germany international was most influential, on a day when the tension of the title race was never allowed to grow.  First, Gundogan's perfect crossfield pass picked out Joao Cancelo, who coolly nodded into the path of Raheem Sterling to score the crucial opener. Then, his drilled 20-yard volley proved too much for Martin Dubravka, and the goalkeeper's spill was eventually turned in by Aymeric Laporte for City's second. Alongside him, Kevin De Bruyne, who was strangely unproductive in midweek, was not going to let a second game pass him by. The Belgium star was back to his best, picking out impossible passes and driving at the Newcastle defence to open up attacking channels. Behind him, Rodri helped shut down the Newcastle threat before he and De Bruyne combined for City's third, the Spain midfielder heading in a corner at the near post. Those performances may well have given Pogba food for thought, and that is without mentioning Bernardo Silva, who was City's best performer at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. Then there is also Phil Foden, whose long-term future is likely to come as a more central attacking midfielder rather than a winger, with Guardiola seeing the 21-year-old as a player who has limitless potential.  The City boss was able to rest both Bernardo and Foden on Sunday, with difficult trips to Wolves and West Ham to follow in the next seven days before his side's final game of the season at home to Steven Gerrard's Aston Villa.  It shows the Catalan's deep trust in the charisma and character of his squad, something that has been questioned of Pogba at club level, despite his success and undoubted quality when playing for the France national team.  Make no mistake, Guardiola needed a response from his players if his side were to maintain control of the title race.  In another manic performance from his technical area, he cajoled, applauded, encouraged and directed them for the best part of an hour until the game was effectively won, but they already knew what was required.  With three fixtures remaining, they now have the safety net of being able to draw one game and still hold off the threat from Liverpool, while two late strikes by Foden and Sterling strengthened their goal difference safety net should City lose a match in the next fortnight. And so while Pogba contemplates his next move, City and their midfield superstars are focused solely on Molineux and winning on Wednesday. The thought of added competition in 2022-23 is unlikely to faze them now.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/do-man-city-really-need-pogba-de-bruyne-and-gundogan-star-to/blt1fa50b24d1e3af79,Jonathan Smith,3db073ca-5505-4093-bb7a-a897c991c5bb
Arsenal eye late move for Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz,"WHAT'S HAPPENING? The Gunners are pushing to bring in another midfielder due to injuries suffered by Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny. Mikel Arteta worked with Luiz before during their time together at Manchester City and the Brazilian is understood to be keen to reunite with the Spaniard in north London. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Luiz scored for Villa against Arsenal in their 2-1 defeat at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night.  But the Brazil international has less than one year left on his current contract and has so far resisted Villa's attempts to get him to sign a new deal. AND WHAT'S MORE: Speaking about Luiz's future after Wednesday night's game, Villa boss Steven Gerrard said: ""I‚Äôm not in control of that. There are more than two people who are in control of that and I am not one of them. I would like to keep him, he‚Äôs a fantastic player. I‚Äôve made that abundantly clear. ""We are not in a position where we need to lose our top players but at the same time Douglas has got a year to go and it‚Äôs one of those touchy situations where the club need to do what's best for the club, not necessarily what‚Äôs best for me."" IN THREE PHOTOS:    THE VERDICT: This would be a smart signing by Arsenal, if they can tempt Villa into doing business. Arteta knows Luiz well and at 24 he fits the profile of the type of player Arsenal want to bring to the club. Luiz would not replace Partey if the Ghanian is fit, but he would certainly improve the squad and bring more competition to the midfield. WHAT NEXT FOR ARSENAL?

Juventus open talks with Roma over move for ‚Ç¨50m-rated Zaniolo,"Juventus have made contract with Roma regarding a possible deal for Italy international midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo, GOAL has learned. The talented 22-year-old has registered on the recruitment radar in Turin for some time, but only now has that interest been formalised. Initial discussions have been held between the Serie A rivals, with the Bianconeri ready to step up their efforts to lure promising playmaker Zaniolo away from the Italian capital. It is understood that Roma value Zaniolo at around ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£43m/$53m). They saw him net the winning goal in their Europa Conference League final triumph over Feyenoord last season and will not part with one of their prized assets for less than his full market value. That could prove to be a stumbling block for Juve, but they have potential sweeteners up their sleeve. Brazilian midfielder Arthur Melo could be used as a makeweight in any move for Zaniolo, as the Bianconeri seek to soften the blow for the Giallorossi. While exploring the possibility of prising Zaniolo away from Roma, Juve remain keen on experienced Argentine forward Angel Di Maria. He has become a free agent after reaching the end of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, with GOAL confirming back in May that a move to land the 34-year-old South American had been made. Juve are still hopeful of getting paperwork signed there, and any agreement with Di Maria would not impact plans when it comes to Zaniolo. There is a chance with Zaniolo that a loan deal will be discussed that includes an option to buy at the end of the 2022-23 campaign. It would be quite a coup for Juve were they able to get the highly-rated Azzurri star on board, but there is acknowledgement at the Allianz Stadium that any proposal will not be easy to push through and that talks may drag on into the summer window for some time yet.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-talks-roma-50m-rated-italy-zaniolo/bltf22dad9884016603,Romeo Agresti,1b1dbcad-e7ee-426c-9faf-a3162248075d
"Eintracht Frankfurt vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Europa League favourites Barcelona travel to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday for the first leg of their quarter-final, with Xavi Hernandez's men aiming to continue their strong form. The Catalans are unbeaten (in 90 minutes) since December 8 and are highly fancied to progress against the side currently in ninth position in the Bundesliga. The Catalans have won both of their away games in the Europa League so far, recording victories at Galatasaray and Napoli. Xavi's men are offered at 4/6 (1.65) with bet365 to record another success while the hosts can be backed at 7/2 (4.50) and the draw is priced at 14/5 (3.80). Pierre-Emerick Aubamayeng has scored nine goals so far for Barcelona since joining in early February from Arsenal, with the Gabonese forward getting on the score sheet in both away games in the Europa League. The former Gunners captain is priced at 10/3 (4.33) to score first, while Ferran Torres can be backed at 9/2 (5.50) and Ousmane Dembele at 5/1 (6.00). The shortest priced Eintracht player to score first is Colombian striker Rafael Santos Borre who is available at 17/2 (9.50). Barca are likely to make changes to their starting XI although it is still likely to be a strong side fielded by the Catalans. The likes of Memphis Depay, Eric Garcia and Gavi could come into the team to freshen things up and there should be plenty of interest in backing the visitors to get among the goals, continuing their excellent run. The German side have kept just one clean sheet in their last 16 Europa League matches, while Barca have scored four goals in their last 11 games and will fancy their chances of claiming a first-leg victory. The Catalans can be backed at 11/8 (2.38) to score in both halves which looks like an attractive option, while Barca to score over 1.5 goals is available at 8/13 (1.62).

Van Bronckhorst: Why Nigeria‚Äôs Bassey missed Rangers‚Äô big win against St. Mirren,"Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst has explained his decision to leave out defender Calvin Bassey from his matchday squad for the 4-0 Scottish Premiership victory against St. Mirren on Sunday. Despite, his recent good run of form, the 22-year-old Nigeria defender did not make the trip to Paisley 2021 Stadium as a hat-trick from Kemar Roofe and a superb strike from his Super Eagles compatriot Joe Aribo gave the Gers the huge win. Speaking after the game, Van Bronckhorst explained the decision to Rangers TV: ‚ÄúWe have to mix things a little bit up because we have a hectic schedule. ‚ÄúI didn't put Jack and Calvin [Bassey] in the squad today [Sunday] so they are fresh for Thursday's second leg against Braga.‚Äù Meanwhile, Van Bronckhorst believes Aribo‚Äôs goal will give him more confidence ahead of their following matches. The 25-year-old Nigeria international ended his dry spell in front of goal with a spectacular long-range drive. Aribo‚Äôs last goal for Rangers came in the 1-1 draw against Dundee United at Tannadice Park on February 20 and since then he had not scored in five straight top-flight matches. Against St. Mirren, Aribo was paired in the middle of the park with John Lundstram and former Arsenal player Aaron Ramsey and the Super Eagle scored a sensational strike after he hit a stunning, dipping effort from 25-yards out that sailed over Dean Lyness into the top corner. Asked about Aribo‚Äôs goal, the former Arsenal defender said:  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good, it's always good to get on the scoresheet especially for a striker, but also for Joe [Aribo]. ‚ÄúYou know he's an attack-minded player and gives him also a lot of confidence for the games ahead.‚Äù Van Bronckhorst has revealed the win will boost his charges to do well against Braga in the second leg meeting having lost the first leg battle 1-0 at Estadio Municipal de Braga. ‚ÄúWe said before the game we needed to win this game and get back to winning ways and we did,‚Äù Van Bronckhorst added. ‚ÄúWe won 4-0, no goals against us and I think it gives us confidence for Thursday and the games ahead. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident because we won today. But we‚Äôre also confident that we can get a win at home in Europe like we‚Äôve shown in the past. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs everything to play for. It‚Äôs to reach the semi-final of a European competition, so it‚Äôs something we need to fight for and to work hard on. On Thursday we‚Äôll have the support of the crowd.

"'Close the votes, Benzema won it' - Ballon d'Or debate is over, insists Thierry Henry","Karim Benzema has been backed to win this year's Ballon d'Or by Thierry Henry, who says the debate over who should win the award is over following Real Madrid's 14th Champions League triumph. Benzema was one of eight Madrid players to equal Cristiano Ronaldo's record of five Champions League wins on Saturday night as Carlo Ancelotti's side beat Liverpool 1-0 in the 2021-22 final. Vinicius Junior grabbed the only goal at the Stade de France, but Benzema finished as the top scorer in the competition with 15 to his name from 12 appearances, and Henry believes he has been the best player in the world this season. The former Arsenal and France striker says the vote for the 2022 Ballon d'Or winner should already be closed as he insists that Benzema is the standout candidate for the individual prize.         ""I just wanted to say something for France Football or whoever is voting. Close the votes, Benzema won it. Bye,"" Henry said after covering the final for CBS Sports. France head coach Didier Deschamps has also expressed his belief that Benzema deserves to be recognised with the Golden Ball in light of Madrid's latest Champions League triumph. The striker was also Madrid's leading scorer as they clinched the Liga title, with Deschamps saying to Telefoot when asked if he should win the accolade: ""The answer is simple: yes. This new title and the sporting season achieved with his team, and what he was able to do, he was so decisive.  ""Obviously, he was already one of the favourites and he deserves amply this reward."" Benzema doesn't think he could have done any more this season to win the Ballon d'Or, which has been shared 13 times between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo over the past 14 years, with his Madrid team-mate Luka Modric the only other winner during that period. However, the 34-year-old also says that a snub in the voting would not detract from his stellar campaign. ‚ÄúObviously, I finished my season, now I will join up with the national team,"" Benzema told Canal Plus. ""I think at club level I can't do better. We'll see what happens but in any case I'm proud of what I've achieved.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/close-the-votes-benzema-won-it-ballon-d-or-debate-thierry/blt215bffe70931e89c,James Westwood,3c8fd070-4348-43bf-a0a9-d84d7fb5d8dc

'I have a clear idea for Neymar' - New PSG boss Galtier calms down transfer talk for Brazilian star,"Christophe Galtier has confirmed that he wants Neymar to stay at Paris Saint-Germain, with the club's new head coach claiming to have a ""very clear idea"" of how to bring the best out of the Brazilian superstar. Former Lille manager Galtier inherited the managerial reins at Parc des Princes following Mauricio Pochettino's sacking on Tuesday morning. The Argentine paid the ultimate price for PSG's latest failure in the Champions League, which also sparked fresh rumours over Neymar's future at the club, but Galtier says that the 30-year-old will be central to his plans. GOAL has reported that PSG are ready to let Neymar go if they receive a suitable offer in the current transfer window, with the forward having largely failed to live up to his world-record ‚Ç¨222 million (¬£191m/$228m) price tag since joining the club from Barcelona in 2017. A potential return to Camp Nou has been suggested for Neymar, while Premier League trio Chelsea, Manchester United and Newcastle have also been credited with an interest in his services, but Galtier doesn't want to see such a talented player walk through the exit doors. ""Neymar is a world-class player, what coach wouldn't want him in his squad. We have to find a balance in the team,"" the Frenchman said in his first press conference. ""I have a very clear idea of what I want from him. I haven't met him yet but I want him to stay with us."" Christophe Galtier is the new manager of PSG üá´üá∑ pic.twitter.com/LeAV97e5Fx Galtier also commented on Kylian Mbappe's decision to snub a transfer to Real Madrid in favour of signing a new three-year contract at Parc des Princes. The new PSG boss is glad that he will have the chance to work with the World Cup winner, but doesn't want him to become overburdened with responsibility due to his superstar status in Paris. ""As a Frenchman I am very happy that he is staying in France: it is good for our league and PSG. I have not had any exchange with him,"" Galtier said. ""I know what Kylian expects from the team. We know what he brings to the team. We must not give him all the weight of the result.

Explained: How football managers use ball boys and ball girls to help them win,"Football managers and players at the very highest level of the game find themselves performing under the brightest of spotlights, with instant success now demanded in every corner of the globe despite a finite number of trophies being up for grabs. With so much resting on each passing fixture, it comes as no surprise to find that tactics are taking on ever-increasing importance ‚Äì with coaches around the world seeking marginal gains that will offer them an upper hand in direct combat with any rival. The role that ball boys and ball girls play in the process can be overlooked at times, as they find themselves on the periphery of proceedings, but they may be more important than you think. Why is that the case and how are those roles on the sidelines filled? GOAL takes a look... The majority of ball boys and girls are selected from the respective academy systems of the clubs involved in whatever fixture requires their presence. The average age of those filling such a role is reported to be 15, although Manchester City are said to dip into their U12 and U14 youth ranks when looking to fill positions along the touchline and behind the goal. There is no set age limit for ball boys and girls, with decisions left in the hands of teams around the world when it comes to choosing who they use and when. While youth ranks are used to fill most of those positions, plenty of teams select youngsters from local leagues and schools that boast ties to the club in question. While ball boys and girls were once merely there to prevent players from having to go and retrieve the ball themselves when it went out of play, they now have an important part to play. An ever-growing number of coaches have recognised the value in working with those who are chosen to patrol the touchlines. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is said to have gone out of his way to talk up the role that ball boys and girls had to play in a Champions League quarter-final clash with Atletico Madrid at the Etihad Stadium on April 5, 2022. The Catalan tactician reportedly recorded a video message for the youngsters plucked from the Blues‚Äô academy ranks, with an inspirational pre-game rallying call making them aware that they were very much ‚Äúpart of a big match plan‚Äù. Guardiola wanted to ensure that Atletico were not allowed to engage in any time-wasting antics, with it requested that balls be returned to players from both sides as quickly as possible. City went on to win the game 1-0, while ultimately progressing to the semi-final stage, so, in theory, the concept worked to an extent. Another example of quick-thinking from a ball boy during a high-profile European encounter allowed Liverpool to complete their remarkable fightback against Barcelona in May 2019. The Reds needed goals in order to make the Champions League final that season, as they found themselves trailing by three, and stunned their La Liga opponents by drawing level on aggregate inside 56 minutes. Divock Origi then registered a famous tie-winning strike in the 79th-minute, with the ball passed quickly to Trent Alexander-Arnold as he prepared to take a corner, allowing a low delivery that was drilled into the box to catch Barca napping as a Belgian forward swept home. SIMPLY GENIUS ü§ØTrent Alexander-Arnold spots Barcelona napping and Divock Origi makes no mistake!!!4-0 Liverpool üò±Wow. pic.twitter.com/K05v1jgazZ Later that year, in November 2019, then Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho talked up the footballing brain of 15-year-old ball boy Callum Hynes when his quick reactions contributed to Serge Aurier taking a throw which led to Harry Kane finding the target in a Champions League meeting with Olympiacos that Spurs would go on to win 4-2. Jose Mourinho makes sure the ball boy gets the respect he deserves for the assist üëèüëèüëèClass. pic.twitter.com/4zWt0Jxwco Mourinho said: ""I love intelligent ball boys like I was. I was a brilliant ball boy as a kid. And this kid today was brilliant. He reads the game, understands the game and made an important assist. ""He's not there just to look to the stands, lights or scarves. He's living the game and playing it very well."" There have also been countless instances down the years of ball boys and girls being given towels that can be used to help dry the ball for those that favour a long throw ‚Äì with said act of generosity not always extended to players from both sides. While benefits have been found in getting ball boys and girls to speed up play, they can often be encouraged to slow things down. Time wasting is not allowed on or off the field, with cards handed out to players and coaches who seek to run down the clock, but it is virtually impossible to eradicate entirely. Any side clinging on to a lead heading into the final stages of any given contest is going to be in no rush to get on with the game. One famous incident of a ball boy getting heavily involved in that process came in January 2013 when Charlie Morgan took to lying on the ball during a League Cup clash between Swansea City and Chelsea. Blues star Eden Hazard did not take too kindly to those antics and was shown a straight red card after trying to kick the ball free. Following a Europa League semi-final clash against Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022, West Ham boss David Moyes apologised to a ball boy after kicking a ball in his direction in a moment of anger.  Moyes explained: ""He threw it very short when he could‚Äôve thrown me the ball, he chose to leave it short but as I said, I apologise for that but it was a big game we were trying to win.""

'Pepe's in the last chance saloon' - Arsenal's ¬£72m signing running out of time to save Emirates career,"Arsenal saw the best of Nicolas Pepe last time they were in action at Wolves. The Gunners' record signing was unplayable at times during the first half at Molineux in February 2021, scoring a wonderful individual goal to put the visitors ahead. A controversial red card for David Luiz seconds before the interval turned the game on its head, however, and ultimately allowed Wolves to go on to claim all three points. But Pepe‚Äôs first-half display was a clear indicator of just how dangerous he can be when he is in full flow. Unfortunately for Arsenal, those types of performances have been few and far between since his arrival from Lille in the summer of 2019. Indeed, inconsistency has plagued Pepe's time in North London. A strong end to last season, when he scored eight times in 11 games to finish the campaign as Arsenal‚Äôs second top scorer in all competitions with 16, suggested the winger could be set for a stellar 2021-22. But that has not been the case, with Pepe having started just five league games, with the last of those coming during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on October 18. That is mainly down to the impressive form of Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli, who have both been exceptional on the left-hand side of the attack. However, prior to the winter break, Mikel Arteta was even choosing to bring on Eddie Nketiah ahead of Pepe ‚Äì an indicator of just how far down the pecking order the Ivory Coast international has fallen. ‚ÄúWith the amount of games we‚Äôre having, there‚Äôs not enough room,‚Äù Arteta said, when quizzed on Pepe‚Äôs lack of involvement during the first half of the season. ""Nico needs more opportunities to show what he can do and, in the last few games, he hasn‚Äôt had them. But I have to try to make the decision based on what I see every day. ‚ÄúNico is really willing to help the team. The reality is that in the position that he‚Äôs playing, Bukayo [Saka] is there and has been fantastic.‚Äù Pepe has undeniably enjoyed patches of good form. As well as last season's late goal glut, he also impressed during final months of his first campaign in England, when he played a key role in the FA Cup success, setting up goals for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in both the semi-final and the final. However, on the whole, he has failed to justify the ¬£72 million ($97m) transfer fee that Arsenal paid Lille to bring him to the Emirates. And with his contract now approaching its final two years, a big decision is looming this summer when it comes to the 26-year-old. Arsenal must decide whether to convince him to sign a new deal or cut their losses. ‚ÄúI¬†think Pepe might be in the last chance saloon,‚Äù Arsenal legend Ian Wright said on his podcast earlier this month. ‚ÄúUp to this point, [Arteta] has not used Pepe in any way that makes me think he's got love for Pepe.‚Äù The next few months are going to be crucial to Pepe‚Äôs chances of making a success of his time in north London. Although he will no doubt be back on the bench on Thursday night when Arteta‚Äôs side return to Premier League action at Wolves, the departure of Aubameyang to Barcelona could open up some opportunities for him. A lack of goals has been a problem for Arsenal all season and while Pepe does have his faults, his finishing is usually impressive and he is always a threat when he is on the pitch. Even this season, having been in and out of the side, he averages 2.8 shots per game, which is more than Saka, Smith Rowe, Martinelli and Alexandre Lacazette. He also averages 0.58 assists per 90 minutes, and 2.1 chances created ‚Äì again, numbers which are better than those of his fellow forwards. Pepe also ranks higher in touches per 90 minutes, passes, dribbles attempted and dribbles completed. Interestingly, the one statistic that has taken a big dip this season for Pepe is his shot conversion. In 2020-21, when he scored 16 goals in 47 games, he was finishing 17.8 per cent of his chances. This season, that has plummeted to 8.3%. For someone who has always shown himself to be quite clinical, that is somewhat surprising ‚Äì although it could be down to a lack of confidence given his lack of game time. There were signs during the Africa Cup of Nations, however, that he was getting his eye in again. While Ivory Coast largely disappointed during the tournament in Cameroon, Pepe impressed, scoring two goals and setting up another in his four appearances in the competition. With just Lacazette and Nketiah as Arsenal‚Äôs recognised central strikers following Aubameyang‚Äôs departure, Pepe could now find himself as an option for Arteta down the middle at times between now and the end of the season. ‚ÄúMikel has got to take a chance on that,‚Äù Wright has argued. It remains to be seen whether Pepe does emerge as an option for Arteta in the central attacking areas over the next few months. However, wherever Pepe plays, he needs to step up and grasp his opportunities when they do arrive during the 17 games that Arteta's side still have to play this season. His Arsenal career could depend on it.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pepe-last-chance-saloon-arsenal-record-signing-save-emirates/blt35c49c773901d6a3,Charles Watts,d681eff7-5f5d-4269-8130-732979bf0000
Abramovich statement a 'cowardly approach' says Neville as Carragher says Chelsea have 'embarrassed themselves' by not mentioning Ukraine,"Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville have both hit out at Chelsea and the club's owner Roman Abramovich amid a continuing firestorm over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich, who has been criticised over alleged close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, announced on Saturday he had passed the ""stewardship"" of Chelsea to the club's charitable foundation. The club followed with a brief statement on Sunday, which reads: ""The situation in Ukraine is horrific and devastating. Chelsea FC‚Äôs thoughts are with everyone in Ukraine. Everyone at the club is praying for peace."" Speaking on Sky Sports, Neville hit out at Abramovich's gesture, saying it was clear that the Russian billionaire is still in charge. ""One of the smartest things that I think Roman Abramovich has done over the last 20 years is not speak, not make statements,"" Neville said. ""Because the statement that he made last night left more questions than answers. ""If anything I thought it was, to be fair, a cowardly approach to sort of throw a hospital pass to good people on the charitable and foundation board when it's quite clear he runs the club with Marina [Granovskaia, club director] and [technical and performance advisor] Petr Cech. ""There's no way that the charitable foundation of Chelsea is running the club and I'm not quite sure why Roman Abramovich made that statement. ""If he wanted to make a statement of any note it would have been whether he supports the war in Ukraine or he actually doesn't support the war in Ukraine."" üó£ ""These owners of the top 6 clubs are insulated from reality, they think they can put a smart PR team around them and con us.""@GNev2 gives his opinion on Roman Abramovich's statement about stepping away from Chelsea pic.twitter.com/4lQ1TppDqc Carragher piled on to Neville's comments, saying that Chelsea ""embarrassed themselves"" with their statement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve handled it really well.

I think it‚Äôs been really poor and they‚Äôve let themselves down badly,"" the ex-Liverpool defender said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they did that well either. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not worked out well for them at all, I think they‚Äôve embarrassed themselves. They should have been a lot stronger in what they said, and regarding Roman Abramovich passing on to Chelsea trustees, that‚Äôs not him relinquishing the club, stewardship is not ownership.

Mbappe trains in full after being named in PSG squad for Champions League clash with Real Madrid,"Kylian Mbappe has been included in Paris Saint-Germain's squad for their Champions League clash with Real Madrid after an injury scare, and came through training unscathed on the eve of the game. The 23-year-old fired PSG to a late 1-0 win in the first leg of the round of 16 tie at Parc des Princes to give the Ligue 1 leaders a narrow advantage to take to Santiago Bernabeu. Mauricio Pochettino's side were left concerned that they would have to finish the job without Mbappe after he picked up a knock in training, but he was present with the rest of his team-mates as they travelled to Spain on Tuesday morning. Mbappe sustained an injury during a PSG training session on Monday morning and subsequently underwent a series of medical exams to assess the damage. GOAL can confirm that the initial medical checks have not revealed a fracture, with the club releasing an update on his condition via their website: ""Kylian Mbappe received a shock on his left foot during training today. He was treated this afternoon.

Lionel Messi took the World Cup winner's spot in the number nine role but the French giants suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat at Nice, and Pochettino will be glad to have his top scorer available for selection again in Madrid. Mbappe has 24 goals to his name from 34 appearances for PSG this term, and it has been suggested that the outcome of the Champions League clash with the Blancos will have a major bearing on his future. GOAL has reported that Madrid are confident of signing Mbappe on a free transfer when his contract expires this summer, but PSG haven't given up on tying him down to fresh terms and their chances of reaching a renewal agreement will surely be boosted if he can help them knock the Liga giants out of Europe.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-a-doubt-for-psg-s-champions-league-clash-with-real-madrid-/blt405c841994ca1a8a,James Westwood,38fe952e-9693-43bf-b07f-7a991bf38f61
Barcelona have no business at money-spinning Maradona tribute,"On Monday, with their Champions League disappointment still fresh in the mind, Barcelona were handed another stiff European challenge. The Catalans will have to fight past Napoli for the right to advance in the Europa League, thus avoiding an indecently early end to the club's continental ventures in 2021-22. The timing of the draw, moreover, could not have been more appropriate; barely 24 hours after, they will be lining up in Saudi Arabia in a match that by rights should be showcasing the talents of their Europa League opponents. When discussing the career of Diego Armando Maradona, a few teams immediately come to mind: boyhood club Argentinos Juniors; his beloved Boca Juniors; Napoli, where he became a local legend; and, of course, Argentina, thanks to his exploits in the 1986 and 1990 World Cups. The late star also retained a soft spot in his heart for Newell's Old Boys, whom he represented for a short spell in the 1990s, while fans and players alike at his final employers Gimnasia revelled in his exploits on the bench up to the moment of his passing in November 2020. Barcelona, however, would not rank highly among that list of memorable ex-clubs. For that reason, it is rather jarring to see Xavi's men take on Boca in Tuesday's Maradona Cup, a money-spinning friendly that does less to remember the great man than to expose the commercial manoeuvrings which he often fought against. While he was alive, the Catalans certainly did not make any great efforts to remember Diego's fiery, injury-interrupted yet occasionally spectacular two-year spell at Camp Nou.  The man himself said as much to Marca in 2018 when he predicted with laudable prescience Lionel Messi's own acrimonious exit. ‚ÄúBarcelona forget their idols very quickly,‚Äù the then-Dorados coach claimed. ‚ÄúDon't do the same [with Messi] as they did with me, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Romario, with [Luis] Figo. ‚ÄúJust like that I can name a load of players who were kicked out of Barcelona because of jealousy. The fans are the ones who end up losing.‚Äù On another occasion he remarked to Clarin: ‚ÄúI knew that [Messi at Barca] would end poorly and I thought Leo would leave. ‚ÄúIt happened to me too. Barcelona is not an easy club and he has been there for a long time and was not treated as he deserved.‚Äù  It is surely no coincidence that when Messi netted for Barca following Diego's death, the shirt he revealed belonged not to his own club, but Newell's: a signal not just of his own allegiances, but also that his memories of his former Argentina coach as a player belonged back in Rosario rather than his adopted home in Europe. While clubs such as Boca, Napoli and Argentinos have carefully cultivated Maradona's hero status on an institutional level ‚Äì the latter two's stadiums carry his name, while during his lifetime he was a regular visitor to Boca's La Bombonera home and enjoyed his own private box at the ground ‚Äì Barca have never embraced the Argentine in the same manner, a feeling that was largely mutual. What will be wholly welcome from the Catalans' perspective, of course, is the prize for travelling to the Middle East. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barca will pick up a cool ‚Ç¨2 million (¬£1.7m/$2.25m) for taking part in the Maradona Cup, a fee which will not exactly end their financial worries overnight but will nevertheless be greeted with no little joy in the Camp Nou boardroom. Boca are expected to receive a similar sum for their participation, a small fortune in the local context due to the weakness of Argentina's economy and currency.  Napoli, meanwhile, are said to have priced themselves out of contention by requesting more than double the fee of their prospective Spanish opponents. Irrepressible as always, Partenopei president Aurelio De Laurentiis is looking into holding his own Maradona Cup next year with matches against the Argentina national team and another opponent. ‚ÄúI'd like it to be May 24, my birthday,‚Äù he told reporters in Italy. If all this, added to the bizarre plan to hold a friendly between European and South American teams in Riyadh ‚Äì Dubai, where he lived for several years as a coach and ambassador for football in the United Arab Emirates, would have been a more appropriate choice ‚Äì sounds just a little unsavoury, it is very much in keeping with the bitter, ugly fall-out from Maradona's death that has taken place behind the moving public scenes of murals, grief and celebration. As reported by Infobae, Matias Morla, Diego's lawyer at the time of passing, moved immediately to trademark for himself the name and image of his former client, a gambit that for the past year has been disputed in the courts by the star's children, who contend that the businessman has been illicitly profiting from the rights. Injunctions, orders, lawsuits and counter-suits have been flying almost constantly between the two camps. Elsewhere in the courts, no fewer than seven health professionals who treated Maradona in his final days, including lead physician Leopoldo Luque, are being formally investigated on manslaughter charges related to alleged neglect and malpractice towards the ex-player prior to his death. Tuesday's trumped-up friendly might be a slightly more fitting stage than the Buenos Aires judicial system for an homage to Maradona, but it marks the continuation of a sad trend: the exploitation of the name of one of the greatest players ever to set foot on a football pitch, which started while he was still a young man ready to conquer the world and has only increased with his tragic passing.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-have-no-business-at-money-spinning-maradona/blt52e0b208fecf2429,Daniel Edwards,be3b288c-0d84-49a4-ba71-fc6590c632d5
Bundesliga referee praised after admitting Mainz goal should not have stood following botched VAR review,"Bundesliga referee Deniz Aytekin has been praised after admitting that Mainz's goal against Freiburg should not have stood following a botched VAR review. Mainz managed to stay in the hunt for European qualification by picking up a 1-1 draw at Schwarzwald-Stadion, while Freiburg missed the chance to move up to fourth. The hosts scored through Nils Petersen in the 69th minute to cancel out Alexander Hack's controversial first-half opener, which was given despite replays showing that he was offside. Hack bundled the ball home after latching onto a free-kick at the back post, but his celebrations were cut short as Aytekin and his refereeing team checked VAR for a possible handball. Replays showed that Hack did not handle the ball before prodding it into the net, but officials missed that he was quite clearly offside when the ball was initially headed into his path and the goal was allowed to stand. Aytekin admitted to his mistake after the game, telling reporters: ""It was offside and the goal shouldn't have counted. ""The video assistant had the focus on this handball. It slipped through... it's annoying but the goal shouldn't have counted."" The referee's comments were well received by Freiburg boss Christian Streich, who said he did the right thing by taking responsibility for the error. ""Mr Aytekin can't help it because he can't see it,"" he said. ""I think it's good that he just apologised and stood up for his colleagues, so to speak. That's how you do it."" Hack added on the controversial nature of his goal: ""You always think, it can't be that something like that happens, but you've made mistakes like that yourself and afterwards you can't explain why.  ""Logically, you think they'd check for offside. But because the hand was checked, they forgot that. That's how it is.""

Caf Confederation Cup: Ncikazi rues Orlando Pirates challenges ahead of final against RS Berkane,"Orlando Pirates co-coach Mandla Ncikazi insists the team will use the challenges faced to their advantage when they play RS Berkane in the Caf Confederation Cup final on Friday evening in Uyo, Nigeria. The South Africans arrived at the matchday venue on Thursday morning and needed to adjust fast ahead of the game. The final is set to be played just four days after Bucs played their second leg semi-final against Al Ahly Tripoli. ""The African game has its own dynamics we can‚Äôt change, you just have to adapt to sometimes, we are that team that you just have to go through challenges since we‚Äôve been involved in Caf, we‚Äôve always faced challenges,"" Ncikazi said ahead of the game. ""You go over that and just control what happens within the four lines, there we are in control and whatever happens outside we just put it aside."" ""Adversity is breakfast for champions, sometimes when things are proper, that‚Äôs when they are not proper, when we have challenges we use that to our advantage. ""For me when that happened, I took that as an advantage."" The 53-year-old has compared RS Berkane's game with what is played in Europe, but hinted at his game plan to stand a chance to win the match.

Ex-Arsenal star Ramsey 'itching to perform' for Rangers as Wales star eyes Europa League glory,"Rangers star Aaron Ramsey has revealed he hopes he can kick on and go on a run of good form as the season enters its most pivotal stage. The former Arsenal star moved to Scotland in January after he was deemed surplus by Juventus and has slowly but surely gotten minutes under his belt. Rangers currently sit three points behind league leaders and arch-rivals Celtic, with the drama of the season heading down to the wire. Speaking to Sky Sports, Ramsey said: ""It's been great. There's a great group of lads here who have made me feel very welcome and I'm just itching to get out there now and show what I can do. ""I've played a couple of games since coming here but hopefully now I can kick on and really contribute towards what's going to be the business end of the season. ""I'm happy to be a part of this and looking forward to the rest of the season. Hopefully now I get more of an opportunity. I'm feeling good. In the last game [against Dundee in the Scottish Cup]. I felt really good so hopefully I can build on that now and contribute. ""I always back myself and I know my quality - that's never going to be in doubt with me."" Ramsey's season has massively been disrupted by injuries, failing to make anything over 300 minutes in total, including his time at Juventus. So far he's made five appearances for Rangers, with two coming in the Scottish Cup, two in the league, and one in the Europa League. Despite his few minutes, he has managed to grab an assist and will be looking to get back to his best to help Rangers' title challenge.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ex-arsenal-star-ramsey-itching-to-perform-for-rangers-as/bltb0bf03254d72aae6,Marwan Harraz,42c4cebb-14a1-403b-94cb-48752ca96cbe

Laporta wary of financial cost of Barcelona signing Haaland amid reports Man City are now favourites for Dortmund striker,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta says he will not risk putting the club in financial danger to sign Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. The Camp Nou side are one of the top candidates to sign the striker, but face competition from Manchester City and Spanish rivals Real Madrid. Barca, however, are still recovering from a dire financial situation which saw club hero Lionel Messi depart last year. Although their situation is improving, Laporta is concerned about spending big on new signings. Asked about the club's chances of signing the Norway international, Laporta told TV3 on Sunday: ""We're working on the future of the squad. Both [director of football] Mateu Alemany and [advisor] Jordi Cruyff are also looking for a certain rationality. ""We are here to manage a football club well. We are in a period that, although we are improving economically, it has not yet been solved.  ""The economic situation has not been reversed and that is the priority.  ""It is clear that we want an increasingly powerful team. We will go all out, but we will not do any operation that puts the institution at risk."" It was reported this week that Manchester City have become the favourites to land the 21-year-old. Haaland has a reported ¬£63 million ($82m) release clause in his contract that can be activated at the end of the season.  The Daily Mail claims City will spend around ¬£100m ($130m) in total to get the attacker, including the release clause plus agent fees for Mino Raiola. The Premier League side are said to have discussed personal terms with Haaland and are confident of getting a deal done. The Times reported that City sporting director Txiki Begiristain and chief of football operations Omar Berrada met with the Dortmund star's representatives in Monaco to talk about a move.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/laporta-financial-cost-barcelona-signing-haaland-man-city/bltb98a7deff43b87f1,By Peter McVitie,dd0da024-b10c-4ab7-b732-7788fc09f591
Man Utd forward Greenwood remains on bail over rape & assault allegations as police release new statement,"Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood, who stands accused of rape and assault, has seen his bail extended. It was announced in April that an extension to the 20-year-old‚Äôs bail had been requested. Greenwood remains under police investigation following his arrest on January 30, with allegations of sexual assault and threats to kill made against him. The latest update from a Greater Manchester Police spokesperson is: ‚ÄúFollowing a hearing yesterday (Thursday 23 June 2022), a 20-year-old man arrested on suspicion of rape, assault and making threats to kill on Sunday 30 January 2022 remains on bail.  ‚ÄúAs the outcome of bail reviews does not impact the progression of investigations, Greater Manchester Police will not be providing any further updates in relation to this case until the suspect is charged or released facing no further action.‚Äù Greenwood, who spent three nights in police custody following his arrest, has been suspended indefinitely by his Premier League employers. United said in their last update back in April: ‚ÄúThere has been no change whatsoever in Mason‚Äôs status. ‚ÄúWe removed his profile from the club app soon after he was removed from the squad in January. This was in order to remove Mason from interactive elements of the app, such as team predictions. ‚ÄúHowever, his profile was never removed from the website as he remains a Manchester United player, albeit not currently part of the squad, while the legal process unfolds.‚Äù As well as being suspended at Old Trafford, Greenwood has also seen Nike cancel all commercial partnerships with him.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-forward-greenwood-remains-on-bail-rape-assault/blte66753d6870090d2,Chris Burton,e3023e92-16fb-4a35-8e70-5ff28eb8d7c6
'It's my mum's dream!' - New England call-up Mitchell prepares for international debut,"Crystal Palace full-back Tyrick Mitchell says a dream has come true for his mum after he received his first England call up. England announced on Monday that the 22-year-old was among the four players drafted in to the squad after several were ruled out through injury ahead of the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast.  Mitchell did not represent England at any age level on his way to the senior game and was surprised to be called into the team so soon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dream come true. I never, ever thought it would happen so quickly, so I‚Äôm literally over the moon,"" he told Palace TV. ""I found out [Saturday]. I got the text. I couldn‚Äôt believe it, I was just lost for words.‚Äù Asked if he had shared the news with his mum, Mitchell said: ""I didn't even tell her. I was waiting for it to get announced. That's one of her dreams, to see me play at Wembley. ""Wembley is so close to home so to be called up for England and be around it and be in Wembley Stadium is literally a dream come true itself."" The left-back made his senior debut in April 2020 and has made 33 appearances in all competitions for the club this season. He has started all 29 of Palace's Premier League matches so far, failing to finish the full 90 minutes on just one occasion. ""I think my team-mates, the manager, everything about Palace has pushed me to understand that last year I did well, but this year I know what I‚Äôm capable of and I‚Äôm just trying to show it,"" he said. ‚ÄúThis season has been amazing.

Mane eclipses Salah again as Liverpool pair endure mixed World Cup fortunes,"Senegal‚Äôs World Cup qualifying playoff against Egypt was billed both as a rematch of the pair‚Äôs Africa Cup of Nations final last month, and a meeting between Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. One of the Anfield pair‚Äîarguably Africa‚Äôs two best players‚Äîwere going to miss out on the global showpiece, and ultimately, it‚Äôs Salah who will have to sit out Qatar after Senegal‚Äôs penalty shootout victory in Dakar. The Merseyside two endured mixed fortunes in Tuesday‚Äôs second leg, with Salah stepping up to take Egypt‚Äôs first penalty‚Äîonly to blaze it over the crossbar‚Äîbefore Mane converted Senegal‚Äôs final spotkick. Mane‚Äôs successful effort was a repeat of the Nations Cup final, as the forward stepped up to fire home the Teranga Lions‚Äô decisive fifth kick‚Äîsecuring their first ever continental crown. Mohamed Salah will turn 34 during the 2026 World Cup, his next opportunity to play at the tournament.Will this be the final, defining image of the Liverpool superstar's attempts to truly make his mark on the grandest stage of all?#SENEGY #WCQ2022 #LFC #YNWA pic.twitter.com/rpuQqBEoWr Salah had faced criticism for not stepping up during the Afcon final, with the attacker scheduled for Egypt‚Äôs fifth penalty, but the shootout had already been decided before it was his turn to face Edouard Mendy. This time, he stepped up first for the North Africans‚Äîemulating Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly by taking responsibility‚Äîbut both skippers missed their opening kicks; the Napoli man slamming his against the crossbar and Salah firing over the bar. There were mitigating circumstances, with the home fans shining lasers in the eyes of the visiting Egypt players throughout the contest, particularly targeting Mohamed El Shenawy as they sought to destabilise the Pharaohs stopper. The green lights shone from the crowd appeared to be localised entirely on Salah‚Äôs face when he stepped up for his spotkick, although it remains to be seen whether the forward will blame the supporters‚Äô intervention for his missed effort. As well as the pressure of the occasion, the lasers surely had an impact on Egypt‚Äôs miserable shootout‚Äîas they scored just one of four attempted spotkicks, with Ahmed Sayed Zizo and Mostafa Mohamed both missing from the spot. So, for the second time in the space of two months, it‚Äôs Mane who eclipses Salah in a potentially career-defining fixture, with the Senegal superstar now adding a ticket to Qatar to the African title he won last month. It‚Äôs a great irony that a season that started so strongly for Salah at club level‚Äîhe also eclipsed Didier Drogba to become Africa‚Äôs all-time top scorer in the Premier League‚Äîis morphing into a campaign of such personal disappointment. Of course, he could still win major silverware with Liverpool this term, but Egypt‚Äôs failures over the last four weeks will certainly count against him when the continent‚Äôs all-time greats are being assessed and evaluated years from now. What will it do for his Ballon d'Or prospects? Despite a fine performance against Morocco‚Äîand a somewhat generous inclusion in Caf‚Äôs Team of the Tournament‚ÄîSalah was far from his best at the Nations Cup, where he struggled to ignite an Egypt side that owed much of their run to the final to a rugged and resilient defensive display. He doesn‚Äôt appear to have the guile and invention to lift those around him when the Pharaohs are struggling to impose themselves on opponents‚Äîtestament to his specific skillset rather than his overall quality‚Äîand certainly doesn‚Äôt have the quality of international teammates around him that Mane does. Now 29, and firmly in his prime, 2022 was surely the year when peak Salah had the opportunity to truly write his legacy at international level and replicate his Liverpool achievements for the Pharaohs. He‚Äôs already done immense things with the national side‚Äîinspiring them to the 2018 World Cup and reaching two Afcon finals‚Äîbut in both of those areas, he‚Äôs now been eclipsed by Mane, a player who has so often been in his shadow at club level. Similarly, while Mane will likely have the opportunity to take on a World Cup in his prime, we‚Äôll now never see peak Salah testing himself on the grandest stage of all; the forward failed to qualify in 2014, when he was still finding his way in the game, and injury infamously overshadowed his contribution in 2018. Salah will now have to watch the World Cup on television, while Mane leads this fine Senegal team‚ÄîAfrican champions no less‚Äîon the global high table. He‚Äôll turn 34 during the 2026 World Cup, and who knows what the state of his fitness, his speed, his teammates, his form will be come the global showpiece in Canada, Mexico and the United States will be. Senegal and Mane are deserving of their progress to Qatar, and their place at the World Cup, but there‚Äôs no doubt that we‚Äôve missed out on the final opportunity to see Salah‚Äîarguably the finest African player on the planet‚Äîfeature on the grandest stage of all, fit and unencumbered, in his prime.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-eclipses-salah-again-as-liverpool-pair-endure-mixed/bltcec923fde26aff1b,Ed Dove,06299d0f-c25b-4302-afc6-92e31eb95a41
Pochettino's relationship with PSG nearing breaking point as Man Utd target ex-Spurs boss,"GOAL can confirm that Mauricio Pochettino's relationship with Paris Saint-Germain is nearing breaking point, while Manchester United have targeted the former Tottenham boss as their potential next permanent manager. Pochettino replaced Thomas Tuchel at Parc des Princes in January 2021, after over a year out of coaching following his sacking at Spurs, and has since guided the club to two domestic trophies. PSG have also risen to the top of the Ligue 1 standings in the Argentine's first full season in charge, 16 points clear of second-place Marseille, but his credentials have still been called into question amid a run of unconvincing performances. PSG suffered a surprise round of 16 Coupe de France exit at the hands of Nice last month that piled extra pressure on Pochettino, who is not completely happy at the club and could walk away from his post at the end of the season. The 49-year-old's relationship with the board and sporting director Leonardo became strained after he was not given the chance to clear out a number of first-team players last summer, leaving him with an overstuffed squad of 30 players. GOAL understands that PSG officials also denied his request to sign Tanguy Ndombele from Spurs in January and the club have already identified Zinedine Zidane as his potential replacement as their relationship continues to deteriorate - albeit with former Real Madrid boss currently uninterested in the job. If Pochettino does leave PSG he is eager to move straight into another head coaching position, and a spot in the Old Trafford dugout could be waiting for him. GOAL can confirm that the Parc des Princes tactician is still one of United's preferred candidates to succeed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as their permanent head coach in the summer - at which point interim boss Ralf Rangnick is due to move into an advisor role. However, Pochettino's departure from PSG could yet be hastened, with the board likely to make a change in leadership if he cannot mastermind a win over Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League. The Coupe de France elimination shook their faith in Pochettino and he will need to earn a positive result in the first leg of their European tie with the Blancos in Paris on Tuesday to get back in their good graces.

Aubameyang delighted to have adapted quickly to life at Barcelona,"Barcelona star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang already feels at home at Barcelona, but affirmed that he did not expect to have any problems adapting to Camp Nou.  The Gabon international was allowed to leave on a free by Arsenal in January after being stripped of the captaincy in north London.  He has made a rapid impact at Barca, with his arrival coinciding with an upturn in the club's fortunes over the past two months.  ""I was expecting [to adapt] a bit because I've worked hard and wanted to do well right from the start,"" Aubameyang explained to reporters on Wednesday.  ""I am happy with what I am doing. With the help of my team-mates it is easier and also with a team of such talent.  Aubameyang has scored an impressive five goals in six lA Liga matches since moving to Barca, including a hat-trick to take down Valencia.  The Catalans won five of those matches and drew to rocket up the table into the Champions League spots after a tough start to the season, though they still trail leaders Real Madrid by 15 points.  Their best hope of silverware this season may be in the Europa League, where on Thursday they meet Galatasaray in the last 16 after drawing 0-0 in the first leg.  ""I think tomorrow's game is key and we are prepared to come to win here,"" he added.  ""Galatasaray's defence did well in the first game and we know what we have to do tomorrow to win.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aubameyang-delighted-to-have-adapted-quickly-to-life-at/bltfeacb127fa42949c,Daniel Edwards,a1ea2960-fcf2-4bbd-9898-3d454c723cf3
"Championship winner odds: Favourites, contenders & outsiders to earn promotion in 2021-22 ","With the 2021-22 Championship campaign drawing to a close, the race to secure promotion into the Premier League is very much in full swing Fulham and Bournemouth have already booked their tickets back to the big time, leaving it to the likes of Nottingham Forest and Huddersfield to battle it out for one remaining spot in the top-flight. GOAL has all you need to know about the favourites to step out of the second tier, with the race very much on to start rubbing shoulders with English football's elite in 2022-23. Having spent two of their last three seasons in the Premier League, Fulham will be back for more next term after claiming this year's Championship title. Marco Silva inherited a squad that boasts a number of players that represented the Cottagers in the Premier League last season, and that top-flight calibre - along with a few notable additions - allowed them to start pulling clear of their fellow frontrunners. Despite having not lifted the second tier trophy since 2001, the 2018 and 2020 play-off winners are bouncing back up as champions this time around. After last season's heart-breaking play-off semi-final defeat to Brentford, Bournemouth have made absolutely sure this term by securing automatic promotion. Having left Fulham to move to the Vitality Stadium in the summer of 2021, Cherries boss Scott Parker has his current charges heading back to the top-flight alongside his previous employers from west London. Nottingham Forest remain the value bet heading into the second legs of crucial play-off semi-final contests, with the Reds priced at 4/6 (1.67) for promotion as Steve Cooper seeks to wake a sleeping giant of English football from the deepest of slumbers. The former Swansea City boss has made a remarkable impact at the City Ground since succeeding Chris Hughton and has the Reds looking to return to the top-flight for the first time in the 21st century. Luton Town have exceeded all expectations in 2021-22, with Nathan Jones being crowned Championship Manager of the Season as a result, but they are 6/1 (7.0) to complete a remarkable rise that has - across eight memorable years - lifted them from non-league football to within touching distance of the Premier League. The Hatters' play-off foes, Huddersfield Town, are 3/1 (4.0) to make their way to Wembley and get over the line at the home of English football. The Terriers know what it takes to get that job done having secured promotion down that path as recently as 2016-17. Sheffield United are attempting to yo-yo into the Premier League at the first time of asking, but they have slipped to 7/1 (8.0) after coming unstuck on home soil in the first leg of their semi-final showdown with Forest. The Blades have it all to do at the City Ground, but a late effort at Bramall Lane in a 2-1 defeat means that they still have hope to cling to.

'I have not enough space to think' - Klopp raises fixture concerns again following Arteta complaints,"Jurgen Klopp has raised concerns once more over Liverpool's fixture crunch as the Reds continue to mount their pursuit of a potential quadruple this season. Liverpool travel to Nottingham Forest in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Sunday, in the first of what could be many games left this season. Ahead of his team's trip to City Ground, Klopp has spoken about his frustrations surrounding the schedule, suggesting that successful teams are punished for their progression on multiple fronts. ""The only way I can do is really be focused on the next game, I just have not enough space to think about different stuff [quadruple] and I don't have to,"" the German said. ""I have no idea where you want to fit them all in. ""To be honest, I don't know. What, it's May 22, and a week later it would be the Champions League final. The FA Cup final would be the week before the Champions League final. No, the week before the season final. ""So it means that game must be rearranged as well. The calendar is not made for a lot of success for the same team, maybe fair. So because at one point you have to make [a decision], or we focus on that, or we focus on that or whatever."" Klopp is far from the only manager to raise questions over the schedule, with Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta also complaining about the fixture list. Tottenham boss Antonio Conte however hit back at Arteta, with a pointed reminder of the north London derby postponement. With the Reds still in contention on three different fronts, Klopp's side could face up to 17 fixtures before the end of May, starting with Sunday's FA Cup clash against Forest. They will play a guaranteed dozen fixtures at least across the rest of the season, including nine Premier League games and their double-legged Champions League tie against Benfica next month. That will grow by a further five however if they reach the finals of both knockout tournaments they remain in, leading to a heavily condensed schedule over the next two-and-a-half months.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klopp-fixture-concerns-arteta-complaints/blt133a774960110f4a,Andrew Steel,ecc10275-01ec-4b04-9dca-d8f656a43c98
'The sky is the limit for Konate' - Liverpool defender's Champions League final display left Alexander-Arnold 'lost for words',"Trent Alexander-Arnold says that his Liverpool team-mate Ibrahima Konate has ""ridiculous"" potential. The 23-year-old has stood out in the heart of the Reds defence since he made the ¬£36 million ($46m) move from RB Leipzig last year. Konate made just 11 Premier League appearances this season as Jurgen Klopp stuck with the centre-back pairing of Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk, but the Frenchman played a key role in his team's journey to the Champions League final as he featured in a total of eight games. Despite their 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid, Konate put in a solid performance for Liverpool in the final in Paris. His display impressed Alexander-Arnold, who was full of praise for his Anfield colleague.  ""Wow. Outstanding. The performance he put in yesterday, I‚Äôm lost for words. Words can‚Äôt do it justice,"" he said to the club website as the Reds celebrated their season with an open-top bus parade through the streets of Liverpool. ""We‚Äôve created a bond & he‚Äôs an amazing lad. The potential he has is ridiculous. The sky is the limit."" The Reds enjoyed a fine season despite missing out on the Champions League and Premier League titles. Konate was also a constant presence in their FA Cup triumph, playing every minute of their campaign, while he was a big part of their Carabao Cup success, too. With four years left on his contract, he will be hoping to secure a place in the starting XI in the Premier League next term as Klopp's men will be out to improve on their 2021-22 campaign.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-sky-is-the-limit-konate-liverpool-defender-champions/blt7ce0cd31c8ecee57,Peter McVitie,846d70eb-e6fa-4ba4-bbf2-323aa10fb8e0
Everton's nemesis: Derby-day specialist Origi keeps Liverpool's quadruple dreams on track,"Match statistics: Liverpool 2-0 Everton It just had to be him, didn‚Äôt it? When you need a hero on derby day, what do you do? You send up the Bat Signal and you ask for the Big Belgian. There was an hour on the clock at Anfield when Jurgen Klopp turned to Divock Origi, and 30 minutes later he was hugging him like he has never hugged anyone before. No wonder. He is leaving Liverpool this summer, Origi, but he made sure he left something new for fans to remember him by. Brought on with the 240th Merseyside derby goalless, tense and scrappy and edgy and nervous, the 27-year-old did what he always does when faced with the men from Goodison Park. He hurt them. Badly. A message from Divock after another derby day goal üì≤ü§© pic.twitter.com/6YTJh7hCXk He had only been on the field two minutes when he combined with Mohamed Salah, allowing the Egyptian to cross for Andy Robertson to head in the most precious of goals.

A derby assist is one thing, but he specialises in derby goals, and five minutes from time he got his sixth, perfectly-placed to head home himself at the Kop End after Luis Diaz, another to make a huge impact off the bench, had gone for goal with an overhead kick. The smiles said it all, and not just Origi‚Äôs. His team-mates love him, and so do his supporters. Klopp most of all, perhaps, even if he cannot give him the football he would like to. üó£Ô∏è ""Where do you want your statue Divock Origi."" üëèOrigi adds another goal against Everton to his repertoire ‚úÖ‚úÖ pic.twitter.com/cS1s4XvC1v Impact subs.Divock Origi scores thanks to an acrobatic assist from Luis Diaz!

There were certainly signs of tension here, with Everton doing well to prey on that, niggling and chipping away, wasting time and challenging the home fans, and players, to keep their patience and concentration. Liverpool did, just, their fitness and their quality off the bench just too much. Diaz made a difference, Jordan Henderson too.

Tammy Abraham would be 'perfect' for Arsenal as Petit offers Arteta transfer advice,"Roma striker Tammy Abraham would be the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù signing for Arsenal, according to former Gunners midfielder Emmanuel Petit. Abraham has thrived in Serie A since joining from Chelsea in a ‚Ç¨40 million (¬£34m/$47m) deal last summer, scoring 23 goals in 41 appearances in all competitions. With Mikel Arteta expected to be in the market for a frontman at the end of the season, the Spaniard has been urged to consider a move for in-form England international. France World Cup winner Petit believes Abraham may be open to a return to the Premier League despite his success under Jose Mourinho in the Italian capital.  If that is the case then Petit thinks a move to Emirates Stadium would suit all parties, likening Abraham's attributes to former Gunners striker Emmanuel Adebayor. ‚ÄúAbraham reminds me of Emmanuel Adebayor, his physical presence in the penalty area,‚Äù he told Genting Casino. ‚ÄúAbraham‚Äôs reaction when he arrived at Roma has been brilliant because he‚Äôs scored 15 [league] goals and has so many assists, so he‚Äôs enjoying his football there. ‚ÄúHe went to Italy with the feeling of revenge for what happened at Chelsea. He‚Äôs not stupid, he will see what‚Äôs going on with the strikers at Chelsea with Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner, they‚Äôre struggling. So maybe he‚Äôs thinking, ‚Äòit would have been worse for me if I had stayed at Chelsea‚Äô. He made the right decision and he‚Äôs having a great season with Roma. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure he wants to come back to England and he would fit perfectly at Arsenal because he‚Äôs a different player to Alexandre Lacazette with a different style, different physique and he‚Äôs a goalscorer. Even at Chelsea he was scoring goals, not as many as he wanted, but he‚Äôs 24 years old so he still has a lot to learn.‚Äù Arsenal are likely to be on the hunt for a striker this summer after letting Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leave for Barcelona in January. Alexandre Lacazette has led the line since Aubameyang left, but the Frenchman has scored just six goals in 30 appearances this season. Therefore, a goalscorer is likely to be on Arteta‚Äôs summer wanted list, particularly if the club qualify for the Champions League. Abraham has given the Gunners encouragement by recently admitting he would be tempted by a move back to London, but Chelsea are also likely be interested. The west London club reportedly have a buyback option in the deal that took the 24-year-old to Italy nine months ago. Boss Thomas Tuchel may be tempted to activate that clause if Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner, who have just six Premier League goals between them so far this season, continue to underperform.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tammy-abraham-would-be-perfect-for-arsenal-as-petit-offers/blt02dd8f239b77927e,Tom Mallows,48a16ee5-765b-40c1-9d39-d3cd1bf3940e
Zinchenko fulfills 'boyhood dream' to follow in Henry and Fabregas footsteps with Arsenal transfer,"Oleksandr Zinchenko says joining Arsenal fulfills a ""boyhood dream"", with the Ukraine international admitting that he cannot wait to follow in the footsteps of Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas for the Gunners. The versatile squad man has made the leap to north London from Manchester City, reunited with former assistant boss Mikel Arteta and becoming the second ex-Citizens player to make the trip south in recent weeks, following Gabriel Jesus. For Zinchenko, a fan of the club as a youngster, the move represents more than just the next step in his career however - and he cannot wait to get started. ""I would like to say this is a boyhood dream come true, because I was a massive fan when I was a kid,"" Zinchenko told Arsenal's official website upon completion of his capture. ""[When] Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas [were] playing here, I was just enjoying watching those games, that Arsenal. Obviously I started to love this club, so I am so excited and I cannot wait to play. ""It‚Äôs unbelievable, honestly, like I said, it‚Äôs a dream come true and since I was a kid I couldn‚Äôt even dream about it, but now it‚Äôs time, so I‚Äôm so happy."" The transfer naturally reunites the Ukrainian with his former assistant manager at City, but also with the Brazilian forward who he has followed from the Etihad Stadium this summer, with Zinchenko citing his bond with both as key factors. ""I would say it‚Äôs the most important role in my decision,"" the Ukrainian added on Arteta. ""Since the first day at City I knew that he‚Äôs going to be a very good manager. The way he can see football, especially I was watching the last season of Arsenal‚Äôs games and I was really enjoying it. You can see in the style, the picture of the game, so I would love to see it (while) playing and being involved. As for Jesus, Zinchenko heaped further praise, adding: ""He‚Äôs my big friend and I would like to say he was also involved in the discussions and all these things, so he‚Äôs told me a lot of good things about this amazing club and about this atmosphere, and the guys and everyone here, so I‚Äôm really impressed and so excited.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zinchenko-fulfills-boyhood-dream-to-follow-in-henry-and-fabregas-/blt8a4aa2a45e5d4b7f,Andrew Steel,551d1209-4727-4cdc-81ce-3338215c037b
"Wan-Bissaka and Shaw out, Dalot and Telles in? Man Utd's misfiring full-backs facing fight to impress Rangnick","Ralf Rangnick‚Äôs first game as Manchester United's interim manager could - given the circumstances - barely have gone better. The German coach only managed one 45-minute training session with his players after meeting them for the first time on Friday, but Sunday's win over Crystal Palace provided clear signs that his ideas and philosophy were already being understood by the United squad. The control that Rangnick had called for was there throughout as the Red Devils kept their first home clean sheet since April, while the high-press that many promised would accompany his arrival was evident, albeit not for the whole 90 minutes. Having mostly played a 4-2-3-1 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Rangnick opted for a 4-2-2-2 formation, leading to a debate regarding which players will thrive and which will struggle in the new system. For ex-United star Rio Ferdinand, two names stand out when it comes to the latter. ""I've got to be honest, [Aaron] Wan-Bissaka has got a hell of a job getting back in this team. The same for Luke Shaw,‚Äù Ferdinand said on his 5ive podcast. ""They've both got one hell of a job. ""One thing this manager likes is full-backs who can actually play and get on the ball."" Rangnick's system requires his full-backs to push forward and provide the attacking threat from wide areas, especially when his attacking midfielders (on Sunday that was Bruno Fernandes and Jadon Sancho) come inside to link the play. Such tactics, of course, are not revolutionary, with modern full-backs expected to contribute to their side‚Äôs attacking play, but it is something that has not been as important at United in the past few years due to the formation they largely played under Solskjaer.¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not been asked to venture forward much earlier in his career,‚Äù the Norweigian said of Wan-Bissaka earlier this year. ‚ÄúAaron has the time ahead of him and we‚Äôll give him time. In a year or two, you‚Äôll see a top, top full-back.‚Äù Rangnick, however, does not have the time to wait, and though Wan-Bissaka is one of the best defensive full-backs in the Premier League - especially when faced with one-on-one situations - he struggles when tasked with delivering crosses into the penalty area. One player who does have that attacking skillset, though, is the man who could be about to replace Wan-Bissaka long-term: Diogo Dalot. The Portugal international has started back to back Premier League games for the first time since April 2019, and if he does not retain his place in the line-up against Young Boys on Wednesday, then that will be because he is being rested for what is a meaningless game, rather than dropped after two impressive displays. Dalot played well when he replaced the injured Wan-Bissaka against Arsenal, but was even better against Palace. His best moment came midway through the first half as he delivered a perfect cross into the box looking for the head of Cristiano Ronaldo. Though it did not result in a United goal, it was the sort of delivery that Wan-Bissaka does not have in his locker, and another ball into the box in the second half eventually led to Fred's long-range winner.¬† Those close to Dalot have felt for some time that he is better going forward than Wan-Bissaka, but within the United dressing room the belief was that Solskjaer would not rotate from his favourite players, no matter their level of performance. The Norwegian had players he preferred, and consequently Dalot, who had offers to go out on loan again in the summer after his successful spell at AC Milan in 2020-21, was limited to just two starts this season before Solskjaer‚Äôs sacking.¬† Rangnick is now starting from scratch, and given Dalot's raw statistics - he averages more passes in the final third, more final third entries and more crosses than Wan-Bissaka per 90 minutes - he could well be the regular starting right-back going forward. That would be vindication for Dalot, who has always vowed to fight for his place at Old Trafford. It will put pay to any potential loan move in January (Jose Mourinho's Roma are one of the clubs interested in such a deal), but the coming weeks and months present the 22-year-old with a chance to finally nail down a position in the United team in what is his fourth season at Old Trafford. ""There's no secret that it's difficult when you don‚Äôt play as much as you wanted,‚Äù Dalot said this week.¬†‚ÄúBut it's our job to get ready, and I've been doing that for a couple months now, especially this season, being ready when my time comes to give everything on the pitch. ""Help the team, that's most important thing, and I'm very happy to have this momentum and be out there with the team."" Over on the left, Shaw certainly has more of a chance of keeping his place under Rangnick, though Alex Telles has impressed in the England international's absence this past week and too has the attacking instincts to be effective in United's new system. After a superb season last term, Shaw endured a shaky start to the new campaign, and those struggles, coupled with Telles' form, could mean he too faces a spell on the sidelines if he cannot prove himself on the training pitch. Gone, then, are the days of Solskjaer playing favourites at Manchester United. Rangnick is in charge now, and his idea of the ideal full-back could be about to give new leases of life to two forgotten men of the previous regime.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wan-bissaka-shaw-dalot-telles-man-utd-full-backs-rangnick/blt7a8fb8dce597739f,Charlotte Duncker,47ba122f-bfdc-4cf7-ab5b-8d329da1d5aa
Not so fast! Lyon show new rival Barcelona they are still Europe's best in runaway Women's Champions League final win,"How many times have fans at a women‚Äôs football match needed to be escorted past rival supporters by the police? It‚Äôs a rarity, that‚Äôs for sure, but it was the case on Saturday evening in Turin, one of the most striking images outside the home of Juventus as Barcelona and Lyon prepared to do battle in the Women‚Äôs Champions League final. Barcelona were fuelled by their defeat to the French giants in the 2019 final, a 4-1 hammering that showed the Catalans the level they needed to reach in order to be European champions ‚Äì a feat they finally achieved last May. But there would be no revenge here. Instead, it was a statement made by the now eight-time winners of this competition that their continental failure last year was merely a blip.  After a blistering start that included three strikes in the opening 33 minutes, Lyon emerged 3-1 winners in Italy and regained their status atop Europe. LYON BEAT BARCELONA TO WIN THE WOMEN‚ÄôS CHAMPIONS LEAGUE üá´üá∑üèÜ pic.twitter.com/VA602WramS However, Barcelona's strength cannot be dismissed on the back of a single outing.  On the night, yes, they were not as good as Lyon. The blueprint to beat the Blaugrana was exposed: you press them high, you make them panic and you take your chances. But it must be remembered that they enjoyed a near-perfect season in all competitions. This felt like the birth of a new rivalry, a back-and-forth set to unfold in the years to come rather than a powerhouse putting an upstart in its place. It was evident in the build-up to this game that there was a chip on Lyon‚Äôs shoulders. The plaudits Barcelona had won in the last 12 months have seemingly overshadowed the achievements of the French side, which have been and will be unmatched. ""There was women's football before Barcelona, and it was played here for years,‚Äù Lyon forward Ada Hegerberg told L‚ÄôEquipe earlier this month.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to forget that,‚Äù midfielder Damaris Egurrola added, speaking to GOAL. In the press conference before the game, captain Wendie Renard took exception to the idea that Barcelona were the favourites in Turin.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the journalists that say we are outsiders,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a final with two teams doing exceptionally well. For me, a final is 50-50. There is no favourite. There is no underdog.‚Äù Lyon win their eighth Women's Champions League title üèÜ pic.twitter.com/V4A2Xyn3eh There was the utmost respect between both sets of players going into the game, there is no doubt about that. But it‚Äôs no surprise that such a build-up created real spice in it. It wasn‚Äôt just the comments made, or the media‚Äôs words, but the presence of the fans, both sets so passionate and unwavering in their support for each side, too. Barcelona fans flooded Turin on Saturday, taking over entire streets with banners, drums and song. Lyon‚Äôs fans may have been outnumbered in size, but they made up for the numbers in voice, waving Norway flags in their corner of the crowd as an ode to Hegerberg, the talismanic figure who acted as conductor at times. As the Lyon goalkeepers came out for the warm-up, they were jeered as if the game was being played in Barcelona. When the teams were read out, it was the same. That atmosphere lay the foundation for what happened on the pitch. With the referee letting a lot of possible fouls go, it was an incredibly physical game with plenty of bite. After Lyon had raced into a 3-0 lead ‚Äì thanks to Amandine Henry‚Äôs wonder-strike, Hegerberg‚Äôs back post header and Catarina Macario‚Äôs close-range finish ‚Äì Alexia Putellas scored a superb goal to get Barcelona back in the game before half time. As soon as the ball had hit the back of the net, the Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner was there to pick it up and run back to her own half, ready for kick-off. Before that though, she tossed the ball in the direction of Hegerberg, stood in the centre circle. ""Game on,"" the gesture suggested. Unfortunately for Barcelona, it wouldn‚Äôt be anything more than a consolation. They tried and tried to get another back ‚Äì Patri Guijarro incredibly hitting the bar from halfway line ‚Äì and the desire was evident in every moment on the pitch. When Griedge Mbock Bathy went down with an injury in the second half, Claudia Pina tried to get her off the ground and, when she did get up, Putellas picked up the bag of the medical team and moved it off the pitch. Moments before, Christiane Endler had pushed away Asisat Oshoala for closing her down more than she would‚Äôve liked. It was a constant theme throughout the game but, once all was said and done, a baseline of respect remained in place. When the final whistle went, Putellas laid on the ground by the penalty spot, in the box nearest the thousands of Barcelona fans. Player after player went to console her, followed by staff member after staff member. It took a few minutes until she would pick herself up. When she did, over walked Hegerberg, one Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner approaching another. She offered an embrace and a word in her ear. It was a moment which showed that while there is a rivalry out there, it is a rivalry built on respect. These are two exceptional teams and they help to push one another. For years, it was Wolfsburg that were Lyon‚Äôs biggest rival. It‚Äôs clear that now, it will be Barcelona. A picture that's worth 1000 words üòî pic.twitter.com/v6HlLKyp5x ‚ÄúThe memory of the 2019 final is bitter,‚Äù Putellas said this week. ‚ÄúIt was a painful final. Our first final ended in the worst possible way. ‚ÄúIt was very painful in the short term but in the long term I think it was good in some ways, because it showed us where we were as a team in terms of the level we needed to become European champions.‚Äù She and Barcelona came back from that and they will come back from this. When they do, it will continue the start of this incredible new battle among two of Europe‚Äôs most incredible sides. For now, though, the title of most incredible belongs to Lyon for a record eighth time - and it‚Äôs going to take something quite sensational to take it from them.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lyon-barcelona-womens-champions-league-final-rival/blt44ff2b2697c058b3,Ame√© Ruszkai,a70abe16-a087-4fd1-bfe1-a8bd5ca0157b
Mendy lauded by Tuchel for keeping Chelsea in FA Cup final against Liverpool,"Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has lauded his custodian Edouard Mendy for his ""excellent goalkeeping"" in their FA Cup final loss to Liverpool on Saturday at Wembley Stadium. After a goalless draw in 120 minutes, the Merseyside outfit won the ensuing penalty shootout 6-5 to bag their eighth FA Cup title at the expense of their London-based opponents. The Blues had a poor start and struggled to contain Jurgen Klopp's side, especially in the first quarter of the game. ""It was clear that in some moments we would suffer and unfortunately we did in the first 15 minutes,"" Tuchel said as quoted by the club's website. ""We looked nervous and tense. We also played with one less day in recovery. We had an away game against Leeds on Wednesday and played again 120 minutes today but it was clear we would suffer against this team during minutes. ""We managed to stay in the match, clearly because of an excellent goalkeeping performance from Edou [Mendy]. We dug in and got better and better, more confident and we found solutions and created chances ourselves. Everybody is in pain, there is no way you escape this game without pain."" It was the second time Chelsea faced Liverpool in a final this season after meeting in the League Cup where the Reds, once again, triumphed in a shootout after a goalless 120 minutes. ""Like in the last final in the Carabao Cup, again we have no regrets,"" Tuchel continued. ""I told the team that I‚Äôm proud. I was happy to arrive with this group and we were sure we would be competitive and make life very difficult for Liverpool. ""We struggled in the first 15 minutes and then we were excellent through the whole match, 240 minutes of final time and played 0-0 against maybe the most dangerous attacking team in the world. ""We created a lot of chances and we deserved it, as they deserved it as well, and again we lost on penalties so we‚Äôre disappointed and sad of course but at the same time proud because we left everything that you need.""

"Liverpool‚Äôs Mane a great shout to win Ballon d‚ÄôOr, with Salah the other standout ‚Äì Crouch","Former Liverpool striker Peter Crouch believes Sadio Mane could be the next winner of the Ballon d‚ÄôOr and will be a contender together with Mohamed Salah, if the Reds finish the season on a high. The 30-year-old Mane is having a great season, first helping Senegal to lift their maiden Africa Cup of Nations title after defeating Egypt in the final and later returning to Anfield to help the Reds beat Chelsea and clinch the League Cup. On top of that, Mane has so far contributed 20 goals and three assists for Liverpool in all competitions. According to 41-year-old Crouch, who played for the Reds between 2005 and 2008 and scored 22 goals from 85 appearances, the former Southampton player will be a deserved winner if he goes ahead to claim a quadruple. ‚ÄúMane‚Äôs a great shout,‚Äù the former England striker told Paddy Power as quoted by Mirror. He‚Äôs won the Afcon already, and if he goes on to win the Champions League, the Premier League and if Liverpool completes the quadruple then it would almost certainly have to go to a Liverpool player, and then [Mohamed] Salah and Mane are your standouts for it.‚Äù In a recent interview, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp did not rule out Mane as a contender for the 2022 Ballon d‚ÄôOr. ‚ÄúIf you are not [Leo] Messi or Ronaldo you have to win probably the Champions League, which we didn't do yet so give us a few more weeks and then we will see where we end up.‚Äù ‚Äú[Mane] can play left, he can play central, both positions world-class,‚Äù Klopp said ahead of their Champions League clash against Villarreal. ‚ÄúHe started for us here at Liverpool on the right-wing. Some people in the room will remember his goal at Arsenal when it was his first goal when he cut inside and fired the ball with his left foot into the far corner. Absolutely outstanding, love it. ‚ÄúThere are different ways that Sadio plays and sometimes we want him to drop slightly more, but today we wanted him to stay even more between the centre-halves, keep them away and offer the runs in behind.

"La Liga odds: Real Madrid, Barcelona & the top teams‚Äô chances of winning in 2021-22","Real Madrid have only won La Liga three times in the last 10 years, but Carlo Ancelotti's men are in pole position to reclaim the crown from cross-city rival Atletico Madrid.  Los Blancos have shown themselves to be extremely tough to beat this season and have ground out results in performances reminiscent of title-winning sides. However, the battle to be crowned champions of Spain is far from over as Real Madrid will know themselves, having last season clawed back a 10-point deficit against Atletico Madrid to take the title race down to the final day of the campaign. GOAL brings you everything you need to know about the favourites and outsiders for the La Liga title in 2021-22. Ending 2021 eight points clear at the top of the Liga table underlines just how strong Real Madrid have been this season. Los Blancos are the division's top scorers and boast the most prolific marksman in the league in Karim Benzema.  The Frenchman's partnership with Vinicius Junior has gone a long way to ensuring top spot for Madrid and the side from the Spanish capital are offered at just 1/8 with bet365 to claim their 35th league title.  A major factor in Real Madrid's favour is the current state of their two most traditional rivals, with Atletico Madrid ending the year 17 points behind them and Barcelona a further point away.  It is Sevilla who are currently posing the biggest threat to Los Blancos, and Julen Lopetegui's men can be backed at 9/1.  Atletico Madrid come next in the betting at 20/1, while Barcelona are priced at 40/1 to produce what would arguably be the greatest comeback in La Liga history given the institutional crisis which the club has been enduring.  Fighting for the title is likely to be beyond this talented yet extremely young and inexperienced Barcelona squad.  The Blaugrana will be more focussed on finishing in the top four, something that it is an economic imperative given the club's precarious financial position, but also the bare minimum requirement from the fans.  Should youngsters Nico Gonzalez and Gavi continue to flourish, and Ansu Fati return from injury in strong scoring form, there is every chance that Xavi Hernandez will be able to secure at least a Champions League spot for his side next season.  Six-time champions of the Europa League and winners of the Copa Del Rey in 2007 and 2010, Sevilla have only ever been Spanish champions on one occasion.  The side from Andalusia's only title win came back in the 1945-46 season, although they ran Real Madrid close in the 2007-08 campaign before ultimately slipping to third place in the table.  With Atletico Madrid and Barcelona struggling, Sevilla may never get a better chance to mount a serious title challenge.  Atletico Madrid finished two points clear of Real Madrid last year to claim their 11th league title and their second under Diego Simeone.  With the return of Antoine Griezmann to the club in the summer, Atletico were expected to mount a serious defence of their title yet so far Simeone's side have been underwhelming.

Lionel Messi‚Äôs trick shot Adidas advert: Is it real or fake and what boots is he wearing?,"Widely recognised as one of the world‚Äôs best ever footballers, Lionel Messi has been the face of Adidas football since his emergence and continues to be, as seen in their latest trick shot video. As brilliant as Messi is with a ball at his feet, even some of his biggest fans could be left contemplating the truthfulness of his trick shots in this video, while wearing Adidas‚Äô latest football boots. So is it real and what new boots is he wearing? GOAL takes a look. The video itself shows Messi launching the ‚ÄòAl Rihla‚Äô ball, which will be used at the 2022 World Cup, into the ball bag three times in a succession. He then strolls away and giving his approval with a thumbs up. Notably, the camera then pans towards Messi's boots - the Diamond Edges - which are the actual subject of the video. Thus far, neither Messi nor Adidas have commented on whether or not the video is bona fide or if it has been edited. Interestingly, the video itself is reminiscent of one in which former Manchester United and Real Madrid star David Beckham starred in, where he was asked to kick three balls into three separate bins. Despite Beckham‚Äôs amazing talents, fans remain convinced that the clip was indeed edited, given the difficulty of the challenge, and the Messi clip has elicited a similar reaction. Unsurprisingly, fans in the comments sections of the video have already begun debating this, with some labelling him as 'The GOAT‚Äô and commenting that it‚Äôs too easy for him. Others have questioned if it is real and even praised the editing of the video. Messi is wearing Adidas‚Äô Diamond Edge boots, which come in a dark blue, light blue and white colourway. As you can tell in the caption of the video which reads ""1, 2, 3, feeling good in Diamond Edge."" That particular pair comes in a collection of Diamond Edge boots, which you can view on the official Adidas website. Do you think the video is real or fake?

Maduka Okoye: Fans allege Nigeria goalkeeper ‚Äòfaked‚Äô illness to miss Ghana showdown,"Maduka Okoye feigned illness in a bid to miss Nigeria‚Äôs crucial 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifier against Ghana, football fans have alleged. The Nigeria Football Federation confirmed on Tuesday that the Sparta Rotterdam goalkeeper will be missing when Augustine Eguavoen‚Äôs men square up against the Black Stars in Kumasi on Friday. As a result, Enyimba goalkeeper John Noble has been called up to join Francis Uzoho and Daniel Akpeyi in the team‚Äôs camp. Fans seem not convinced by Okoye‚Äôs predicament, and they went on social media to slam the 22-year-old for his excuse. Most of them felt he chose that path to avoid another backlash as greeted his howler against Tunisia in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 fixture. Maduka Okoye chose to exempt himself to save himself from further embarrassment.

"The Best Dressed Premier League footballers: Hector Bellerin, Jack Grealish and William Saliba bring the drip","The relationship between football and fashion has arguably never been stronger. Brands and designers are being welcomed into the sport, creating special-edition releases and fourth kits, while players are now chosen to front campaigns. At the heart of this relationship is the players themselves, who have moved on from the typical stereotypes of footballers‚Äô fashion sense. Instead, we‚Äôve got Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Tom Davies embrace of boundary-pushing designs, Hector Bellerin‚Äôs love for sustainable streetwear or Tyler Adam‚Äôs Jordan collection. With the new season almost underway, this is the Premier League‚Äôs best dressed XI.

"‚ÄòHaaland will make defenders' lives horrible, he has everything!‚Äô - Van Dijk impressed by 'direct' Man City striker","Virgil van Dijk managed to shut out Erling Haaland during his personal battle with the Manchester City new boy in the 2022 Community Shield, but the Liverpool defender still saw enough from the Norwegian to suggest that he will ‚Äúmake defenders‚Äô lives horrible‚Äù in the 2022-23 campaign. A ¬£51 million ($62m) summer signing for the Premier League champions drew a blank against the FA Cup holders as Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side secured a 3-1 victory at the King Power Stadium in Leicester. Haaland had a few sights of goal in that contest, with the crossbar rattled late on as he fluffed his lines from a couple of yards out, but the expectation is that he will terrorise opponents once fully up to speed and adjusted to the demands of life in England. Van Dijk was delighted to have done his job against Haaland and City, with the Blues‚Äô only goal coming from Julian Alvarez following a VAR check, but he said afterwards of facing a prolific No.9: ‚ÄúThe focus is always the same for every striker. ‚ÄúHe obviously has a lot of qualities that can make life difficult for defenders. He will make defenders' lives in England horrible! ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so direct. He has everything; he can head the ball, he‚Äôs quick. But today we kept him at bay. He had one chance, well two chances, but other than that we did well together.‚Äù Liverpool win the Community Shield  üèÜ pic.twitter.com/7Lw9ACt5ik While Haaland was unable to find the net against Liverpool, the Reds‚Äô own big-money No.9 did get his name on the scoresheet after stepping off the bench. Darwin Nunez will be leading the line for Klopp‚Äôs side, with Roberto Firmino expected to fill back-up duties, but he is another that is having to adjust quickly to the challenges posed by the Premier League. Quizzed on what Haaland needs to do in order to master the English top-flight, Van Dijk said: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not going to give him too much advice! But obviously, he will know that he has to focus on his own game and not what others have to say. ‚ÄúThere is pressure on players who are coming in with a big price tag, but what can you do? You come in to perform, and the club pays a transfer fee for you. You just have to work, and in his case try to score as many goals as possible. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the same for Darwin in our case.‚Äù Liverpool will open their 2022-23 Premier League campaign at home to Fulham next Saturday, with City starting the defence of their crown a day later away at West Ham.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-defenders-lives-horrible-has-everything-van-dijk-man/blt0ae9b3fa8778eedc,Chris Burton,beeeaca1-8738-460f-bcbe-f127109434b9
Brilliant Bernardo taking the fight to biggest rivals for Pep's Man City bullies,"On an almost perfect return to his home city, perhaps the only thing that went wrong for Bernardo Silva on Tuesday was that he was denied a first ever Manchester City hat-trick. The Portugal midfielder could not have dreamt that his trip back to Lisbon for City's last-16 Champions League clash with Sporting C.P. would go this well. And yet it should come as no shock, as Bernardo is showing that he is able to thrive more than most when faced with a rival, regardless of whether that is because of a personal grudge or one of the few teams who can match City in the Premier League. A mischievous smile could be seen on the 27-year-old's face as the former Benfica academy player lined up for the Champions League anthem at the home of his boyhood rivals. It was even broader 17 minutes later, as he celebrated in front of the home fans after his thumping half-volley crashed down off the underside of the crossbar to give City a 2-0 lead. üí• Bernardo Silva üí•He's slammed the ball home right on the half-volley! A tricky technique made to look so easy... ü§§Man City are flying! pic.twitter.com/va3h6S9T4c BERNARDO SILVA. üò±The technique on this strike. üöÄ pic.twitter.com/DHpoaWTSiP By the time Bernardo's low shot was deflected in off Goncalo Inacio for City‚Äôs fourth just before half-time, City were utterly bullying the Portuguese champions, with their midfield playmaker having the time of his life. The boos and whistles that had tried to intimidate Bernardo and three of his fellow ex-Benfica team-mates - Ederson, Ruben Dias and Joao Cancelo - had long been silenced. He gave a wave to the crowd when he headed in for half-time, with the home fans' only enjoyment coming early in the second period when Bernardo's header that would have earned him the match ball was ruled out for offside by VAR. That was, though, a short relief, as Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side continued their dominance with the ruthless control that has seen them take charge of the Premier League title race. ""Was I very offside? It would have been great to score a hat-trick but I'm happy with two goals,‚Äù Bernardo told BT Sport at full-time. ""I am Portuguese and I'm from the other side of the city, so it was special to score here in my home town.‚Äù For Guardiola it underlines that his team can now go anywhere in the world and play on the front foot, with players like Bernardo possessing the courage to take the fight to any opponent. Skilful, quick-thinking, tactically and technically brilliant, Bernardo also has the battling instincts to back up his talent. He showed it earlier in the season, when he dazzled at Anfield on his first return to the ground with spectators since a social media row with some Liverpool fans. Back at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, he sparkled again. Driving past Sporting defenders with ease, linking up with Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling to pass their opponents off the pitch and taking his chances when they came. ""Always I push him to score more goals,"" Guardiola said. ""Not talking about how good he is, he has everything. He has the ability to score more goals. Today in his city, from the rivals Benfica, I'm sure he's happy."" Bernardo was not the only one ex-Benfica player having fun on the night, either. Ruben Dias seemed to demand the ball at every opportunity in the opening minutes to attract even more jeers; Ederson pulled off an outrageous drawback and no-look pass to flummox a pressing Paulinho; and Joao Cancelo did the same with an audacious dummy. And they had every right to enjoy themselves. Riyad Mahrez‚Äôs opener, given after a long VAR check, and a Phil Foden goal either side of Bernardo‚Äôs strikes saw City become the first away team to have a four-goal half-time lead in the knockout stages of the Champions League. Raheem Sterling then scored a brilliant fifth to join the top-10 list of all-time City‚Äôs scorers with 127 in all competitons. But the night belonged to Bernardo. Sporting fans hurled their insults when he was substituted late in the game, but they must fear what he might do at the Etihad Stadium in the second leg next month. It seems almost unnecessary to play the game after such a one-sided affair, and with both sides concentrating on domestic title challenges. Guardiola may well, therefore, rotate his side for the rematch, but Bernardo will no doubt want to play and embarrass Sporting all over again.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bernardo-fight-rivals-pep-man-city-bullies/bltfa4a004703f13288,Jonathan Smith,28aaafaf-4a04-4c74-aa6d-f815f788fa24
"'Should I play, or will I be abused?' - Rainbow Laces shines spotlight on transphobia in British football","""A ball was passed back to me, and to try and put me off the striker screamed 'go on big man'. For me, it was obvious that it was intended to abuse."" For Blair Hamilton, it was a moment of complete shock, followed by anger and upset - the first time she had suffered transphobic abuse from an opposition player on the pitch since coming out more than four years ago. Hamilton, who plays for Hastings United in the¬†London and South East Regional Women's Football League, the fifth tier of the game in England, was playing in goal against Bromley in an FA Cup third-round qualifying match on October 24. Heading for a 2-0 defeat in the final minutes of the game, the sudden heckle from an opposition player stunned her completely. Speaking to¬†GOAL, Hamilton says:¬†""I was shell shocked, to be honest. Straight away, I thought, 'did I just hear that?' Then I started screaming at the referee, and my centre-back, she heard it and started screaming at the referee. ""I was angry, upset - previous abuses I've had have never been direct to my face. Murmurings in the crowd, usually I don't hear them until someone lets me know afterwards. ""This is the first time in my four-and-a-half years in the women's game that anyone has abused me to my face. I won't lie, the red mist came down. Usually I'm composed, but I lost the plot, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that. You could have put six shots against me and I wouldn't have saved any of them, I was all over the place. I wanted justice. ""What I didn't get, our team was losing 2-0 and we were in the final five or 10 minutes. I couldn't get my head around why someone would do that when they're winning. You've got the upper hand, why do you feel the need to abuse someone? ""It has had a massive effect on me; luckily our game was cancelled the weekend after, because I went to training and my head was not in it. I trained terribly, I could not stop thinking about it."" It forms part of a trend, identified by transgender players and campaign groups, of a rise in transphobic abuse in football recently, as the matter becomes more of a point for toxic debate in social and traditional media. Football Association (FA) rules surrounding whether transgender females can play women's football are lengthy and stringent, however¬†Natalie Washington, campaign lead for Football vs Transphobia, says she is hearing more and more about players being targeted with abuse both on and off the pitch, and that a more focused effort from the sport's governing bodies is required. She tells¬†GOAL:¬†""Anecdotally, I am hearing more often from people who have experienced some form of transphobia in football. That cuts across playing or attending games. It speaks to a wider growth in transphobia. Transphobic hate is growing in society more generally, it is more at the forefront of peoples' minds. ""We are talking to FA and county associations, it is very early days in trying to get them to understand what transphobic abuse even looks like. I ran a session a while back with referees about how they can recognise transphobic abuse, and that is one of the big barriers. ""There is not a widely accepted definition of transphobia, it is a fast-evolving space, the language is different to 20 years ago but society has not necessarily kept up, so it is difficult for referees or FAs who are administering reports on harassment or discrimination to make the right decisions. ""We need to get to a point where transphobia is seen as real abuse and is taken seriously. Particularly with transphobic language, we can do better education to help clubs and academies to understand what it actually looks like, to give tools and resources to deal with that. ""Also, we have to have the processes to deal with incidents where people really want to hurt someone, and I would like to see county FAs make provisions in their policies for transphobia to show it is something that is taken seriously when reported. ""Kick It Out accepts reports of transphobic abuse through their app, but I still think we are at the stage where we are trying to make sure the football community at large has opposition to transphobia included in their policies."" That FA trans inclusion policy has been in place since 2014, from a review that began in 2012 - nine years ago. This is now being reviewed over the course of this season; the FA currently review player participation on a case by case basis. Edleen John, equality, diversity and inclusion director for the FA, says they continue to assert inclusion through their policies as much as possible. She tells GOAL: ""By participating in things like Rainbow Laces and making sure we are showcasing and talking about inclusion being our primary concern, and how we can put that into place in grassroots and recreational football, we continue to affirm and re-affirm that for us, football is for all."" Transphobia creating barriers to people taking part in football is an issue acknowledged by Jason Webber, equality, diversity, inclusion & integrity manager for the Football Association of Wales (FAW), who says they are working on ways to make victims feel they can be more comfortable reporting abuse, whether on the pitch, in the stands or online. The FAW has shown support for the LGBTQ+ community, most recently through extensive pride displays at Wales' World Cup qualifier against Belgium, but Webber acknowledges more consistent action has to be taken. He tells GOAL: ""The number of trans players we have in Wales is not as high as it should be. It's definitely something that we are conscious of, in regards to the environment within the game, ensuring that it is inclusive and that individuals are not getting transphobic abuse. I'm fully aware that it is something that is a wider societal issue, which has an impact within football.""We know all discrimination¬†is under-reported, in Wales and elsewhere, in football and across other sports. It is something we try to be very vocal¬†about, and we have seen a general increase following our campaigns and social media promotions. ""That visibility, while on its own can be a gesture, does form part of trying to raise awareness and ensuring people report these things and they are taken seriously. ""The way we are approaching¬†this, it's not just for a couple of weeks then we're done, we're trying to be proactive with raising visibility and providing education throughout the year for fans around the LGBTQ+ community. ""We are aware that the reports we get are not reflective of reality, and we are working hard to ensure every incident is reported so we can support the victims and educate the perpetrators, and make sure there are serious sanctions in place as well."" üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è Football is for everyone! Mae p√™l-droed yn g√™m i bawb. #RainbowLaces | #TogetherStronger pic.twitter.com/QWHjTRydoj Hamilton says she has had good support from Kick It Out and the PFA since reporting her abuse, but has had ""complete radio silence"" from Bromley and the FA¬†- and that she and her team-mates have resolved to take more direct action should a repeat event take place. ""My captain, Rebecca Relf, has been very supportive,"" she says.¬†""We came to a decision afterwards that if this ever happened again, we would walk off as a collective unit. They say, we know this is a contentious topic, but we have played with you for eight months now, we win games and lose games, the fact you were assigned male at birth has nothing to do with it. ""It's great having all this support, but they can't make me forget what happened. I'm a Rangers fan, and last year you had the Glen Kamara racism incident. There are parallels; why would a player abuse someone just because they are 'different'? I've never truly understood how Kamara felt until that happened to me. I never thought that would happen."" Hamilton switched from male to female football in 2017 after beginning to medically transition, and was approached by the women's captain at the University of Aberdeen, where she was a student, asking if she wanted to join the club. For the 31-year-old, it is not the first time she has been singled out for complaints based on her gender - last season, she says, an opposing team filed a complaint to the FA despite recording a 3-1 victory, saying Hamilton kept the score down and the hit to their goal difference could cost them the title - but the recent increase in media coverage of trans people, especially in sport, has had an effect. In particular,¬†a recent report by the¬†Sports Councils Equality Group (SCEG),¬†which said ""for many sports, the inclusion of transgender people, fairness and safety cannot co-exist in a single competitive model"" has given players like Hamilton concerns that they will be blocked from being part of football clubs that are central to their lives and well-being. It is a particular source of frustration for Hamilton, given that off the pitch she is a doctoral research student in ""the effects of testosterone suppression or supplementation on the athletic performance of transgender athletes"" - but says she and other scientists in the same area of research saw their findings ignored by a report she views as one-sided and not fit for purpose. She says:¬†""It went the same way as World Rugby, saying trans women are too dangerous to play in the women's category. They make the mistake of categorising trans women athletes as elite male athletes. That is not what you see in the clinical data, comparing trans women and cisgender men, they are nowhere near each other. ""They have ignored a lot of our research. We wrote a paper on this very topic, on trans women in archery and shooting, we talked about the process of safety and inclusion, and how you could do that with examples. This was completely ignored. ""One of the first lines of the SCEG report is 'no consensus could be found in the scientific community on this topic'. Hold the phone, we have the consensus of 70 of the world's leading sports medicine practitioners saying this is the route to go and you have just ignored it. ""It blatantly looks like they have taken one side of the argument and not balanced it off with the other, which is not the way science should be done."" Washington agrees, saying a golden chance to find an inclusive balance in British sport has been passed up in favour of giving renewed licence to the divisive rhetoric which characterises the transgender ""debate"". She says:¬†""It's a missed opportunity to really look at some of the ways in which we can improve inclusion in sport, it feels like a backwards step. There are many sports in the UK which have done really great work on inclusion for trans and non-binary people, and this really does not seem to pick up on that and move it forward. ""As the conversation around trans people's participation in sport has become more toxic, it is unsurprising that we see that playing out on pitches on Saturdays and Sundays up and down the country. People are consuming that narrative, and I think that gives people a licence to act up."" The divisive status of the SCEG report was further highlighted by new guidance from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which confirmed there should be no assumption transgender athletes automatically have unfair advantage. Regarding the FA's own policy review for transgender footballers in England, John says they are working to make their rules as firm and fair as possible, and promised they would work with as many interested parties as possible. She said: ""We haven't mapped out the process in detail yet, we'll be working with our colleagues in governance, in the medical team, our research team. It will be a broad spectrum, the timeframe has not been mapped out yet. We will have partnerships with organisations like Gendered Intelligence, it will be broad in how we gather our information and form our policy. ""It is fair to say when applying our policy from 2014, it has been a successful application of case by case basis, which helps the FA remain fully sensitive to the needs of transgender participants, and that will be critical to bear in mind. In our review we will look at our policy and decide, is that the right approach? Does that still work, is it still relevant?"" Make Football Everyone‚Äôs Game. #TakeYourChance #RainbowLaces pic.twitter.com/lk476ZaRwd Webber is unconvinced by the SCEG and IOC reports and how much they realistically apply to trans sportspeople, and says the FAW will not be swayed from their support - even in the face of targeted online abuse. He says: ""I think you could question how much consultation has been done with all of those reports within the trans community, both within sport and those who are not in order to find out why not and what can be improved. ""From our perspective, our core is football for everyone, and we want out game is one where if you are transgender, you can be involved. Any barriers, or perceived barriers, need to be addressed. We know what those barriers are, they have existed for a long time. We are trying to lead the way ourselves, and not be governed, guided or forced by others in what we are doing. ""I've personally been targeted¬†by anti-trans groups because of some of the work we're doing, but I'm fine with that. Over the last 18 months since I joined, some of the comments on our social media channels have been concerning, but I have seen and felt a shift in some of the attitudes towards the community, and I certainly feel the work we have done has had an impact. ""If all we are putting out is white straight non-disabled boys on all our comms, then people would not be represented in our game."" While Hamilton thinks little of the SCEG report as a scientist, as a footballer she admits the weeks since the report came out have been the first where she has actively considered whether she would be welcome on a football pitch. She says:¬†""From a personal point of view, after this report, for the first time I had the thought, should I go and play? Will I be welcomed? Will I be abused, attacked or heckled? ""I never usually think like that. I had to speak with my club about it, it put a lot of anxiety in my head, and has made me wonder if what happened at Bromley is going to start happening a lot more often. I know other trans female footballers who have felt very similar, it has put that seed of doubt in our minds. ""You think about the last year, with lockdowns but with sports teams allowed to train, for a good few months the only other people I got to see were the Hastings players, these girls have become like a family, we have these roots and bonds. And now this report saying I'm unsafe, with zero data from trans athletes, they are going to rip that away to be overly cautious. It's crazy. ""I have probably played 100 games in women's football and I have never once injured another player, never once been sent off. I've had games where I've conceded six, games where I have conceded none. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make a difference. ""If I was dominating the sport, would I not be up in the WSL? Scotland would be looking at me. They're not, and that tells you there are female footballers who can run rings around me and are much more talented. Sport is multi-faceted, and there is no magic wand to fix it."" Washington agrees that the potential loss of football for transgender people should the SCEG guidance be heeded could be devastating, and even more so for those who play at a lower and less competitive level than Hamilton - who,¬†despite only playing in tier five of the English game, is among the highest level trans players currently active. Washington says:¬†""Football has been massively important in dealing with the difficult stuff that comes through transition, and building a new social circle, being on the pitch for a while and forgetting everything else that's going on, having some time away. ""I have thought about what might happen if I can't play, and know lots of others have had the same thought. ""If I can't play women's football any more, it's the end of me playing football. I have played football with men occasionally in a five-a-side kickabout, but physically I can't compete - I can barely compete with the women my age. Socially it wouldn't feel right either, like being forced to be someone I'm not again, and I'm done with that in my life. ""I also know it is putting people off getting involved; the ultimate losers in all of this are the trans people who self-exclude because they are worried they are not going to be welcome or think they will get banned, or have to out themselves in some rigorous process, and thus meaning they don't get the mental or physical health benefits, which is a real shame."" Asked about players feeling confident in reporting transphobia that they would be treated properly, John said: ""We view all discrimination as serious.  ""There is no sliding scale for one form of discrimination over another, we want it all to be absent from our game. We investigate any allegations of discrimination in a serious way to make sure we understand what has happened and take any action necessary. ""[Transphobia] isn't something we want in our game, we don't want anyone to feel that they cannot participate in a way that works for them. Rainbow Laces is broad, and we need to engage on multiple topics in that area."" While recent abuses and an uncertain future have put Hamilton and other trans footballers under immense pressure and scrutiny, she still regards her experiences in women's football as being primarily of feeling included, happy and belonging - with one memory from her time in Scottish football the particular standout. ""Dod Duncan, my old manager at Grampian Ladies, where I played before I moved south, something he said to me really rang through. After a game, he said: 'The one thing you need to realise is you're not Blair the transgender goalkeeper, you are Blair the goalkeeper, you are one of us'. ""It's a testament to the man, it's nice that someone can look beyond the thing everyone else is throwing their arms up about. To see me as the gender I align with, it really empowered me, and made me feel like he had massive belief in me. ""It's such a small thing as well; people ask, surely winning trophies or saving a penalty in a cup final must be your best experience, but it's the little things that count.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rainbow-laces-transphobia-british-football/blt52a3d9ca02720e30,Emma Smith,3c3e6765-5c9f-4a18-9010-2599918e3f05

It took 22 spot-kicks for a winner to be determined at the home of English football on Sunday, with goalkeepers required to step up after all outfield players had converted from 12 yards. Caoimhin Kelleher held his nerve for Liverpool before Kepa Arrizabalaga fluffed his lines for Chelsea as the Spaniard fired high over the top, and Klopp was left to savour a first League Cup success for Liverpool since 2012. Dalglish was the last manager to guide the Reds to League Cup glory, with the Scot eager to remind Klopp when embracing in the tunnel.

"England's route to World Cup 2022 final: Knockout stage opponents, dates & where to watch on TV","England have won the World Cup just once in their history, but will have their sights firmly set on going all the way at Qatar 2022. Gareth Southgate's side finished runners-up at Euro 2020 after being beaten on penalties by Italy last summer, but will be hoping to go one better on the global stage, having also reached the semi-finals at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. What will England need to do to become world champions for the first time since 1966? GOAL takes a look at the Three Lions potential route to the final. Southgate's men finished top of the group with seven points, with United States coming in two points behind them in second place. The Three Lions started strong by beating Iran 6-2 before being held to a goalless draw by USMNT. They then finished the group stage with a 3-0 victory against Wales. England finished top of Group B which means they will face the runners-up from Group A. Netherlands topped the group ahead of Senegal which means England faced the Lions of Teranga. The game went ahead on December 4, 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium, with England winning 3-0 to progress to the last eight. England will face France in the quarter-finals after Les Bleus beat Poland 3-1 in their last 16 tie. That quarter-final will take place at 7pm GMT (2pm ET) on December 10, also at the Al Bayt Stadium. If England make it through to the semi-finals, they will face either the winners of Groups F or H or the runners up of Groups E or G. That would put them up against Morocco from Group F, Portugal or South Korea from Group H, Spain or Japan from Group E or Brazil or Switzerland from Group G. The semi-final will take place on December 14 at 7pm GMT (2pm ET) at the Al Bayt Stadium.

Kroos: Three clones of me wouldn't make a very good Real Madrid midfield,"Real Madrid star Toni Kroos does not believe that three versions of him would make an ideal midfield for the Spanish champions. Kroos shook off injury troubles to play a key role for Madrid as they claimed La Liga and Champions League crowns in the 2021-22 campaign. The Germany international starred in midfield alongside Luka Modric and Casemiro, and he believes the three players complement each other, whereas playing alongside clones of himself would not make a good combination. Asked about the strength of his partnership with Modric and Casemiro, he told Kicker: ""First and foremost it is the quality. Then it's because each of us knows our own characteristics exactly and contributes them accordingly so that they work together. ""Three versions of Toni Kroos? That wouldn't be so effective. We complement each other on the pitch because we want to play together and be successful together. And we have a great team around us that defends at the back and executes at the front."" Kroos has now won three La Liga titles and the Champions League four times since joining from Bayern Munich in 2014. The 32-year-old looked back on his favourite title success with the Santiago Bernabeu team, admitting that his first win is the one he remembers most fondly. ""Winning the first title with Real Madrid in 2016 was the most valuable for me,"" he added.  ""One of the reasons I switched to Real at the time was to win the Champions League with this big club.  ""That was successful that evening. And this title meant more to me than winning the title with Bayern, because I missed the final with an injury. That was therefore only half a win for me.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kroos-three-clones-of-me-wouldn-t-make-a-very-good-real/blt00dfa2ecaf76abaf,Peter McVitie,d6bad8e3-5ae1-47cf-b494-6262a6eecffb
'Incredible impact' - Liverpool boss Klopp hails German neuroscientists who played key role in Carabao Cup win,"Jurgen Klopp has hailed the ‚Äúincredible impact‚Äù made by a pair of German neuroscientists in Liverpool‚Äôs Carabao Cup triumph. The Reds have been working with neuro11, a Potsdam-based company, since the summer, and its co-founders, Patrick Hantschke and Dr Niklas Hausler, were at Wembley on Sunday to watch Klopp‚Äôs side beat Chelsea after a long and nerve-wracking penalty shootout. All 11 of Liverpool‚Äôs players, including goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, scored from the spot, and Klopp revealed that neuro11 had worked with his squad ahead of the final around the idea of set-pieces, and in particular penalties. Asked about the work of neuro11, he told reporters: ‚ÄúIncredible impact. It‚Äôs actually a nice story. A few years ago I got in contact with them because I found their ideas interesting, and now they are a fixed part of our coaching staff.¬† ‚ÄúThey are not here all the time, they are in Germany obviously, but they come over quite frequently. They were here for the last week, and before that they were here for five days.¬† ‚ÄúAll the players are really excited about it. It‚Äôs about bringing specific players before a set-piece in the right mindset by doing the stuff we do on the pitch. ‚ÄúEverything gets measured. They are neuroscientists, and it‚Äôs incredibly interesting and incredibly important to us. ‚Äú[It is] a very interesting new chapter for us because it‚Äôs not only penalties - although in the last week it was a lot about penalties because of the upcoming final. It‚Äôs about free-kicks, all kinds of [other] set-pieces as well. ‚ÄúI said after the game the last boys in the shoot-out] were not on the list, so the burden is mine because nobody expected it to go on too long. But even with Ibou (Ibrahima Konate) they worked together and that helped. Klopp added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an interesting question, if Chelsea worked together with them as well, because there was just one penalty difference. But it‚Äôs about the confidence they gave the boys that they really can do it, and I‚Äôm really happy about it. ‚ÄúPenalties were the most obvious thing, but it‚Äôs all the set-pieces ‚Äì corners, free-kicks, direct free-kicks, crosses, all those kinds of things. ‚ÄúWhoever comes in those positions and situations [regularly] has extra sessions with the neuro11 guys.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-klopp-german-neuroscientists-carabao-cup-win/blt5eb9f700922eaf69,Neil Jones,034c14c2-9ffa-46f7-aa8c-84df06ff5bf9
Maxwell: The UEFA Youth League is a perfect mirror to the Champions League,"Maxwell, UEFA's chief of football development, has lauded the impact of the Youth League just nine years after the founding of the competition.¬† The yearly tournament, which in many ways is similar to that of the senior men's competitions, has attracted big crowds and has been treated as a major piece of silverware for Europe's major academies like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea.¬† Maxwell believes that its impact has benefited European footballers, allowing hundreds to experience pressured competition before going on to do it in the senior game.¬† ""I think it is the highest competition where you can face the best teams and players in Europe,"" Maxwell told¬†GOAL. ""It is a good opportunity to face different clubs and coaches of football.¬† ""The process of development gives a great platform to perform for players, coaches and even referees. We see that the competition has a huge impact on youth football.¬† ""We see 800 or so players go from there to Champions League, Europa League and Conference League. There‚Äôs a huge impact on the development of those youth players.¬† ""We had Deportivo playing Dynamo Kiev and there were 20,000 fans. It is like a real competition for men.¬† ""We see that players go out and shine under this pressure into the first team. It is an opportunity and it is the top level of youth football.¬† ""Often, you see around 75 minutes onwards that they get more cramps than in other competitions because of the difficulty of the matches. ""We are seeing UEFA Youth League winners do it in the Champions League and Europa League with Mason Mount and Andreas Christensen doing it at Chelsea. There's also Munir El Haddadi who won with Barcelona and then the Europa League with Sevilla. ""This competition is a platform to develop players in the highest competitive scenario and bring them an added value with educational programmes. They face the best and that helps develop for the professional level and to compete at the highest level."" Maxwell retired from football in 2017 with the most club trophies won by a professional player. That record was since surpassed by Barcelona full-back Dani Alves, while he was at Paris Saint-Germain.¬† After retiring, Maxwell went on to become PSG's assistant sporting director which coincided with the most successful period in the club's history.¬† Through his role at PSG, and after completing his UEFA Executive Master for International Players (UEFA MIP) course, Maxwell got his big role at Europe's governing body for football.¬† ""I think former players should understand that life is not just about being a ‚Äòformer player‚Äô,"" the former left-back who impressively speaks English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese added.¬† ""You need to work and educate yourself for life after. We have courses and preparations with UEFA having the best platform to educate former players.¬† ""When you have lived football, then giving back is important. I enjoyed it a lot so it is time for me to give back as well. ""The opportunity I have to work with the Youth League is crucial. Not all players finish with elite careers, it is an uncertain period.¬† ""Everyone has the dream, drive and ambition but it is still uncertain that you succeed. I think it is a big responsibility for me and UEFA to show that there‚Äôs a future and they can be educated and prepare themselves in different ways.¬† ""I have been in a football world from five or six years old. I lived insecure times in Brazil and the beginning in the Netherlands. Afterwards, I succeeded in different countries.¬† ""There were a lot of ups and downs but I know I am able to look back on my career with a lot of happiness.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maxwell-uefa-youth-league-perfect-mirror-champions-league/blt03dc90efe4dae59b,Nizaar Kinsella,278076cb-9495-4c9b-8858-9fb70a505346
"Afcon 2021: Comoros pick left-back Chaker Alhadhur in goal for Cameroon clash, Ahamada return blocked","Comoros will use an outfield player in goal for the biggest match in their history after all three of their goalkeepers were ruled out of taking to the field against hosts Cameroon in Monday‚Äôs Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 match. Defender Chaker Alhadhur is the player selected by the Coelacantes for the unenviable task of having to keep a rampant Cameroon side ‚Äî top scorers in the tournament so far ‚Äî at bay for the minnows, ranked 132nd, as they contest their first ever knockout game at a major tournament. All three of Comoros‚Äô recognised goalkeepers were ruled out on Sunday; Ali Ahamada and Moyadh Ousseni after returning positive Covid tests, and Salim Ben Boina due to a shoulder injury. Ahamada had appeared primed to return to action on Monday after returning a negative test, only for the Confederation of African Football to block his return on the basis that he hadn‚Äôt completed a mandatory five-day isolation after initially testing positive. The islanders returned 12 positive cases over the weekend, including head coach Amir Abdou, for whom assistant manager Yours Zerdouk will deputise during Monday‚Äôs meeting. Comoros had anticipated this situation on Sunday, before the prospect of Ahamada‚Äôs return had been raised, with goalkeeper coach Jean-Daniel Padovani telling journalists that were in the process of identifying which outfield player would take responsibility for going in goal. ""We have met with the staff, talked things through, got all the healthy players together and tried to put things into perspective,"" Padovani began. ‚ÄúWe've got some potential goalkeepers, and we‚Äôre laughing about it, we prefer to approach it this way. It‚Äôs funny. ‚ÄúWe've not exactly identified who will play in goal yet and even if we had, I wouldn't tell you. ""There are some who have shown during training sessions that they can play as a goalkeeper, but it's a strange situation, so we're working through all possible solutions.‚Äù Plans to use Alhadhur in goal were put on ice earlier on Monday, with Comoros putting Ahamada and defensive midfielder Yacine Bourhane on a flight from Garoua to Yaounde after the pair tested negative and promptly ended their Covid isolation. However, Caf later blocked the goalkeeper‚Äôs return to action after appearing to clarify the rules surrounding when a player can play after initially receiving a positive coronavirus test on Sunday evening, less than 24 hours before the meeting between the hosts and the Nations Cup minnows. In light of these fleshed-out guidelines ‚Äî which note that a player must quarantine for five days after his first positive diagnosis, regardless of any subsequent negative tests ‚Äî Ahamada‚Äôs Yaounde return proved in vain. Instead, it will fall to AC Ajaccio left-sider Alhadhur ‚Äî currently playing in the French second tier ‚Äî to deputise between the sticks on Monday evening. The 30-year-old is one of the older heads in the Comoros squad, having made his debut for the minnows‚Äîcompeting in their first Nations Cup‚Äîin 2014. The full-back has spent the entirety of his career in French football, with the likes of Nantes, Caen and Cheateauroux, but must now keep the Indomitable Lions ‚Äî and their array of attacking options ‚Äî at bay in the biggest match of his career. Comoros are enjoying a memorable maiden performance at the biennial tournament, having defeated Ghana 3-2 on Tuesday to eliminate the four-time champions and advance to the knockout stage at their expense. As well as all three goalkeepers, Nakibou Aboubakari, Bourhane, Mohamed M'Changama, Kassim Abdallah and Alexis Souahy are absent with the coronavirus, while Ben Boina, Faiz Selemani, and Kassim M‚ÄôDahoma are also missing for the contest, leaving the Comoros with just seven available substitutes from a possible 17. Even without a recognised goalkeeper, Comoros would have been forced to honour the fixture against Cameroon as per a Caf directive issued before the tournament which outlined that teams would be required to play a match if they had a minimum of 11 players available. ""In the event of the absence of a goalkeeper,‚Äù the Caf statement read, ‚Äúanother player from the team must replace the goalkeeper, provided the total number of available players is at least eleven.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-comoros-pick-left-back-chaker-alhadhur-in-goal/blt001a2719f0efe7d2,Ed Dove,eee65923-a4ea-426e-a2ab-7209fb48661e
"Elneny: Arsenal focused on Champions League return, ready for derby against Tottenham Hotspur","Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny has maintained their main focus now is to return the club to Champions League action for next season. The 29-year-old Egypt international has stepped in well since the injury suffered by Ghana international Thomas Partey, during Arsenal‚Äôs 3-0 defeat against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on April 4. Though he missed two subsequent defeats against Brighton & Hove Albion and Southampton since Arteta preferred Albert Sambi Lokonga, he was drafted into the starting XI in the game against Chelsea where he partnered Granit Xhaka as they won 4-2 at Stamford Bridge. Since then, Elneny has started in the 3-1 victory against Manchester United, the 2-1 win against West Ham United and was also solid as they dispatched Leeds United 2-1 in their most recent fixture at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. ‚ÄúEveryone is focused on achieving the club‚Äôs objective which is to qualify for the Champions League,‚Äù Elneny told beIN Sports after the game as quoted by KingFut. With his contract running down at the end of the season, Elneny was asked about his future at the club: ‚ÄúThe club will speak with the players regarding contract renewals in due course,‚Äù the Egyptian responded. On the game against Leeds, Elneny said: ‚ÄúWe missed a lot of chances in the first half. ‚ÄúWe wanted to score a third goal but we are happy to get the three points and to win is the most important thing for the team at the moment. ‚ÄúI think we controlled the game and did not allow Leeds any chances other than the goal they scored.‚Äù Arsenal will next travel to face Tottenham Hotspur in the North London derby with a win assuring them of a Champions League spot next season. ‚ÄúThe derby against Tottenham will be tough, and our goal is to win at their stadium and earn qualification to the Champions League,‚Äù Elneny continued. So far in this season, Elneny has managed 11 appearances overall and played 530 minutes. He has been selected in the starting XI in five of these appearances across their 35 fixtures and has been used off the bench as a substitute on six occasions. In total, he has recorded two league assists this term. Last season, he played 23 top-flight games for Arsenal and scored one goal. Elneny returned to Arsenal in August 2020 after a loan spell at Besiktas, for whom he made 27 league appearances in total, scoring one goal and providing three assists.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/elneny-arsenal-focused-on-champions-league-return-ready-for/bltf2df1311d2280a17,Dennis Mabuka,7e538855-599c-4c73-82e0-9379d8e8d675
Ex-Arsenal flop Willian could make sensational Premier League return as Fulham eye transfer move,"Willian could be set for a sensational Premier League return with Fulham interested in signing the forward from Corinthians, GOAL understands. The former Chelsea favourite's last spell in England with Arsenal ended acrimoniously, with the Gunners terminating his contract two years early following a disappointing first season at the club.  In that maiden campaign he managed just one goal in 35 appearances. However, he does have Premier League pedigree, helping Chelsea win two top-flight titles during his time at Stamford Bridge.  Since departing Arsenal Willian has been turning out for boyhood club Corinthians, where he has struggled to make an impact due to niggling injuries, netting just once in 44 games.  Despite his meagre goal tally, the 33-year-old is attracting interest from several overseas clubs.  This includes Premier League newbies Fulham, who are understood to already be negotiating the terms of a possible transfer. It is worth noting that Willian has a release clause in his contract - which has 16 months left to run - that facilitates a return to Europe.  He and his family lived in London for nine years, and he could be open to returning to the city with Fulham.  The Cottagers have made five signings ahead of the new season, but there is still space for another forward in their squad following the departure of Fabio Carvalho to Liverpool this summer.  So far, Fulham have brought in Manor Solomon from Shakhtar Donetsk and Andreas Pereira from Manchester United, while Joao Palhinha, Kevin Mbabu and Bernd Leno have also arrived.  Their Premier League season gets underway on Saturday lunchtime, when they host Liverpool at Craven Cottage.

Real Madrid vs Barcelona: Who has the better Clasico record?,"Real Madrid and Barcelona are now just one outing away from their 254th competitive El Clasico contest, with little to choose between the two sides when it comes to their overall record. With both teams boasting big budgets and reputations that appeal to world-class performers across the planet, their respective ranks have been loaded with match-winners down the years. Who, though, has held the upper hand in a famous rivalry that dates back to 1929? GOAL takes a look at how a couple of the biggest institutions in club football have fared in direct combat. The March 2023 La Liga fixture at the Santiago Bernabeu was the 253rd competitive Clasico, though Madrid and Barca have met a further 34 times in friendlies and other non-competitive matches. The overall head-to-head record of meetings between the teams has been extremely tight, with Real - who have hit a century of successes - boasting bragging rights in competitive outings while Barca get the edge when exhibition games are added to the pot. Competition Games Madrid wins Barca wins Draws La Liga 186 77 74 35 Copa del Rey 36 12 16 8 Champions League 8 3 2 3 Other competitions* 23 9 8 6 Total 252 101 100 52 'Other competitions' includes the Copa de la Liga and Supercopa de Espana. Pre-season friendly and exhibition matches are not included. Away from competitive action, the sample size is much smaller. There have been 34 exhibition games featuring the two sides down the years, with Barca emerging victorious in 20 of those. Real have claimed only four wins, while there have been 10 draws. After Barca made Pep Guardiola their coach in the summer of 2008, the tide started to turn in their favour somewhat. In La Liga, Barca won 13 of the Clasicos played after Guardiola's appointment, drawing four and losing six. They also won the 2010-11 Champions League semi-final, which was the first time the clubs¬†met in that competition since 2002. The loss of Guardiola from the dugout, and the departure of seven-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi on the field, have hindered the Blaugrana cause, but they remain fiercely competitive and continue to compete for major honours alongside old adversaries. Barca's recent period of dominance has seen them overtake their rivals in terms of their respective trophy cabinets, though Madrid remain well ahead in La Liga. Los Blancos have won 34¬†league championships ‚Äî a Spanish record ‚Äî and are eight ahead of the Blaugrana. They are also well clear when it comes to the Champions League, with 13¬†to Barca's five. Real won the UEFA Cup (now the Europa League) twice, while Barca are the most successful team in the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup with four triumphs. Barca did win the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup -¬†which eventually became the UEFA Cup -¬†three times, but that was¬†prior to its organisational takeover by UEFA. Competition Real Madrid Barcelona La Liga 34 26 Copa del Rey 19 31 Supercopa de Espana 12 14 Champions League 14 5 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 0 4 Europa League 2 0 UEFA Super Cup 5 5 Club World Cup 5 3 Total 91 97 'Champions League' includes European Cup wins and 'Europa League' includes UEFA Cup wins. Barca have won the Copa del Rey 12¬†times more than Madrid, though, and you can see their recent strength in the fact that they are not far behind when it comes to Club World Cups ‚Äî a competition that only started in 2000. Again, a closer look at more recent history presents a more flattering picture for Barcelona. Since the 1990-91 season, they have won La Liga 16¬†times to Madrid's 10. Barca have claimed the European crown five times in the same period, with Madrid just ahead on six. Both clubs endured a barren spell continentally in the 1970s and 1980s as English, Italian and German clubs dominated, but the difference in the Clasico competitors' European records can be attributed to the two decades before that. Madrid cleaned up through the early years of the European Cup, winning it five times in a row between 1956 and 1960 and again in 1966. They also dominated La Liga, winning it 18 times between 1950 and 1980 to Barca's five. The current era of football has been defined by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as much as it has by Real Madrid and Barcelona as clubs, though¬†that image has been broken with both players now playing elsewhere. The pair of superstars has battled it out year in, year out for the Ballon d'Or ever since Ronaldo decided to leave Manchester United for La Liga.¬† Messi surpassed Ronaldo with his six Ballons d'Or to the Portugal striker's five when he was awarded the honour in December 2019 - before going on to claim that crown again in 2021 after leaving Camp Nou for Paris Saint-Germain. Trophy Real Madrid Barcelona Ballon d'Or 12 12 After Karim Benzema's Ballon d'Or win last year, Real Madrid are now tied with Barcelona on 12 Ballons d'Or awards.¬† Johan Cruyff ‚Äî who, with three wins, is closest to Ronaldo and Messi, along with Michel Platini ‚Äî won it twice in a Blaugrana shirt, and Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, Hristo Stoichkov and Luis Suarez (the elder) also received it. After Alfredo di Stefano won two and Raymond Kopa another in consecutive years in the 1950s, Madrid endured something of a barren run ‚Äî something it is amusing to reflect upon now given their modern-day fame for signing 'Galacticos'. Their next Ballon d'Or did not come until 2000 and it may be contentious to categorise it solely as a Madrid win given it went to Luis Figo, who had spent half of the year on the other side of the rivalry before his shock move to the capital. Ronaldo Nazario and Fabio Cannavaro were then honoured before Ronaldo and Messi's takeover. Luka Modric's 2018 victory, which saw him beat Ronaldo while Messi didn't even place in the top three, momentarily¬†drew things level.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-barcelona-clasico-record-head-to-head/hxdm74dgfby81w9bsiejduy05,Goal,fa0c19c1-0a4e-456e-a3ce-87b18448c79a
Koeman didn't deserve to be treated the way he was by Barcelona ‚Äì Larsson,"Henrik Larsson worked as an assistant to Ronald Koeman during the Dutchman‚Äôs testing spell in charge of Barcelona and believes a legendary figure at Camp Nou ‚Äúdid not deserve‚Äù to be treated the way he was as the Catalan club‚Äôs board dumped him on the back of some questionable decisions behind the scenes. A former fan favourite from his playing days returned to the Liga giants in the summer of 2020 following the dismissal of Quique Setien on the back of an 8-2 Champions League humbling against Bayern Munich. Koeman ‚Äì who scored the winning goal for Barca in the 1992 European Cup final ‚Äì lasted just 14 months at the helm before being sacked himself, with Joan Laporta bringing in Xavi after seeing the Blaugrana endure considerable financial struggles that led to the departure of Lionel Messi. Former Sweden international striker Larsson, who spent time with Barca as a player between 2004 and 2006, told fotbollskanalen of the era Koeman had to oversee and why he should have been given more time in which to turn a corner: ‚ÄúOf course it was turbulent. ‚ÄúDuring the first season it was all good until March when we lost to Granada at home. After that we felt that there was less support from upstairs, after Laporta became president. And that is how it continued until the summer. We went on our summer holidays and I didn‚Äôt know whether I would carry on the following season. ‚ÄúWe got a decision on that very late. That‚Äôs a shame. For me it doesn‚Äôt matter too much but to treat Ronald Koeman like that, he did not deserve that. After all the work we had done, the clean out that Ronald had done to make things possible, then I don‚Äôt think he deserved not being told [about his future].‚Äù Larsson added on the situation with Messi, which led to the iconic Argentine leaving for Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent after it became apparent that a new contract for the seven-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr could not be funded: ‚ÄúYou never thought that Messi would leave the club and it had an effect on the whole squad. It was a tough time but as a coach you have to try to turn off the outside noise and know that you are there to work. ‚ÄúThere were days when [we] went there and didn‚Äôt know whether it was our last or whether we would continue. That could have been easily avoided but that would have demanded much better leadership than what Laporta showed.‚Äù Larsson spent a lot of his time alongside Koeman working with Barca‚Äôs younger players, with more La Masia academy graduates breaking through in the present alongside some shrewd long-term signings such as Pedri and Ferran Torres. Larsson added on those he helped to nurture, such as Ansu Fati and Nico: ‚ÄúThere were a lot of players Koeman and I promoted to the first team, players who will be great for Barcelona in the future. Ronald did a fantastic job in giving young players a chance. He has given Barcelona a good foundation to build on.‚Äù Koeman did deliver a major honour during his reign ‚Äì the 2021 Copa del Rey ‚Äì and Xavi is still waiting on a first trophy during his spell as boss as Barca look to chase down a Europa League crown and Champions League qualification in 2021-22.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/koeman-deserve-treated-way-he-was-barcelona-larsson/blt0040c181586a6e81,Chris Burton,e98cd841-e725-4583-84c0-aa4e08c0a7e2
Who is Georgina Rodriguez? Everything you need to know about Cristiano Ronaldo's girlfriend,"Cristiano Ronaldo may live most of his life in the public eye, but he has remained relatively secretive about his personal relationships since rising to footballing stardom. The Manchester United forward dated Russian model Irina Shayk for nearly five years until January 2015, when their break-up was described as ""like a death"" in the family by¬†his sister Elma. Ronaldo was linked to a number of women after that, but it became apparent a few years ago that¬†Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez is officially the Portugal captain's partner. They are now very much an item, but if you're wondering who Rodriguez is, here is everything you need to know about Ronaldo's love interest. Georgina Rodriguez is the partner of Al-Nassr and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo. A model and dancer, she is also something of an internet 'influencer', with a formidable social media following, numbering over 44 million followers on Instagram. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, she grew up in the northeastern Spanish city of Jaca. It has a population of just over 13,000 and is near the French border, around 450km from Madrid. She is said to have worked as a waitress in her hometown¬†before moving in with a family in Bristol, England, as an au pair. A post shared by Georgina Rodr√≠guez (@georginagio) on  According to Spanish football newspaper AS, Rodriguez met the Ronaldo at a Gucci store in Madrid, where she was working as a shop assistant. ""His height, his body, his beauty caught my attention. I was trembling in front of him, but a spark ignited,""¬†she said. ""I am very shy and perhaps this stirred me more in front of a person who, with one glance, had touched me deeply.¬†Then after, the way Cristiano treats me, cares for me and loves me did the rest."" The relationship progressed steadily from there,¬†and they started to be snapped by paparazzi together in public in late 2016. Most memorably, Ronaldo was caught in a wig and sunglasses in an attempt to disguise himself¬†during a trip to Disneyland Paris later that year.          About last night ‚ú® Feliz 2020!!!! Mucha salud y mucho amor para todos ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®  A post shared by (@georginagio) on  Rodriguez has since attended Real Madrid, Juventus, Portugal and Manchester United matches. Of course, she has also been¬†part of the family for the FIFA awards, attending the ceremonies¬†with Ronaldo's mother, sisters and son. There was¬†no real announcement of the relationship in photos posted on Ronaldo and¬†Rodriguez's Instagram accounts, but it became plainly evident that they had become an item. This relationship is clearly the most serious Ronaldo has had since breaking up with Irina in 2015, a fact that was profoundly emphasised in 2017 when Georgina gave birth to a baby girl - her first with Ronaldo and the Portugal star's fourth child. In 2021, the couple then announced that they were expecting twins. Georgina also appears to get along well with his son, Cristiano Jr, who Ronaldo has full custody of and cares for with his mother, Dolores. The identity of Cristiano Jr's biological mother has been kept secret since he was born in the United States in 2010. Indeed, Georgina¬†is very much involved with all of Ronaldo's children and is regularly pictured with all of them in seemingly tender¬†moments.¬†          Felices 2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ para m√≠, muy felices. No le puedo pedir m√°s a la vida. Solo much√≠sima salud para mi familia y para m√≠ y poder disfrutarlos siempre. Gracias a todos por vuestras felicitaciones, flores y por tanto amor ‚ú®üíì Y Gracias a mi marido por haberme dado lo mejor de la vida, nuestros hijos. Os amo üíì‚≠êÔ∏è @prettylittlething @cristiano  A post shared by (@georginagio) on  The two have both made clear they are in love, and Georgina even spelled it out on Instagram. She was even there when Ronaldo's yacht was inspected by tax agents in the Balearic Islands, and followed Ronaldo from Madrid to Italy after the forward signed for Juventus, then on to England when he returned to Manchester United and Saudi Arabia following his move to Al-Nassr.

Odegaard admits Arsenal have a mindset problem after throwing away lead against Everton ,"Martin Odegaard says a mental problem cost Arsenal as they lost 2-1 to Everton on Monday. The Norwegian midfielder scored just before half-time to put the Gunners 1-0 up at Goodison Park, but Richarlison and Demarai Gray fired in the second period to secure a first Premier League win since September. Arsenal, meanwhile, have now lost two matches in a row in the English top-flight and Odegaard feels their mentality cost them in the latest upset. ""I think it is [a mindset problem]. When you're leading 1-0 you get afraid to lose the win and in my opinion that's what we did wrong today,‚Äù Odegaard told Sky Sports after the match. ‚ÄúYou go for the second goal and that was the intention, but we didn't manage to do that on the pitch."" He added: ""It's a hard one to take. I think in general we were not at the level we needed to be at today. ""We had some good moments, but we have to do much better. We should have been better. ""It's hard to say. That's just how it is sometimes. It's hard to say exactly what happened. We have to do better when we have that lead. We stopped playing and gave them the game they wanted to play.‚Äù Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was disappointed in his side‚Äôs performance against the Toffees, admitting their use of the ball was not good enough. He told Sky Sports: ""In the first half we were very inconsistent with the ball. I didn't like it. No penetration. One of the few times we did it we scored. Second half we tried to do more of those things, created four big chances but conceded a very sloppy goal when you need to manage the game. ""We couldn't take the ball into the final third. They're not going to give you time, at Goodison you know what to expect. I think the team tried to go, we kept pressing high. We lost a few important duels that put us some pressure.""

Juventus to hold talks over re-signing Pogba and hope to persuade Man Utd midfielder to lower salary demands,"Juventus are gearing up to re-sign Paul Pogba from Manchester United in the summer transfer window and plan to hold talks with his entourage next week. Pogba spent four years in Turin after leaving United on a free transfer in 2012 and is still remembered fondly at the club even after his record ‚Ç¨105¬†million (¬£89.3¬†million) transfer back to Old Trafford. New users can get involved with Boylesports' welcome offer and claim free bets And he may well be returning once again, though Juve are bracing themselves for competition from Paris Saint-Germain for his transfer. GOAL has learned that Juventus are ready to pull out all the stops to sign their former favourite. The club have recently decided to push forward with a move, with plans to make contact with the player's inner circle next week. It is a clear sign that Juve are set on bringing the 29-year-old back to Turin as his United contract enters its final month. The Bianconeri are nevertheless aware that they may not be the only side in the hunt for Pogba this summer. For that reason they have requested that the Pogba team inform them of any other approaches they receive for his services, with a particular eye on PSG's movements. Ultimately it will all come down to the preferences of the player himself, as he prepares to bring an end to his second United spell after six eventful seasons. Pogba is also fond of Juventus and Turin, but his economic demands, estimated at a net annual wage of ‚Ç¨11m (¬£9.3m) and a four-year deal, could prove an obstacle to his arrival. Juve nevertheless hope that his previous history at the club will prompt him to lower his asking price in order to seal a reunion.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-talks-re-signing-pogba-persuade-man-utd-midfielder/blt042783f2e4c8a369,Romeo Agresti,98570f3c-3aaf-4bba-9250-bb28e8406af5
'Anything can happen' - Xavi in the dark over De Jong's future as Man Utd continue to chase Barca talisman,"Barcelona head coach Xavi has admitted that he still does not know if Frenkie de Jong will stay at the club this season as the saga surrounding his future continues. Manchester United have been trying to sign the midfielder throughout the summer transfer window, while Chelsea have also recently been linked with his services. It remains unclear where the Netherlands international will end up and Xavi admits it may take until the final day of the transfer window for his future to become clear. Asked if De Jong could still leave the Camp Nou side this month, the former Blaugrana captain told TV3: ‚ÄúI don't know what will happen with Frenkie de Jong. Until August 31 anything can happen. ‚ÄúHe knows what I think and what the club want and need. Of course I'm counting on him, he's a great player.‚Äù Barcelona are said to be open to selling De Jong because they need to lower their salary expenses and bring in more money amid their ongoing financial struggles. However, president Joan Laporta has insisted throughout the transfer window that he wants the 25-year-old to remain at the Catalan club. He reiterated that stance on Sunday, saying: ‚ÄúFrenkie de Jong is a Barcelona player of great quality and we want him to stay. With him and his team-mates, we have a very powerful midfield. ‚ÄúHe has offers, but we want him to stay and he wants to stay too.‚Äù Despite the player and club's insistence that he will not make a move this year, speculation about De Jong's future continues to circulate. United have been leading the charge to land him since the end of last season, but they are starting to look at alternatives in case they are unable to convince him to move to Old Trafford. GOAL understands that Napoli star Fabian Ruiz is the current leading candidate for the Red Devils should they decide to give up on bringing De Jong to the Premier League. Meanwhile, Chelsea have become involved in the pursuit to sign the ex-Ajax star, according to recent reports, as they look to strengthen under new co-owner Todd Boehly. De Jong has said that he does not want to leave Barca just yet, citing them as his ""dream club"" despite their disappointing performances in recent years. However, the player is also thought to be owed millions in deferred wages by the club, with some reports stating they will have to pay him around ‚Ç¨17m (¬£14m/$17m), which may be another factor in his refusal to leave.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/anything-can-happen-xavi-dark-de-jong-future-man-utd-barca/bltb49b420e4d03801f,Peter McVitie,b39e57e6-82ee-4737-8a60-9499d7538961
'We celebrated like the Carabao Cup!' - Liverpool boss Klopp hails Premier League player of the month Matip,"Jurgen Klopp has hailed Joel Matip after the Liverpool defender was named Premier League player of the month for February. And the Reds boss joked that the celebrations among his squad were comparable to those which followed the club‚Äôs Carabao Cup win last month. Matip has been recognised for his stellar form at the heart of Liverpool‚Äôs defence, following in the footsteps of team-mates Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold in picking up the award this season. Speaking at a press conference ahead of his side‚Äôs weekend trip to Brighton, Klopp paid tribute to the 30-year-old, and revealed just how delighted Matip‚Äôs team-mates had been to hear of the news. He told reporters: ‚ÄúThat was great. Before training, we had a meeting, and Thiago Alcantara had put a picture in the players‚Äô [WhatsApp] group, where he had the trophy in his hand, so I asked ‚Äòis it true that Joel won?‚Äô¬† ‚ÄúIt was similar to the celebrations after the Carabao Cup, to be honest!

The former Schalke man is not someone who would usually command attention, but he is certainly respected by his manager, and among his Anfield colleagues. Klopp said: ‚ÄúJoel is a very famous figure in the group, in the team, and he obviously doesn‚Äôt get a lot of headlines. I don‚Äôt like individual prizes for players too much, but if there was one who should have won it, it makes sense that it was Joel. ‚ÄúWho votes for it? Was it his mum? The Premier League? A panel?

The Senegal international has ended his stay in the Premier League to make a move to the Bundesliga champions, in a switch the latter has suggested will prove an easy task for him with little stakes.

'It's peace' - NWSL secures historic and badly needed CBA agreement after scandal-plagued 2021,"There were rare emotions flowing late Monday evening, feelings that had become maddeningly unfamiliar to anybody invested in the NWSL recently. Positivity. Optimism. Elation. Relief. All the result of the NWSL Players Association (NWSLPA) ratifying its first ever collective bargaining agreement (CBA). ‚ÄúThis makes me feel so warm inside,‚Äù Kaiya McCullough, the ex-player who kicked off a league-wide reckoning last year said on Twitter. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs peace.‚Äù Indeed, the historic CBA averted a work stoppage on the eve of preseason and provided a desperately needed win for the league and its players after an autumn and winter of discontent. ‚ÄúWe want a new, fresh NWSL, and the way to not relive the 2021 season and instead rebuild our league into what we know it can be, is to start from day one with a CBA,‚Äù NWSLPA executive director Meghann Burke told GOAL. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that everyone at the NWSL should be proud of,‚Äù Burke added. ‚ÄúIt took a lot of collective work and effort and I think it really sets the NWSL on a positive trajectory for the future.‚Äù The unprecedented five-year agreement provides an essential level of stability and freedom to the NWSL‚Äôs players, many of whom have suffered indignities no employee ‚Äì whether office worker or world-class athlete ‚Äì should ever experience. The NWSLPA had been pushing for a CBA long before a cascading series of scandals in 2021, but those incidents added a new urgency to negotiations, and shaped what the PA prioritized. ‚ÄúI think the honest answer is that you can't untangle those things,‚Äù Burke said, referring to the reckoning over abuse in 2021 and CBA talks. ‚ÄúThey were absolutely happening at the same time and on the minds of everyone involved.‚Äù Several of the provisions in the new CBA can be viewed as direct responses to the NWSL‚Äôs scandal-plagued 2021. A system of free agency has been introduced and while freedom of movement is something any pro athlete desires, it is especially vital in the NWSL after several players lamented the lack of an escape hatch when playing under abusive coaches. A boost in the minimum salary from $22,000 (¬£16,000) to $35,000 (¬£26,000) provides more financial stability to players on the bottom end of rosters ‚Äì a group who, in several cases, were allegedly targeted by predatory coaches due to their lack of power and influence. And NWSL teams will be required to provide, among other medical personnel, a sports psychologist and team clinician to administer mental health services. Players will also be granted up to six months of paid mental health leave. Burke told GOAL that she believes this provision is the first of its kind in professional sports. ‚ÄúI think [the scandals] helped illustrate in a very human way why free agency was so important, why higher wages were so important, why players having more autonomy and control over their careers was so important,‚Äù Burke said. ‚Äú[Having] up to six months paid mental health leave, there‚Äôs no better way to articulate why that's so important than to understand what happened last year.‚Äù In their press release announcing the deal, the NWSLPA included a poignant message to past players. Some had simply aged out, but others have been forced out due to abuse, inadequate pay, lack of career autonomy or substandard institutional support. ‚ÄúTo the players who came before us: We stand on your shoulders. We hope we made you proud.‚Äù A statement from the Players Association: pic.twitter.com/7piQ0n9i0z Burke, a former pro player herself, said: ‚ÄúWhen we say we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us, it's a metaphor. ""But it's a fact that we would not be here without decades and maybe, if you go back that far, 100 years' worth of work and sacrifice, and players who never got to experience what the future generations will.‚Äù To be clear, the CBA is not some kind of magic elixir that will rid the league of the issues that have plagued it for years. Salaries are up but those on the lower end of the spectrum are still far from financially secure. Free agency provies freedom of movement for some, but not all. Investigations into alleged abuses are ongoing, with few tangible results as of now. There is still a frayed relationship between players and NWSL leadership that won‚Äôt be rebuilt by one CBA agreement. But suffice it to say, the last thing a beleaguered NWSL needed was a players‚Äô strike to kick off a 2022 campaign during which it hopes to begin a long healing process. For the first time in a while, there is optimism about where the league is going.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nwsl-secures-historic-badly-needed-cba-agreement/blt6f04a453d612bf6d,Seth Vertelney,34b6ac9d-7183-4992-bab8-8c25c27a8f59
Abraham reacts to Chelsea buyback clause and Premier League transfer links after 27-goal season at Roma,"Tammy Abraham is in ‚Äúno hurry to return to the Premier League‚Äù amid talk of interest from Manchester United and Arsenal, while the Roma striker is also paying no attention to the buyback clause Chelsea could look to trigger in 2023. For now, the England international is focused on building on a productive debut campaign in Italy. The 24-year-old hit 27 goals last season following a ‚Ç¨40 million (¬£34m/$41m) transfer to Italy, with Europa Conference League glory also savoured under Jose Mourinho, with those exploits attracting admiration from his homeland. Abraham told Corriere dello Sport of the transfer talk he has been generating: ‚ÄúThe first day I arrived at Roma I felt at home. ‚ÄúI'm in no hurry to return to the Premier League because here I can express my way of playing.

They have allowed Romelu Lukaku to return to Inter on loan, with the Belgian deemed surplus to requirements, and that may tempt them into the market for another No 9 in 12 months‚Äô time. On Chelsea‚Äôs buyback clause, Abraham said: ‚ÄúBelieve me, I don't think about the future, but about the present. ‚ÄúI focus exclusively on the season that is about to begin, because I want it to be even more rewarding than the first I experienced in Italy.‚Äù Pressed further on whether he has ever regretted severing ties with Premier League heavyweights from Stamford Bridge, Abraham added: ‚ÄúNever, not even for a second.

Scholes eviscerates Man Utd's Rangnick appointment with 'six games' comment after Atletico Madrid defeat,"Paul Scholes has taken aim at Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick, questioning how the club ever thought hiring the German boss could be a good idea. Rangnick was appointed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's temporary successor, with the former RB Leipzig architect handed the reins until the end of the season until he moves into an advisory role. But, after Tuesday's loss to Atletico Madrid that sealed the club's Champions League elimination, Manchester United legend Scholes didn't hold back in his assessment of the manager. ""How [Rangnick] was chosen to be manager of this club, I don't know,"" Scholes said on BT Sport.  ""Getting a proper coach for this team is a massive thing. There's some real talent in this squad.  ""The very first thing this club needs to do to get anywhere near winning the league again is getting in a proper coach who works for this team.""  He added: ""I don't know how this man was chosen to be manager of Manchester United. Not for six months, not for six weeks, not for six games."" Even before kickoff, Scholes was talking up the importance of bringing in the right manager when Rangnick ultimately steps aside. The former midfielder earmarked two current Premier League managers while explaining the key factor in what will make the club's next coach successful or not. ""I would have gone for [Antonio]Conte or [Thomas] Tuchel,"" Scholes said. ""It looks like one might be available at the end of the season.  ""Those are two top-class coaches that strike fear into players and win, which is the most important thing. United, with either one of those managers, would be much better off. ""You need a manager that strikes fear into players, Sir Alex Ferguson had that, have any of the managers since him had that? I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs a special talent to have as a coach.  ""Those Man City players under Pep [Guardiola], those Liverpool players under [Jurgen]Klopp, they‚Äôll get away with nothing. These players here for the last two or three years have got away with murder.  ""I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôll catch Man City or Liverpool.

'First time I've seen 5-5-0!' - De Bruyne on Atletico Madrid tactics as Savic promises they will 'go to score goals' in second leg vs Man City,"Kevin De Bruyne says that Atletico Madrid's ""5-5-0"" formation was the time he's ever seen a team set up like that, with Stefan Savic promising the Spanish giants will ""go to score goals"" in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie. City will take a narrow 1-0 lead to Wanda Metropolitano after a frustrating first leg at Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night that saw them struggle to break down Atletico's stubborn rearguard. De Bruyne's 70th-minute strike ended up being the difference between the two sides, but he expressed his frustration over the visitors' set-up after the final whistle. ""Teams play very defensively [against us] but today, for the first time, I see a team playing 5-5-0,"" the Belgium international told TNT Sports. ""No strikers. So it's very hard to find the spaces."" De Bruyne added: ""In the second half we had more chances and luckily we scored one, but we also didn't give anything away and in that aspect, we played a really good game."" City boss Pep Guardiola echoed the midfielder's sentiments in his post-match press conference, adding: ""We sensed that they would play 5-3-2, then they adjusted and they became 5-5.  ""In prehistory, today and in a hundred thousand years it is very difficult to attack a 5-5, there are no spaces."" Atletico didn't record a single shot at goal over the course of the 90 minutes as the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Joao Felix spent most of the evening pressing while City dominated possession. Savic shone in the heart of Diego Simeone's defence, and felt their gameplan was successful despite the defeat. ‚ÄúWe never like to lose.¬†We're not happy because we lost, but in the end it's not a bad result, we played at¬†City's home and they didn't have so many clear chances,"" the Atletico centre-half told Movistar. ""They had possession but I think we lacked a bit of legs in the final third, we had some attacks with¬†Griezmann¬†or¬†Joao¬†that we could have finished better.¬†I'm calm because we have 90 minutes left in our stadium."" Savic also promised that Atletico will be more adventurous in the return leg as they seek to turn the contest around and reach the last four. ‚ÄúWhen you defend so low it's not easy to get out, we had two or three [counter-attacks] that we could have done better with, but we lacked legs,"" he said. ""At home it will be different, we have different needs, like scoring goals and we will go to score goals.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/5-5-0-de-bruyne-atletico-madrid-tactics-savic-promises-goals/blt6cfc1359a3df5814,James Westwood,e5c8cb6f-9b4f-49a3-b38e-18c7cc9169fc
Mourinho blasted by Lazio after Roma boss suggests Acerbi scored 'offside goal' in Spezia win,"Roma manager Jose Mourinho has criticised rivals Lazio after they scored a winner in a Serie A match from an offside position - with the Rome club responding to the coach in equally strong terms. Mourinho's ire was drawn by Lazio defender Francesco Acerbi scoring in the 90th minute against Spezia to seal a 4-3 victory, as he angrily claimed that across his two decades in coaching ""you can still win with an offside goal"". Lazio have struck back, releasing a statement in which they criticise Mourinho - albeit without naming him - for trying ""to divert attention from missed results and sensational episodes that have occurred in one's own home."" The Portuguese coach was annoyed by journalists' questions after Roma's 0-0 draw with Bologna on Sunday, a result which means they can no longer finish in the Serie A top four and qualify for the Champions League. He said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been coaching 22 years and everything stays the same. A lot of things change in football, but you [the media], don‚Äôt. ‚ÄúAfter each game there are questions and comments, in 22 years that‚Äôs one of the few things that haven‚Äôt changed. ‚ÄúAnother thing that hasn‚Äôt changed is that 22 years ago you could have won a game with an offside goal and 22 years later you can still win with an offside goal. Yesterday a team [Lazio] won with a goal from offside. Think about it.‚Äù The Serie A club released a lengthy and furious statement on Monday morning in response to Mourinho, while also taking wild aim at perceived media bias against Lazio, and other decisions which they feel have gone against them this campaign. It read: ""The fact that in 2022 a coach of another team, during his press conferences, repeatedly refers to presumed referee favours for competing teams... demonstrates some things. ""That Lazio is obsessively in their thoughts more than other coveted professional goals; that, as often happens, one looks into other people's homes to divert attention from missed results and sensational episodes that have occurred in one's own home. ""That despite the need to evolve the image of football in Italy, some players are stuck with the constant repetition of the accusations against the referees and the VAR; that these offensive attitudes towards the referee category and the lack of journalistic objectivity are too often overlooked. ""Lazio rejects the criticisms and insinuations, it continues to believe that values ‚Äã‚Äãare demonstrated on the pitch and not in the television studios. Lazio will never lend itself to being anyone's alibi or scapegoat and will assert itself in the appropriate forums. ""The club's line continues to be that of not discussing the decisions taken on the pitch, even when it comes to obvious episodes that occurred to the detriment of the Biancoceleste team, such as Tonali's foul on Acerbi in Lazio v Milan on the occasion of the goal, or the elbow in Ibanez area on Milinkovic in the return derby, just to name two even if we have many others. ""Decisive episodes on which we have chosen silence out of respect for the referees on the field and the VAR, respect that others have not shown and continue not to demonstrate.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-lazio-roma-acerbi-offside-goal-spezia/blt2cf1c644631c0e81,Emma Smith,2519fcad-2e5f-4441-b88b-8bcd1ae8dabd
Tottenham open to selling Dele and Lo Celso after omitting midfield duo from squad to face Chelsea,"Tottenham are open to selling both Dele Alli and Giovani Lo Celso in the final days of the January transfer window, with both players omitted from the matchday squad for their derby clash with Chelsea on Sunday, GOAL understands. Both men have been linked with the exit door at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium under Antonio Conte, with the duo's absence from their vital clash with the Blues at Stamford Bridge the latest indicator that their time with the Lilywhites may be up. Both players have cut peripheral figures under the Italian and ahead of this weekend's game, Lo Celso further confirmed that his absence was not injury-related, adding fuel to the fire that his days - and those of his team-mate - are numbered. ""Regarding the questions I received, I would like to clear out that I am 100 per cent in good physical condition,"" the Argentine wrote on his Instagram story shortly ahead of kick-off. ""I have no problem and I feel very well. I wish the best to my team in the derby today."" Lo Celso's words were emblazoned over an image of him and several team-mates laughing together amid a training session. Conte was asked about Alli's future after his side's 2-0 defeat at Chelsea on Sunday, but he refused to say what lies in store for the England international. He said to Sky Sports: ""I don't want to comment on single players. There is the club to make the best decision. There is a sporting director and chairman and they take the last decision."" The Italian coach chose not to address the likelihood of new players coming in before the transfer window closes and insists his team's problems cannot be solved just by transfers. ""This is not the right moment to speak, the club know very well what I think,"" he said. ""There is not one transfer market to close the gap. The last few years this gap became very big and now it is not simple to find a solution in a short time. ""I am only focused to work until the end, we have four months to try and give everything, but if we think we solve with the transfer market the situation, it is not the reality. You need many years, but for sure we have to start. ""You have to sell or loan players and it is difficult and then you have to find the right players for you. You can only start this process but you need many years. It won't be easy, I spoke with the club and am totally in this position of the club to work and improve the situation on the pitch. ""I am enjoying my time in Tottenham, we have four months to work and get the best possible result. I am proud of the effort. Sometimes you can push 100% but it is not enough."" Since the forrmer Chelsea boss returned to the Premier League to succeed Nuno Espirito Santo following a rough start to the new campaign, Tottenham have undergone a clear identity shift to suit their new manager. But it has apparently spelled the end for players like Lo Celso, Alli and Tanguy Ndombele, with the latter's tenure as a club-record signing also likely to end this month before the window closes. The latter looks poised to head back to France, where he originally signed from, with Paris Saint-Germain mooted to be considering a loan swoop for his services - though countryman Hugo Lloris will not join him at the exit, having penned fresh terms in north London.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tottenham-open-to-selling-dele-and-lo-celso-after-omitting/blt1b946472d8f12b9a,Nizaar Kinsella,ae77e443-bd5a-4555-a1a6-45e3b782328a
Guardiola: Manchester City must 'be ourselves' to beat Real Madrid in Champions League,"Manchester City need to be ""exceptional"" in both games against Real Madrid to have any chance of beating them in the Champions League semi-finals says Pep Guardiola, as he urged his side to stick to their regular playing style. The Premier League leaders host the Spanish side for the first leg of their last-four tie on Tuesday. City got the better of Madrid when they met in the round of 16 in the competition in the 2019-20 campaign, going through 4-2 on aggregate. Guardiola expects the clashes to be tight affairs this time around too, but feels his side need to be themselves to have a chance of reaching the final. ""Listen, this competition we went through against Real Madrid but it was a tight two games,"" he said at a press conference. ""We went out in the quarter finals in other years when it was tight too. The reality is in the last decade we are already there, fighting for the Champions League, the group stage go through and arrive in the semi-finals.  ""It's nice to be in the process. Always I had the feeling in Barcelona and [at Bayern] Munich and now here, we arrived here [in the semi-finals] and I started to expect to be here.  ""For me, always I had the feeling right now we‚Äôve been a few times in the that position, how nice it is, to be there with the best teams in the world and Europe.  ""Now we try to be ourselves and compete well. We‚Äôll need two exceptional games to reach the final and hopefully we can do it.  ""It's not necessary to say much much we respect Real Madrid, how good they are. That's all. It‚Äôs an honour.  ""We want to get to the final and win the final, like Madrid, like Villarreal and like Liverpool. At the same time, I‚Äôll never underestimate what we‚Äôve done in being here. Never ever."" Guardiola has a selection issue heading into the tie at Etihad Stadium. Joao Cancelo is suspended for the match, while Kyle Walker and John Stones are doubts as they continue to recover from injuries. The lack of options at right-back resulted in suggestions that striker Gabriel Jesus could be called on to fill the position, but Guardiola has dismissed such talk. He said: ""[Stones and Walker] are doubts, Kyle didn't train for the last 10 days, John since Brighton. That's why, I don't know if they will train. We see how they feel, tomorrow take a decision. ""Jesus is not going to play right back! I expect that he could. Vinicius Junior against Gabriel could be a good battle but he won't play there. Maybe for a few minutes, but no.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-man-city-be-ourselves-real-madrid-champions-league/blt113cecd9146bed17,Peter McVitie,c6f8338b-841f-4577-bcf9-cd92b1972697
Napoli star Osimhen's agent dismisses talk of Ronaldo swap deal,"WHAT HAPPENED? As Ronaldo continues to pursue a move away from Manchester United, reports in Italy claimed his agent Jorge Mendes was attempting to broker a swap deal with Napoli which would see Osimhen go the other way. Although, the agent of the Nigeria striker, Roberto Calenda, quickly shot down those claims. WHAT HE SAID: Osimhen's agent took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to address the rumours. He wrote: ""No negotiations in progress, no exchanges. ""Victor Osimhen is a Napoli player and wants to play the Champions League with Napoli after winning it [qualification] on the pitch with pride together with the coach and teammates."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: If there is no substance behind rumours linking Manchester United with Osimhen, it leaves the Red Devils scrambling to sign a striker. It is hardly an ideal position for Erik ten Hag to find himself in given there are just a few days left of the transfer window. IN THREE PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR MAN UTD? It is all getting a little bit desperate for Manchester United with the transfer window moving into its final few days. It seems very unlikely that Ronaldo will be going anywhere but that might not affect Ten Hag's pursuit of another striker.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/napoli-star-osimhen-s-agent-dismisses-talk-of-ronaldo-swap/bltc9c20085e7e721aa,Ed Mackey,1d0c977e-3e24-4ee2-8164-2d8d0210967c
Casemiro escapes yellow despite series of fouls as Real Madrid and Manchester City clash,"Real Madrid star Casemiro escaped punishment despite throwing his weight around on more than one occasion during Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Manchester City.  The Brazilian is known for living dangerously with his physical style of play in the middle of the pitch.  He was lucky not to receive at least one booking after a series of conspicuous fouls.  The midfielder was in the thick of things throughout the opening half, which ended 0-0 to leave Man City ahead on aggregate, but two fouls in particular could have invited further sanction.  Phil Foden saw his shirt almost ripped off his back as he tried to slip away from his marker.  Casemiro also scythed down Kevin de Bruyne from behind in a challenge that certainly seemed to warrant a booking. The Brazilian was eventually replaced with 15 minutes remaining, after Riyad Mahrez opened the scoring and Madrid needed to chase the game, somehow ending his evening without his name in the referee's book.

"Arsenal's 'Saka and Emile Smith Rowe' chant: Lyrics to Gunners fans' song, video and meaning explained","Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe have emerged as key players for Arsenal as well as England, with the pair earning plenty of admiration among the Emirates Stadium faithful as products of the Gunners' youth system. Their performances and link-up play have inspired Arsenal fans to add another chant to their long-standing songbook, with a Status Quo classic providing the backing tune for a terrace favourite. So what are the lyrics to the 'Saka and Emile Smith Rowe' song? And where did it come from? GOAL brings you all the details. Here we go, oh!Saka and Emile Smith Rowe!And I like it,I like it,I like it,I like it,I la-la-like it,La-la, like it,Here we go, oh!Saka and Emile Smith Rowe! Arsenal fans have laid their own lyrics for the 'Saka and Emile Smith Rowe' chant over the tune of Status Quo's 1970s hit 'Rockin' All Over the World'. Listen to the song in the video below. The 'Saka and Emile Smith Rowe' song is a feel-good celebration of two Arsenal youth products and the excitement that is caused when they are playing for the Gunners. Those who delve into the lyrics seeking a deep meaning will be left disappointed, as the message behind the song is simply that Arsenal fans love seeing Saka and Emile Smith Rowe star for their club. üé∂ Here we goooo‚Ä¶ üé∂ pic.twitter.com/OncoBQn8G2 ""They love that song and everybody loves that song because they are players who have been raised in our system,"" said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta when asked about the tune. The song has ultimately been a hit among fans and the players are also delighted to have their own chant, as they follow the likes of Arsenal heroes 'Rocky' Rocastle and Jack Wilshere, who famously had songs penned for them.  ""I don't sing it at home, but I think it's getting more and more viral.

Minamino 2.0? Why Yuito Suzuki could be the next Japanese star to shine in Europe,"It‚Äôs fair to say that Japanese footballers have been making a big impression in Europe of late. From Takumi Minamino to Takehiro Tomiyasu, the veteran Maya Yoshida at Sampdoria and the impressive Takefuso Kubo at Mallorca, to the exciting quartet of new arrivals at Celtic, the J-League is increasingly well-represented among the continent‚Äôs top leagues. How long, one wonders, before the name Yuito Suzuki is added to the list? The 20-year-old, who plays for Shimizu S-Pulse, has already been attracting interest from clubs in both Belgium and Scotland, and is likely to make the move to Europe at some point this year. He has already earned his first call-up for the national team, training alongside the likes of Minamino and Kubo ahead of last month‚Äôs World Cup qualifiers against China and Saudi Arabia.  ‚ÄúAn honour,‚Äù he called it, although he did not feature in the games as it turned out. A skilful, versatile attacker, Suzuki idolises Kevin De Bruyne, the Manchester City star, and has been compared to Minamino on account of his dynamism, quick feet and eye for a pass.  Like the Liverpool man, he is capable of playing anywhere across the forward line, or as the third midfielder in a 4-3-3, though he views the ‚Äòsecond striker‚Äô position as his most comfortable. ""My strength is that I can play in any [attacking] position,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat is required of me is to receive the ball in the gaps of the opponents and link it to the attack."" ‚öΩÔ∏è HIGHLIGHT ‚öΩÔ∏è Meiji Yasuda J1 League Match Day 1 S-Pulse 1-1 Hokkaido Consadole SapporoOur 2nd half equaliser.

I want people to see that my finishing in front of goal has improved this season.‚Äù Born in the town of Hayama, in the Kanagawa region of Japan, Suzuki was initially on the books of Yokohama F Marinos as a youngster, but chose Shimizu, he says, because of ‚Äúthe atmosphere within the club‚Äù and because it has a reputation for producing good footballers.  Shinji Okazaki, a Premier League winner with Leicester, is among those to have emerged with S-Pa, who have also housed the likes of Freddie Ljungberg, Daniele Massaro and the great Brazilian showman Djalminha down the years. Suzuki shares an agent with Minamino, who made the move to the Premier League with Liverpool a little over two years ago, and is keen to follow the example set by him and Tomiyasu, who joined Arsenal from Bologna last summer.  The importance of role models, he says, is huge. He hopes to be involved when Japan take on Australia in a huge World Cup qualifier in Sydney next month. Victory there would secure the Samurai Blue‚Äôs place in Qatar, while defeat would leave them needing to beat Vietnam in their final match, while hoping the Socceroos fail to defeat Saudi Arabia in theirs. In the meantime, the focus will be on performing consistently for Shimizu S-Pulse, who finished 14th in the J-League last season but have greater ambitions this time around under Hiroaki Hiraoki, who replaced Miguel Angel Lotina, the former Villarreal, Espanyol and Real Sociedad boss, in November. Deliver there, and Europe surely beckons for Suzuki.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/minamino-yuito-suzuki-next-japanese-star-europe/bltbae9651349479265,Neil Jones,199b2fb3-2487-454a-a5a1-4458af94bdd6
Ansu says Xavi has changed Barca's 'mindset' as he gives update on injury recovery,"Barcelona forward Ansu Fati says he is relishing the chance to return from injury and play under former player Xavi at the club, stating that the Spaniard has brought ""a different mindset"" to the squad. The Blaugrana have enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in form since they sacked Ronald Koeman last autumn, with the club seemingly now free of the post-Lionel Messi shackles that dragged them down across the start of the season. With European honours still in the mix and a top four finish looking likely at home, Fati is relishing the chance to return to action, and suggests that he will be back soon to play under Xavi's new-look command. ""I‚Äôm really looking forward to it because the team has improved a lot,"" the teenager told press at the launch of his new book Solidarity Stories of Sport. ""The team is playing very well. I hope I can be with the team soon.‚Äù ""The change of coach has been very good for us, the players now have a different mindset of hard work and you can already see the results."" One of the Blaugrana's all-time most decorated stars during his playing days, the former midfielder has revived their struggling fortunes after taking the reins from Koeman. Having been languishing in ninth and with a Champions League exit looming in November, he has lost just four games in charge to steer them to second in La Liga and into the throes of a Europa League silverware battle too.

'Nketiah can make Arsenal shirt his own if he does exactly what Arteta wants' - Mills challenges Ghana target,"Ex-England international Danny Mills has challenged Eddie Nketiah to give his best in training and stick to the instructions given to stand a better chance of becoming a regular at Arsenal. The 22-year-old has struggled for game time at the club but played an important role as the Gunners claimed 4-2 and 3-1 wins over Chelsea and Manchester United, respectively, in their last two Premier League matches.  The match against the Blues was Nketiah's second start this season, and he went on to score a brace. In his interview with Football Insider, Mills said the Ghanaian prospect has what it takes to excel at a high level, but cast doubt on the youngster's attitude in training. ""We have seen that he can score goals, but there‚Äôs obviously a reason why he doesn‚Äôt get a lot of game time,"" the now 44-year-old said in a recent interview. ""He came to Leeds [United on loan] and didn‚Äôt get much, and he has had a couple of managers at Arsenal too. You have to ask the question of his performances in training ‚Äì is he really doing all that he can? ""If you give him the opportunity, he can be brilliant in front of goal. That‚Äôs not hard to see. I think he just needs to knuckle down in training now, work a little bit harder ‚Äì and look at his weaknesses. ""He can make the shirt his own if he can do exactly what the manager wants of him."" Nketiah has made 16 appearances for the Gunners in the English top-tier this season, scoring twice and assisting once. From his display in the club's last two matches, Mikel Arteta might consider giving him a starting role in the London Derby away to West Ham United this weekend.

Sancho hopeful Man Utd career 'will take off soon' as he eyes fresh start under Ten Hag,"Jadon Sancho says he is hopeful that his Manchester United career ""will take off soon"" as he eyes a fresh start at Old Trafford under incoming head coach Erik ten Hag. Sancho completed a long-awaited ¬£73 million ($90m) move to United from Borussia Dortmund last summer, bringing to an end his successful four-year stay in Germany. The 22-year-old committed to a five-year deal with the Red Devils, but has endured a frustrating debut season that has largely seen him fail to justify his hefty price tag. Ten Hag will replace interim boss Ralf Rangick in the Old Trafford dugout this summer, and Sancho is optimistic that he can fulfil his potential under the Dutchman and help United return to the elite stage. Asked to discuss his short-term goals in Manchester, the England international told Premier League Productions: ""To start again fresh, with a new manager coming in, we‚Äôre looking forward to seeing what his ideas and plans for the team are. ""You only have to think positively. My career is only getting started and, hopefully, it will take off soon. This has been a difficult season, especially being a Manchester United player, with what the club has achieved over the years. ""United is known for winning trophies and being up there with the best. This season has been a difficult one for all of us, but I think we still have to show belief again.""¬† Sancho has appeared in 38 games across all competitions for the Red Devils to date, recording just five goals and three assists as Rangnick's side have slipped out of the Premier League's top four while suffering early exits in both domestic cups and the Champions League. The former Dortmund star has shown flashes of brilliance but consistency has proved elusive, and he has been sidelined in recent weeks due to a bout of tonsillitis. It is not yet known whether Sancho will be available for United's final game of 2021-22, which will see them take in a trip to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sancho-hopeful-man-utd-career-will-take-off-fresh-start/bltb155f0ca61e15df5,James Westwood,f37ebf91-acda-4c20-9f62-3de86e9e1940
2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Rangers‚Äô Bassey calls for focus ahead of ‚Äòmassive‚Äô Ghana clash,"Calvin Bassey has urged his Nigeria teammates to stay focused ahead of Friday‚Äôs 2022 Fifa World Cup qualification play-off against Ghana. The Super Eagles are eyeing a place in the global football showpiece for the seventh time, however, they must negotiate their way past eternal rivals, the Black Stars. All eyes will be on Baba Yara Stadium, Kumasi for the first leg, before both teams fly to the MKO Abiola Stadium for the reverse fixture - with the winners on aggregate earning a ticket to Qatar 2022. Having in mind what is at stake against Otto Addo‚Äôs men, the Rangers defender - who could make his international debut against Ghana - wants his teammates to stay energised for the blockbuster fixture.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a massive game. I‚Äôm just focusing on how I can help the team, focus on what to do, what I need to do and my roles are going to be,‚Äù Bassey told NFF TV ‚ÄúThe biggest thing is to get focused and get locked in because It is going to be a test. We¬† know they are a good team, we also have good players and a good team.‚Äù Since their first meeting in this competition on August 28, 1960 - where Nigeria bowed 4-1 in Accra - the two nations have met on the football field on seven occasions, with the Super Eagles winning twice. The Ghanaians have had the upper hand in two fixtures while the remaining four have ended in draws. Echoing this optimism is coach Augustine Eguavoen, who is satisfied with the Super Eagles‚Äô performance in training on Tuesday evening. ‚ÄúI am very satisfied, you can see that the boys are ready to go,‚Äù he told the media. ‚ÄúThe good thing is that they are in season, they are in form and their confidence is very high.

Kenya and Zimbabwe kicked out of 2023 Africa Cup of Nations,"Kenya and Zimbabwe will not participate in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, the Confederation of African football has confirmed. Although the race for Cote d‚ÄôIvoire commences in June, the Harambee Stars and Warriors are unable to take part because Fifa‚Äôs ban on them has not been lifted. The East and Southern African countries had been included in the draw for the African football showpiece on the condition that their suspension must be lifted two weeks before their first match. ‚ÄúAs a consequence of having failed to have their suspensions by Fifa set aside, Caf has confirmed that both Kenya and Zimbabwe will not participate in the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations Cote d‚ÄôIvoire 2023 qualifiers,‚Äù a statement on the Caf website read. ‚ÄúThe qualifiers will kick off on the first day of June 2022.¬† ‚ÄúCaf had included them in the official draw earlier in April 2022 on the condition that the suspension must be lifted two weeks before their first match day.¬† ‚ÄúKenya and Zimbabwe, suspended for political interference, have not yet met the criteria required by the Fifa congress as a prerequisite for lifting their suspension.‚Äù Kenya‚Äôs suspension was ratified during Fifa‚Äôs 72nd congress held on March 31, 2022, in Doha, Qatar. 198 members voted to support the sanction of the decision by the global football governing body, while only one voted against the motion. ""The Fifa council suspended Kenya on February 24th with immediate effect due to third party interference, in particular, the takeover of football by a caretaker committee appointed by the government, which is a serious violation of the Fifa statutes,"" Fifa president Gianni Infantino had announced. ""It is therefore recommended that the congress confirm the suspension of the Football Kenya Federation, enabling the council to lift the suspension immediately and as soon as the pertinent requirements have been fulfilled.""

Man Utd icon Rooney: Pogba should probably transfer elsewhere,"Manchester United icon Wayne Rooney has said that it is probably time for Paul Pogba to find a new club. The Red Devils' record signing returned to Old Trafford to much fanfare in 2016, but has thus far failed to live up to his lofty price tag with inconsistent displays. And with the France international's contract set to run out in the summer, Rooney feels it's time for the 29-year-old to move on. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs got to the point now where it‚Äôs probably better if he moves on,‚Äù Rooney told Sky Sports. ‚ÄúIf Paul is honest with himself, he's probably not had the impact he would have liked since he returned.  ‚ÄúI watch him play for France and it‚Äôs a completely different player. His ability, his vision, control of the game is there in every game for France.  ‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt quite worked for him at Manchester United and I think there‚Äôs a few players they need to let go.‚Äù Pressed on why it hasn't worked out for Pogba at Old Trafford, Rooney added: ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a settled manager since Alex Ferguson. So whoever comes in, they (the board) need to give him time to build up relationships with players.‚Äù Man Utd are in the market for a new head coach at the end of the season, with Ralf Rangnick currently filling an interim position at the club. Rooney has given former Spurs and current PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino his backing over Ajax's Erik ten Hag, although stressed again that whoever comes in will need time to stamp their authority and vision on the club. ‚ÄúFor managers now, they need time to put their blueprint on the club. If you give him time he‚Äôd do well.

"Dyche sacking has 'ripped the heart' from Burnley, says Crouch","Peter Crouch, who brought the curtain down on his career at Burnley, says the decision to sack Sean Dyche has ‚Äúripped the heart‚Äù out of a side that is still sweating on its Premier League status in 2021-22. The Clarets have, with seven games left to take in this season, parted company with a manager who was the longest-serving in the English top-flight and one that had led them to two previous promotions. Many have questioned why action has been taken now, with Dyche delivering on his remit for the best part of 10 years, and Crouch is of the opinion that those at Turf Moor may live to regret a hasty call in the dugout. Burnley are running out of time in which to steer a course to safety, as they sit three points adrift of 17th-placed Everton while also playing a game more, but ex-Clarets striker Crouch has told the Daily Mail: ‚ÄúI worked with Sean Dyche for the final six months of my career and was in shock at Burnley‚Äôs decision to sack him late last week. ‚ÄúThe heart is being ripped out of that club, with Ian Woan, Billy Mercer and Steve Stone all leaving too. These are good people. Sean Dyche has been sacked by Burnley after ten years with the club ‚ùåHe was the Premier League's longest serving manager ü§ù pic.twitter.com/hXgGvlHgJe ‚ÄúThey could have come straight back up with Sean. Who else would you rather have in charge in the Championship? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs barely had any money over the last 10 years ‚Äî the sum total is akin to the finance some rivals spend in one transfer window alone. ‚ÄúTo have what he has achieved disregarded makes me worry about the decision-making process at Turf Moor. I feared for Burnley when ALK Capital took over the club last year and the moves they have made since confirm that.‚Äù Whoever is drafted in to replace Dyche, with Mike Jackson currently in caretaker charge, is going to have to make an immediate impact. Burnley will, after seeing Ashley Westwood suffer a horror injury in a 1-1 draw at West Ham last time out, be back in action on Thursday when playing host to Southampton.

Sterling was a Man City legend ‚Äì so why has Guardiola let him join Chelsea?!,"Raheem Sterling leaves Manchester City as a club legend. The medals alone suggest as much: four Premier League titles, five League Cups, one FA Cup, and a Champions League runners-up medal. In a period of unprecedented success for the club under Pep Guardiola, no one played more minutes ‚Äì only Sergio Aguero has scored more goals and only Kevin de Bruyne has more assists. And, at 27, a player of such footballing intelligence and maturity should be hitting the peak of his powers. So, why did City agree to sell him ‚Äì and to one of their biggest rivals in Chelsea? Timing is, of course, crucial and with 12 months remaining on his contract, this was the last summer City had to cash in on the England international. Despite suggesting he would like to play abroad in the future, there was no suggestion that Europe's biggest clubs could match the offer from new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly, who was determined to make a statement signing to herald the dawn of a new era at Stamford Bridge. The ¬£47.5 million ($57m) transfer fee represents good value for a player that could have left for nothing next summer, and means they've covered nearly all of their original investment in Sterling, who arrived from Liverpool in 2015. pic.twitter.com/3bFDyU5E03 It's worth remembering that plenty of pundits felt that City had overpaid, and feared that he would prove worth neither the money nor the hassle. His Liverpool exit had been far from cordial, after all, and both Sterling and his agent were criticised for the way in which they handled the whole affair. This latest exit, at least, has gone much more smoothly, although there were signs in recent months that the attacker was no longer happy at the Etihad. ""If there was the option to go somewhere else for more game time, I would be open to it,"" Sterling said in October 2021. Guardiola was obviously never going to give Sterling, or any player for that matter, guarantees over game time. Still, there was never any chance of Sterling downing tools and he continued to make an impact on the pitch, helping City complete another successful title defence. While the club would have been happy for him to sign a new contract, the message was clear that any minutes on the pitch would have to be earned, with the competition for places only set to intensify next season. Indeed, the belated arrival of a proven, world-class centre-forward in Erling Haaland, coupled with the signing of potential star Julian Alvarez, meant that there would have been far fewer chances for Sterling to play through the middle in 2022-23. Furthermore, even accounting for the departure of Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal, City are will stocked when it comes to wide attackers. Riyad Mahrez has been one of Guardiola's best players for a few seasons now, Jack Grealish is expected to make a much bigger impact in his second season at the Etihad, while there is legitimate excitement surrounding the emergence of academy graduate Cole Palmer. ‚ÄúWhen you get the opportunity to play, show me [you deserve to play],‚Äù Guardiola said about team selection shortly after Sterling's comments. ‚ÄúShow the world how wrong I was when I was not selecting you. ‚ÄúThe best [players] speak on the pitch. I was a manager with incredible top players, and they never, never, never complained to me. ""So, go out there and show me how wrong I was when I wasn‚Äôt selecting you. They need to show me how good they are. ""The best athletes in the world, in all sports, they do their talking on the field or in the court. That is where they have to talk.‚Äù However, with a World Cup coming up at the end of the year and the England team at its most unstable for some time after a string of poor results, Sterling understandably wants to be playing regularly. And, in 2021-22, he made fewer starts and more substitute appearances than in of any of his previous seven seasons in Manchester. Gallingly for Sterling, he was often benched for City's most important matches. Indeed, he saw just over an hour action across the two legs of the Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid and the final two Premier League matches of the season. Talks with Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel have satisfied Sterling that he will be a key player at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea's forward-line is undergoing an overhaul ‚Äì Romelu Lukaku has already gone, Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi's futures are uncertain and Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner and Kai Havertz have all struggled, either for form or fitness, or both. Tuchel wants forwards who can not only score goals, but also play the intense pressing football that has been so successful at City, and Sterling knows it inside out. England's biggest clubs rarely do business with one another and it feels like both are taking a calculated risk here with Sterling. City will be happy to bank a sizeable amount of cash to reinvest elsewhere, and are offloading a player whose influence has been steadily declining over the past two seasons. Chelsea, meanwhile, are signing an England international with a long and proven track record of scoring goals at the very highest level. For Sterling personally, this move represents a chance to reset and reinvigorate in the city where he grew up and first fell in love with the game. What happens next could be one of the most intriguing storylines of the new season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sterling-man-city-legend-why-joining-chelsea/bltce1495641f00cbdb,Jonathan Smith,b91cc443-0bc8-4c5d-b07a-923f4dd15729
Chelsea loanee Colwill addresses John Terry comparisons and insists he is 'ready' to play in Premier League,"Chelsea youngster and NXGN star Levi Colwill says he welcomes comparisons to John Terry, but isn't going to think about them as he concentrates on his own game. The 19-year-old, who ranked 32nd in GOAL's 2022 list of the 50 best wonderkids in world football, has hugely impressed on loan at Championship side Huddersfield as they push for promotion to the Premier League. A ball-playing centre back who came through the Chelsea academy, Colwill has inevitably been compared to former club captain Terry, but while he is flattered by comparisons, he won't be paying them much mind. Colwill told The Athletic: ""I‚Äôm not going to complain. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to be called the new John Terry. ""I haven‚Äôt made the comparison myself so the fans and media can make whatever comparisons they want to make, it isn‚Äôt going to affect me. ""John Terry is a club legend and leader, someone every centre-back at Chelsea should look up to. A great guy and player. I've not had the chance to speak to him too much. When he was around the academy building we‚Äôd have the odd little chat but it‚Äôd be more of a, ‚ÄòHi, how are you?‚Äô, kind of thing, not on a personal level about football or things like that."" Colwill has also drawn attention for choosing the number 26 while at Huddersfield, the same as Terry wore throughout his Chelsea career as he led the club to Premier League and Champions League glory. However Colwill says this is not a tribute to or imitation of Terry, but is instead because his birthday is February 26. Huddersfield are set to compete in the Championship play-offs, and Colwill is hopeful of making the step up to the Premier League next season - whether in Yorkshire or at Stamford Bridge. He said: ‚ÄúEven though I know there are a lot of people talking about me, I don‚Äôt listen. I just say it‚Äôs all a load of rubbish because if I start playing badly for a few games, they will be saying I‚Äôm not good enough. ""It‚Äôs just a lot of talk and I don‚Äôt buy into it. I haven‚Äôt really thought about playing in Chelsea‚Äôs first team next season. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with what‚Äôs going on with the takeover. I have just been concentrating on Huddersfield. It‚Äôs the only thing I can affect right now. I won‚Äôt be thinking about what I do next until this season is done. ‚ÄúThings have been going well.

Liverpool match Man City Premier League record with Mane's strike against Aston Villa,"Liverpool made history as Sadio Mane snatched a winner against Aston Villa to keep their title hopes alive on Tuesday, with the Reds matching a Premier League record set by rivals Manchester City. Jurgen Klopp's side pulled level with the Citizens at the summit after fighting back to claim victory against former player Steven Gerrard's side at Villa Park. Joel Matip was fast to cancel out Douglas Luiz's early opener for the hosts, before Mane won it with a header after the break - and it was the Senegal star's effort that means he has entered the record books once again. With Mane finding the back of the net, it now means that three Liverpool players have hit the 15-goal mark across the 2021-22 campaign. The forward joins fellow Reds attackers Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota in hitting the magic number, offering a timely reminder of the thrilling firepower on hand for the Reds. Their efforts mean they are just the second team in Premier League history to have three players reach the figure in a single campaign too, after City‚Äôs title-winning side of 2013-14 managed the feat thanks to the trio of Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero, and Edin Dzeko. Having claimed victory in nervy circumstances at Villa Park, Klopp and company must wait for the result of City's own Premier League entanglement on Wednesday before they know their next steps. If Pep Guardiola leads his team to victory, the champions will move three points clear at the summit again, with just two games to play. If they draw, City will open up a one-point gap on Liverpool, while defeat will ensure the pair are neck-and-neck heading into their final pair of fixtures - though even then, the Citizens could retain an overall lead thanks to a superior goal difference.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-match-man-city-premier-league-record-with-mane-s/blte353ddee2575034b,Andrew Steel,e0920c95-3a84-4e12-a239-ff25beb1fc23
Kahn admits Kane transfer is a 'dream of the future' for Bayern Munich,"Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has clarified that the club are not interested in signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur in the ongoing transfer window, but hasn't ruled out a ""dream"" move for the forward in the future.

Kane is still under contract at Spurs until 2024, however, Kahn has hinted he could emerge on the German club's transfer radar at a later date. Speaking to Sport Bild in an exclusive interview, Kahn said of Bayern's reported interest in Kane: ‚ÄúHe's under contract with Tottenham. Sure, an absolute top striker, but that's all a dream of the future."" He added: ""Now we have to look at getting the squad together for the current season. Let's see what else happens."" Harry Kane signed a six-year contract in 2018 and still has two years left to run on that agreement.

"Gambia were beaten by great Cameroon, future Afcon champions ‚Äì Saintfiet","The Gambia coach Tom Saintfiet has labelled Cameroon as future champions after they eliminated them from the Africa Cup of Nations at the quarter-final stage on Saturday. The Indomitable Lions reached the last four on home soil after they secured a 2-0 win against the Scorpions at Japoma Stadium in Douala, Cameroon. After a goalless first half, Cameroon, who have won the Afcon five times, returned a more rejuvenated side and it was Karl Toko Ekambi, who grabbed a brace, scoring in the 50th and 57th minutes to silence the Gambia, who were making their first appearance at the competition. ‚ÄúI am proud of my players, in the tournament but also in this match where we lost (0-2) against a great team from Cameroon, we were beaten by the future champions of Africa,‚Äù Saintfiet told reporters as quoted by CafOnline. ‚ÄúWe made mistakes that we paid for in cash, that's also the high level.

Troost-Ekong: Nigeria‚Äôs Super Eagles will rise again after recent setbacks,"Nigeria defender William Troost-Ekong believes the Super Eagles will rise again after their recent setbacks in international assignments. The Super Eagles have endured a disappointing campaign in the last few months.  First, they suffered disappointment at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and later failed to clinch qualification for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar. In Cameroon, Augustine Eguavoen's side failed to go past the Round of 16 despite winning all their group matches after losing 1-0 against Tunisia. The Super Eagles then turned their focus to the World Cup qualification playoffs where they came up against Ghana. After claiming a 0-0 draw in the first leg meeting in Kumasi, they earned a 1-1 draw in the return fixture in Abuja, a result that saw the Black Stars qualify for the finals in Qatar on the away goals rule. The 28-year-old Troost-Ekong, who features for relegated Watford in England, believes the team will come back stronger from the disappointments. ‚ÄúIt has been a tough few months for all of us, it‚Äôs a big heartache we have to keep on moving,‚Äù Troost-Ekong told reporters as quoted by Completesports.  ‚ÄúWhen you fall down you have to stand up again, this team has been down before and came back and I believe we will do it again.‚Äù Nigeria are currently in Dallas, USA, in readiness for their friendly matches against Mexico and Ecuador and Troost-Ekong believes the two fixtures will give the Super Eagles a good chance to refresh ahead of the 2023 Afcon qualifiers. ‚ÄúWe all arrive from a long travel here in Dallas it was amazing to meet the coach and the new coaching crew,‚Äù Troost-Ekong continued. ‚ÄúTraining was good it is great to see there are lots of home-based players here as well who have the chance to show themselves.

Man City's De Bruyne beats Salah to win Premier League Player of the Season,"Kevin De Bruyne has beaten Liverpool star Mohamed Salah to be named the Premier League Player of the Season for the second time in his career after a superb 2021-22 campaign. The Manchester City playmaker saw off the Liverpool attacker - who won the corresponding prize from the Football Writers' Association earlier this month - to join a rare group of players to win the honour twice. The Belgium international was previously handed the gong in 2019-20 and admitted that it was an honour to claim it once more. ""To win this award for a second time is an achievement that I am really proud of,"" the midfielder told the club's official website. ""There is so much quality in the Premier League and it is a pleasure to be nominated with so many other great players who have had incredible seasons for their clubs.

In addition to Salah, the Belgian saw off competition from team-mate Joao Cancelo, Liverpool wing-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, West Ham's Jarrod Bowen, Arsenal's Bukayo Saka, Tottenham's Son Heung-min and Southampton's James Ward-Prowse to win the prize. Curiously, while De Bruyne becomes the first player since Manchester United's Nemanja Vidic to win the award for a second time, it also marks the second time he has failed to nab the corresponding FWA prize, having been beaten to it in 2019-20 by Liverpool's Jordan Henderson.

"Liverpool to sign Celtic teenager Ben Doak in ¬£600,000 deal","Liverpool are set to win the race to sign highly-rated Celtic youngster Ben Doak, GOAL can confirm. The 16-year-old winger, who has already featured twice for the Scottish giants‚Äô senior side, is ready to make the move to Merseyside, subject to a medical, having turned down offers from a host of other clubs. Doak, a Scotland U17 international who scored a hat-trick against Georgia earlier this week, will not be eligible to feature for the Reds until next season, and will initially join the club's academy set-up in any case, but was pictured on social media with a No 7 Liverpool shirt on Thursday. Born in Ayrshire, Doak has worked his way through the ranks at Celtic and was handed his professional debut by Ange Postecoglu as a substitute in the Hoops‚Äô win over Dundee United in January. He then made another cameo appearance against Old Firm rivals Rangers four days later, with sources suggesting Celtic were looking to convince him to sign a professional contract with the club on his 17th birthday in November. Liverpool had made their move by then, and Doak was understood to be immediately sold on the idea of a switch to Anfield despite interest from other clubs, including Chelsea and Leeds.¬† The Reds will, after what were described by sources as ""constructive and amicable"" talks, pay a six-figure compensation fee, understood to be around ¬£600,000 ($790,000) to Celtic, with Doak likely to go straight into the club‚Äôs U18 set-up to begin with. üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø pic.twitter.com/Fh0PiLJoOS Doak is likely to be joined at Kirkby next season by Trent Kone-Doherty, a 15-year-old who currently plays with Derry City.

Arsenal vs Wolves match postponed due to injury and Covid-19 outbreak among visitors,"The Premier League match between Arsenal and Wolves, scheduled to be played on Tuesday, has been postponed. The Premier League has granted Wolves‚Äô request to call the game off because of the injuries and Covid-19 cases that have ravaged their squad. They do not have enough players available to play the game. The announcement comes after Bruno Lage‚Äôs side saw their Boxing Day match postponed because of a Covid-19 outbreak in the Watford squad. ""Arsenal‚Äôs match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Emirates Stadium, due to be played at 12:30GMT on Tuesday 28 December, has regrettably been postponed,"" a statement from the Premier League read.¬† ""The Premier League Board accepted the postponement application as Wolves do not have the required number of players available for the match (13 outfield players and one goalkeeper) as a result of a number of Covid-19 cases and injuries at the club. ""The Board was able to make its decision in advance of the fixture to give clarity to the affected clubs and their fans.¬†We apologise for the inconvenience and disruption caused to supporters‚Äô festive plans."" Wolves‚Äô squad has been depleted by injuries in recent weeks, with the likes of Rayan Ait-Nouri, Hwang Hee-chan and Willy Boly all out. They have joined long-term absentees Pedro Neto, Jonny Castro Otto and Yerson Mosquera on the injury list. Two players, Fabio Silva and Mosquera, tested positive for Covid-19 last week but further cases have occurred among the squad. The clash between Arsenal and Wolves is the second game that was supposed to be played on December 28 that has been called off. Leeds and Aston Villa were supposed to go head-to-head at Elland Road that day, but the home side do not have enough first-team players to fulfil the fixture.

Abramovich disqualified by Premier League but Chelsea still able to play matches,"Roman Abramovich has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea by the Premier League. The decision comes in the wake of the UK government's decision to sanction the Russian oligarch and freeze his assets. A statement from the English top-flight confirmed the decision on Saturday, but the club will still be allowed to play matches despite the announcement. ""Following the imposition of sanctions by the UK Government, the Premier League Board has disqualified Roman Abramovich as a Director of Chelsea Football Club. ""The Board‚Äôs decision does not impact on the club‚Äôs ability to train and play its fixtures, as set out under the terms of a licence issued by the Government which expires on 31 May 2022."" GOAL's Chelsea correspondent Nizaar Kinsella says: ""The announcement from the Premier League doesn't change a lot except to say that Abramovich isn't welcome in English football.  ""It comes after the UK government's statement that Abramovich was being sanctioned amid a 'pro-Kremlin' stance and that he had 'a close relationship with warlord Vladimir Putin for decades'. He was also accused of 'destabilising Ukraine'.  ""Abramovich has now been essentially removed from his role as a director, which had been in place since his 2003 takeover of the Blues. Such a move would have normally forced the Russian into a sale, although it is immaterial in that sense as the process of selling Chelsea is already underway.  ""As for how this affects Chelsea on the pitch, it will be 'business as usual', as Thomas Tuchel put it after the win over Norwich, with the west Londoners still able to fulfil their match duties in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League."" Abramovich announced on February 26 that he was passing on the stewardship of Chelsea to trustees in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old put the club up for sale and it was reported that he was looking for bids of around ¬£3 billion ($3.9bn). His assets were frozen on March 10, however, as the UK Government took action against figures associated with Russian president Vladimir Putin.  Despite the moves to block Abramovich's involvement in English football going forward, Chelsea are still able to complete a sale of the club, with New York investment bank Raine Group running the process and the deadline for bids having been extended to March 18. Swiss-American pair Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly, Turkish billionaire Muhsin Bayrak and British duo Jamie Reuben and Nick Candy are among the candidates to express an interest in taking ownership of the club since Abramovich confirmed he wants to sell.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/abramovich-disqualified-by-premier-league-but-chelsea-still-able-/blt90f8a7928687e053,By Peter McVitie,0098c006-d86b-40ec-84c6-e3aebb2796c1
"Wilshere will 100% return to Arsenal, says Arteta after midfielder joined AGF Aarhus","Mikel Arteta has said that Jack Wilshere will ‚Äú100 per cent‚Äù return to Arsenal in a coaching capacity. The midfielder spent 10 years in the Gunners' first team after coming through their youth ranks, with injuries playing their part in an exit from the Emirates in 2018. After subsequently spending time with Bournemouth and West Ham, the 30-year-old is now lacing up his boots for AGF Aarhus in Denmark. Asked if Wilshere would return to north London some day as a coach, Arteta told a press conference: ‚ÄúOne hundred per cent. I think everyone at the club would be willing to open the doors for him and try to find a role for him that would work for everybody.  ‚ÄúI think that will happen naturally in the future.‚Äù Having spent time as a free agent since the end of last season, Wilshere had the opportunity to train with Arsenal while he decided whether to hang up his boots in favour of pursuing a coaching career or continue the search for a new club. Now on the books at AGF, Arteta offered the former England international some words of encouragement. He said: ‚ÄúWell, first of all, thank you for what he‚Äôs done all the time with us. It‚Äôs been great to have him, and I think I‚Äôm speaking on behalf of everybody and the club, it‚Äôs been absolutely a pleasure to have Jack back.  ‚ÄúTo enjoy watching him play next to us, to have him around, the inspiration that he is for all the young people. Hopefully we can help him - we have helped him a little bit as well - because he had some doubts with what to do, whether to start coaching or continue playing.  ‚ÄúI think this group of players have given him again that necessity to experience - on a daily basis - how magnificent it is to feel like a football player, and I think he wants to experience that again.  ‚ÄúWe wish him the best of luck.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/wilshere-100-per-cent-return-arsenal-arteta-midfielder-agf/blt67e1668c7b0818be,Stephen Crawford,ee6c8ce5-bb70-4432-922d-edfe9b7ac796
"Leicester vs Roma: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Leicester hope to bring an end to a three-game winless run when they host Roma in the semi-final of the Europa Conference League on Thursday. Brendan Rodgers goes up against his former mentor Jose Mourinho in the first leg of the last-four tie and both teams will be determined to gain the upper hand at King Power Stadium.  Leicester are favourites to win the clash and are 5/4 (2.25) to claim a first-leg victory with bet365. Roma, meanwhile, lost 3-1 to Inter at the weekend and are 11/5 (3.20) with the draw offered at 12/5 (3.40). Jamie Vardy is the lowest-priced striker to net the game's first goal at 9/2 (5.50). Next in the betting is Roma star Tammy Abraham, who is priced at 5/1 (6.00). Leicester have dropped to 10th in the Premier League, so winning the Europa Conference League is their only route to qualifying for next season's Europa League. They are on a three-game winless run, having lost to Newcastle and drawn against Everton and Aston Villa in recent weeks. The Foxes are boosted by the return of Jamie Vardy, however, as the striker came off the bench against Aston Villa to make his first appearance since early-March. Roma, meanwhile, were held to a 1-1 draw by Napoli and beaten by Inter, but they remain fifth in Serie A and on course for a place in the Europa League, though Lazio and Fiorentina are breathing down their necks. Both teams have scored in seven of Leicester's last 10 home games, as has been the case in Roma's last three. That bet is 4/5 (1.8) Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+. begambleaware.org",https://www.goal.com/en/news/leicester-vs-roma-predictions-odds-and-betting-tips/bltbda91d498c84bde0,Peter McVitie,8107cdb7-91bd-4678-ac50-1a47985d450d
Messi says PSG on right track to win Champions League as former Barcelona star aims to win trophy for first time since 2015,"Lionel Messi is confident that Paris Saint-Germain can win the Champions League. The French side's main ambition is to win Europe's premier club competition, while it has been almost seven years since the Argentine last lifted the trophy with Barcelona. PSG are close to reaching the quarter-finals this year, having beaten Real Madrid 1-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie on Tuesday. Messi believes they can go all the way in the competition in the near future, but warned that it is not an easy thing to achieve. He told the club's magazine: ""It's complicated to win the Champions League.¬†Complicated, because it's a competition that brings together the best teams, and where the smallest detail and the slightest mistake can eliminate you.  ""I believe we have a team that can try to win it"". ‚ÄúWe are excited about this idea and we really hope to get there, but we have to take things slowly.¬† ""I repeat, it is difficult to win the Champions League.¬†It's not always the best team that wins it and you really have to focus on all the details, thinking about being the strongest team possible.¬† ""In the end, it is the strongest teams that achieve their goals.¬†And we are on this path, seeking to become even stronger than what we are."" The Ligue 1 leaders are aiming to go one better than their all-time best finish in the Champions League in 2019-20, when they finished second. PSG lost in the final that year to Bayern Munich but can eliminate the competition's most successful team if they hold on to their advantage in the second-leg. Mauricio Pochettino's team host the Spanish giants on March 9, when they can book their place in the last-eight.

Haaland: Dortmund are pressuring me to make decision on future,"Erling Haaland has said Borussia Dortmund are strongly pressuring him to make a decision on his playing future. Haaland has been linked with a big-money move to a host of Europe's top clubs after proving himself as one of the world's top strikers at age 21.  Speaking after he scored twice in Dortmund's 5-1 win against Freiburg on Friday, Haaland admitted he was unable to fully focus on football amid the pressure campaign from his club. ""The last six months, I have chosen not to say anything out of respect for Dortmund,"" Haaland told Viaplay. ""But now the club has started to pressure me into making a decision, but all I want to do is to play football.  ""But they press me to make a decision now about my future. So that means I have to make a decision soon. ""I have said from the beginning that I want to focus on football, because that is when I am at my best, not when other things come into my mind.  ""Now they have put pressure for a while. So it is time to get things started. All I want to do is to play football, but I can't do that now."" Haaland signed a deal until 2024 at Dortmund when he transferred from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020, but he could be set to depart long before that contract expires. A host of major European clubs, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain, have been linked with a move. The Norway international will see a reported ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£63m/$85m) release clause activate this summer.

Neymar 'tried everything' to return to Barcelona before Messi's PSG transfer,"Neymar has revealed that he ""tried everything"" to return to Barcelona before Lionel Messi's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. PSG paid a world-record ‚Ç¨222 million (¬£185m/$252m) fee to sign Neymar from Barca in 2017, bringing to an end his hugely successful four-year stint at Camp Nou. The Brazil international won two La Liga titles and the Champions League among a whole host of other honours with the Blaugrana while forming one-third of a deadly attacking trio alongside Messi and Luis Suarez, but failed to transfer his electrifying form to Parc des Princes. Neymar recorded plenty of goals and assists in his first two seasons at PSG, but also struggled with niggling injuries and ill-discipline, with supporters seemingly turning against him following an incident after the French Cup final in 2019 that saw him punch a spectator. The forward was strongly linked with a move back to Barca in the summer transfer window of the same year, but a deal never materialised and he has since worked his way back into favour with the PSG faithful. ‚ÄúI tried to return to Barca. We tried everything, but it wasn't possible,"" Neymar confirmed when quizzed on the saga on the Fenomenos podcast. The 30-year-old is now quite content at Parc des Princes and no longer has any desire to re-sign for the Blaugrana, especially after being reunited with Messi. Neymar added on the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner, who left Camp Nou before joining PSG on a free transfer in August: ‚ÄúI am very happy Leo had the opportunity to come here. ""He is my friend and we get on very well."" Familiar fitness issues have plagued Neymar in 2021-22 as he has only managed to appear in 16 games in all competitions, recording four goals and four assists. The former Barca talisman suffered ankle ligament damage in November and missed over two months of action before returning from the bench in a last-16 Champions League meeting with Real Madrid. Neymar then started PSG's next game in Ligue 1 against Nantes, but missed a penalty in embarrassing fashion as Mauricio Pochettino's side succumbed to a surprise 3-1 defeat. Messi, meanwhile, had his own injury problems at the start of the season and was consequently unable to hit the ground running in Paris. The 34-year-old has had to gradually rediscover his matchday sharpness and golden touch in the final third, and is still not back to his best just yet, finding the net just seven times in 22 outings while laying on another nine goals for his team-mates.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-tried-everything-to-return-to-barcelona-before-messi/blte8130eed2f0412cf,James Westwood,491a0499-a070-42d0-8cc0-1fbbf1387cb5

Diallo: Why is on-loan Manchester United star struggling at Rangers?,"Ex-Scotland international Steven Thompson believes Ivory Coast youngster Amad Diallo is full of potential but that it might take time for him to be a starter at Rangers. The 19-year-old came off the bench to score and help the Gers defeat Dundee United and Ross County in the league assignments, but has largely struggled to make an impact.  The Manchester United star, who joined the Scottish heavyweights on loan, has featured nine times for the team in the league and scored three goals. ""In the second half against Dundee United he was brilliant,"" Thompson said as quoted by BBC Sport Africa, ""but that's at Ibrox when you're very comfortable in a game and you're getting a lot of freedom on the ball.  ""That wasn't the case in the Old Firm game [at Celtic in February] where he wasn't performing so well."" The Red Devils paid Atalanta an initial fee of ¬£19m for the teenager's services with a further ¬£18.2m in add-ons. However, at Old Trafford, the Elephant managed just one Premier League start before being sent on loan. Thompson says the price tag might have put pressure on the youngster who he believes must up his game to stand a chance of being a regular with the Gers. ""I think pressure comes with the price tag that was paid for him. That brings a level of expectancy from supporters that watch him,"" the 43-year-old former striker continued. ""He's obviously full of potential and in flashes, he looks very, very good, but I think he's a bit off becoming a regular starter for Rangers."" Diallo played in the Old Firm Derby against Celtic on May 1 but struggled to impress as the teams settled to a 1-1 draw. Thompson insists it was a setback for him but went on to state the player is still learning. ""At Celtic, he almost looked like a rabbit in the headlights. That set him back, I think, both from a kind of mental point of view and the fact that then Giovanni van Bronckhorst didn't use him as much. ""When you look at Amad and the amount of games he's played as a professional footballer, he's hardly played any. He's learning. ""What happens to him next season? I guess we'll find out.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/diallo-why-is-on-loan-manchester-united-star-struggling-at/blt53eb3520ca64d9dd,Seth Willis,7dee949b-1de2-4c63-b9c9-da1c24f4d5ec
Neville backs plan to demolish Old Trafford & urges Man Utd to build 'brand new super stadium',"Former Manchester United star Gary Neville says he is in favour of the club's plans to redevelop Old Trafford. GOAL reported this week that United are considering ideas to upgrade the stadium and are even open to demolishing and completely rebuilding it on the same site. The club hope to modernise their home ground, but plans are still in the early stages and nothing is being ruled out. Neville gave his backing to the proposal to completely rebuild Old Trafford as he believes the club should always have one of the best football grounds in the world. ""There is a story emerging today from Old Trafford that they might be looking rebuild the entire stadium and I have just been asked what I think of it,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram. ""I actually think that it would be the right move. I think that by the time that they have spent money on Old Trafford, the existing one, then I think you would probably be better off building a brand new, super stadium. ""I do think that Manchester United should always be at the forefront of stadiums, best facilities and they have fallen behind."" Asked by Jamie Carragher if he would get behind the Glazers if they were to build a new stadium, Neville said: ""No, not particularly. I do think it's time for them to sell. I do think that they've, to be fair, overstayed their welcome.  ""I think the fact that they said they would engage with the fans three, four, five months ago and they haven't done since is not good enough. I think it would be a breath of fresh air. ""But I do think the stadium needs redevelopment. It's fallen behind many other stadiums, not just in this country, but obviously in Europe and I do think they need to rebuild that stadium."" Old Trafford has served as United's home stadium for 112 years. It has already gone through several expansions since then and is currently the United Kingdom's largest club football stadium - only England's home stadium Wembley has a bigger capacity.  GOAL reported on Monday that the option of tearing down the entire stadium and building a new one from scratch looks the least likely option. The club would rather upgrade Old Trafford in a way which would allow the team to continue playing their home games at the same place.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neville-backs-demolish-old-trafford-man-utd-build-brand-new/blt342a72b559dea0f7,By Peter McVitie,3669da05-8237-432a-9c0c-e90835738089
'Who is this?' - Ancelotti plays coy on Rudiger links as Chelsea defender nears Real Madrid deal,"Carlo Ancelotti dodged questions about the potential signing of Chelsea star Antonio Rudiger as the Real Madrid boss briefly pretended not to know who the defender is. Rudiger has reached a verbal agreement to join Madrid this summer, with his Chelsea career set to come to an end once his contract expires at the end of the season. But, when quizzed about the potential signing, Ancelotti played coy before saying he didn't feel comfortable talking about a player that is not at the club currently. ""Toni Rudiger? Toni who? Who‚Äôs this?"" Ancelotti said with a laugh when asked by beIN Sports.  ""He's still a Chelsea player. I can‚Äôt say anything about this."" The defender's contract is set to expire this season and, with the club still in a bit of limbo due to the ownership situation, Chelsea will be unable to re-sign him. Rudiger certainly has his share of suitors, with Manchester United, Barcelona and Juventus interested, while PSG and Bayern Munich also previously made offers. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel all but acknowledged his departure, but says Rudiger will remain a key piece for the club right up until the day he leaves. ""He has no doubts and has made no doubts about it, he will play until the end of the season with everything he has,"" Tuchel said after his side's 1-0 win over West Ham. ""This is what he did from day one, and it's what he will do until the last minute.

Trippier: I didn't transfer to Newcastle for the money,"Kieran Trippier has insisted his transfer to Newcastle from Atletico Madrid was not money-motivated. Trippier became Newcastle's first major signing under their new Saudi owners on January 7, with Atletico sanctioning his departure in a ¬£12 million deal. More than a few eyebrows were raised as the 31-year-old swapped life with the Liga champions for a relegation battle at St James' Park, with it suggested that he put financial gain ahead of career progression. The former Tottenham right-back, who initially joined Atletico in 2019, says he has managed to block out those critics because he knows the true reason for his return to the Premier League in his heart. ""It didn't annoy me. For me, it doesn't bother me,"" Trippier said on the True Geordie podcast. ""I know my reasons why I came back and money wasn't one of them.  ""If it was, I would have stayed in Madrid. I didn't really think of that. I was just excited about the whole thing, coming back to England and playing in the Premier League. ""I know my reasons why I came back, to live in the north and for my family, and of course for the project as well. I spoke to the managers, the owners about the direction they want the club to go in. ""It's exciting, and for me it was a no-brainer to come back to England."" Trippier added on his first impressions of Mehrdad Ghodoussi¬†and the rest of Newcastle's new owners: ""Very good people. We were talking about the direction they want the club to go in, we all need to realise it's a building process. The most important thing for us is staying in the league this season."" Trippier signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Magpies and made his debut in their surprise 1-0 FA Cup third-round defeat to Cambridge on January 8. The England international has since appeared in three further games for Newcastle, scoring in Premier League wins over Everton and Aston Villa, but he also suffered a broken foot in the second of those outings. Trippier may be forced to miss the remainder of the 2021-22 campaign, but the Magpies are now in a strong position to avoid the drop despite his absence, with a 2-1 win against Brighton last time out taking them seven points clear of the relegation zone.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/trippier-transfer-newcastle-money/bltfc39e066e82bd442,James Westwood,4573afcf-8a43-48b7-b8b2-6b33455960c6
USMNT's Pulisic has 'no regrets' as he hopes to qualify for first World Cup,"Christian Pulisic reflected on the five years since the U.S. men's national team missed the 2018 World Cup as he said he has ""no regrets"" on how his career has turned out. A young Pulisic was expected to be one of the game's breakout stars in Russia, but that opportunity was snatched away when the U.S. fell to Trinidad & Tobago to miss out on qualifying altogether. In the years since, Pulisic has emerged as perhaps American soccer's most talented-ever player and has gone on to star with both the national team and Chelsea, and Pulisic said he's confident this current group has what it takes to learn from what happened in past years. Over the next week, Pulisic and the USMNT will get the chance to qualify for the World Cup since the first time since 2014, having famously missed out last cycle. Pulisic was on the field in Couva that night the U.S. had their fates sealed, with the winger robbed of his chance to star in Russia at the World Cup. Much has changed in the years since, including most of the national team, and Pulisic reflected on the ups and downs over the last few years ahead of this clash against Mexico. ""I have no regrets,"" he said. ""Obviously, we were in a position to do it last time and we weren't able to reach our goal, but this is a bunch of guys who are really just looking forward and a really hungry team who is going to give absolutely everything to make sure that we have a spot in the World Cup.  ""I think it's something we obviously don't want to go through again, but there's really no regrets from that time. I've obviously learned a lot and this team has learned a lot in our careers and I think it's just a mindset now as well, where we are a confident bunch of guys and we can go into any game thinking that we can win."" As the most talked-about player of the USMNT's current generation, Pulisic is often under the microscope and often deals with increased scrutiny for club and country. He's spoken about his own journey with mental health and how he looks to cope with outside pressures, admitting that it is a process to learn how to navigate the ups and downs of his career. On Wednesday, Pulisic admitted that there are moments where he has perhaps put too much pressure on himself to be the star and how he now feels more comfortable playing his part as a member of the team. ""I didn't think that going into the game, but I just thought, looking back on it, I felt that I was trying to do too much at times or trying to do unnecessary things that I don't necessarily need to do for this team.  ""I'm in a good position now. I'm in good rhythm I feel that I'm in good form and I'm excited to be here and I'm just going to give everything and do whatever we can to help, the same way I always want to do.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-pulisic-has-no-regrets-as-he-hopes-to-qualify-for/blta279963b54d37e57,Ryan Tolmich,5581ad5c-760c-441d-ae39-09421071725d
Evra: Players said having gay team-mate would be 'against their religion',"Patrice Evra has claimed some of his team-mates in England did not want gay players at their club for religious reasons. Evra, who played at Manchester United and West Ham along with several other clubs outside England, also stated his belief that there are at least two gay players on every team. Currently, Adelaide United midfielder Josh Cavallo¬†is the only openly¬†gay¬†male top-level professional football player in the world. ""When I was in England, they brought someone to talk to the team about homosexuality,""¬†Evra¬†told Le Parisien. ""Some of my colleagues said, 'It is against my religion, if there is a homosexual in this locker room, let him leave the club' and other comments. ""At that time, I said, 'Shut up'. I played with players who were gay. Face to face, they opened up with me because they are afraid to speak otherwise.

Premier League penalty takers: Every team's spot-kick specialist listed,"Premier League Fantasy Football enthusiasts will be eager to fill their team with the best penalty takers in order to earn maximum points in the event of a spot-kick being awarded. So, which players¬†should you be drafting into your ranks? GOAL takes a look at those charged with responsibility of stepping up from 12 yards, with a few back-up options also thrown into the mix... When you're choosing your forwards for your Fantasy Team, you might be tempted to sign a striker who's a noted penalty taker and has a good¬†conversion rate from the spot. Of course, the penalty takers for each team are never set in stone. Some clubs might have a consistent, dedicated penalty taker at all times, but sometimes, things change - and some last-minute decisions on who is to assume spot-kick duties might arrive. Additionally, there is the chance that the dedicated spot-kick taker has been subbed off or is simply not on the pitch at the time of the penalty being awarded. Still, we've rounded up a list of each club's primary, as well as¬†secondary, penalty takers in the table below,¬†and the players who have the best chance of being picked to convert a spot-kick. The primary penalty takers have been listed, and we've provided their deputy penalty takers should the first choice¬†be unavailable to step up.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-are-the-penalty-takers-for-each-of-the-premier-league/nflt1qvbq77j15o5iff78tn7k,GOAL,c9ff6b4c-1166-45ef-b3bd-e1f298f7de9a
Ronaldo at 37: Is time finally catching up with Man Utd superstar?,"If Cristiano Ronaldo fails to score against Burnley at Turf Moor on Tuesday night, it will be his longest goal drought at club level for over a decade.¬† Not since he played for Real Madrid in 2010 has the Portugal international gone five games without scoring and his current barren spell has led to debates about whether he should be dropped.¬† The forward celebrated his 37th birthday over the weekend and it is fair to argue that, despite his many talents, his best days are behind him.  That is not to say he should be written off and marched to the retirement home, but a place on the Manchester United bench might not go amiss.¬† His arrival back at Old Trafford in the summer sparked multiple conversations over whether he‚Äôs a help or hindrance; in reality, he has been both since his return from Juventus. He single handedly guaranteed United's progression to the knockout stages of the Champions League but the free-flowing nature of United‚Äôs attack has fallen away since he's been brought into the side.¬† He demands more from his team-mates but he should also be asking more of himself.  Of his 10 shots at Old Trafford on Friday night, in the FA Cup elimination to Middlesbrough, just three were on target and each missed opportunity was met with the kind of frustration that has become so common in Ronaldo‚Äôs performances: arms in the air, shouting at himself in annoyance.¬† One of those missed chances was a failed attempt from the penalty spot, an opportunity which could have helped United ease into the fifth round. While his Champions League form played a pivotal role in setting up a last-16 clash with Atletico Madrid, he has been unable to find the same level of consistency in the Premier League. He‚Äôs got eight goals in 18 appearances and is averaging a goal every 196 minutes. That is his lowest average over the last decade and his shots-per-game totals in the league are also at their lowest too.¬† During his peak at Real Madrid, he was finding the back of the net every 61 minutes in La Liga and averaging over six shots a game ‚Äì that figure is now less than four. He is not the same player he was in 2014-15; he is older, the Premier League is a challenging environment and there has also been an undeniable dip in form.¬† He will always be able to pull something special out of nowhere but his consistency levels, in the league especially, are not what they used to be. Even when he was deemed to be struggling at Juventus, he had a better return in the league than what he is currently managing at United.¬† As a team, United have been struggling going forward.  Manager Ralf Rangnick was happy with the number of chances they created against Middlesbrough but their inability to put them away is the reason why they have found themselves out of the FA Cup.  They can‚Äôt afford a similar display at Turf Moor on Tuesday night as United go in search of three precious points in their pursuit of a top-four finish.¬† Sources accept that Ronaldo‚Äôs return to Old Trafford last August was as much about his off-the-pitch influence as it was his ability on it. As he walked off the pitch on Friday night, he had his arm around Anthony Elanga, reassuring the Swede, who had missed the final kick in the penalty shootout which sent Rangnick‚Äôs side out. It is that kind of leadership and experience the club wanted to bring to the dressing room.¬† However, on the field, something has not been clicking in the way it was before. Too many times it has looked like United's system has been set up solely to accommodate Ronaldo, with his team-mates constantly trying to seek him out in the box. At this moment in time, it just isn‚Äôt working out for the Portugal captain and, with Edinson Cavani back and Elanga available, Rangnick has other options now.¬† So, will the German manager ask his star man to take a supporting role to give others a run? Or will he plough on, knowing that this is a man who has scored over 800 career goals and is sure to get over his drought sooner rather than later?¬† Ronaldo still has a big part to play but, at 37, the superstar might have to accept that his role may have to be slightly different to what it‚Äôs been during the previous 19 years.¬†",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-37-time-finally-catching-up-man-utd-superstar/bltadab34347c5bb2e7,Charlotte Duncker,f33af2ce-fc9a-41f5-acf4-21cd07ef84ff
Aston Villa vs Burnley off as latest Premier League fixture postponed amid Covid-19 surge,"Aston Villa and Burnley's Premier League clash this weekend has been called off hours before kick-off after the hosts recorded a number of positive Covid-19 test results within their squad. The clash between Steven Gerrard's hosts and Sean Dyche's Clarets at Villa Park becomes the latest top-flight game in England to be affected by the current Omicron surge across the country. It leaves Leeds United's encounter with Arsenal as the only remaining fixture of a ravaged Saturday schedule. Having already seen several fixtures postponed across December as infection rates have steadily risen throughout the country, the Premier League intended to soldier on today despite having been forced to postpone four matches. But with less than three hours to go until kick-off in Birmingham, Villa confirmed on social media that they would be postponing their game following an increased number of apparent cases throughout their playing group. It means they join a slew of matches scheduled for today that have already been forced off by Covid-19, including Manchester United's encounter with Brighton, Brentford's trip to Southampton, Watford's clash with Crystal Palace and West Ham's game with Norwich. Aston Villa can confirm that today‚Äôs Premier League fixture with Burnley has been postponed due to an increased amount of positive Covid-19 test results within our playing squad. Right now, the Premier League says that their remaining fixtures scheduled for this weekend are intended to go ahead as planned. This includes Leeds United and Arsenal's game on Saturday, along with Manchester City's trip to Newcastle, Chelsea's visit to Wolves and Liverpool's journey to Tottenham on Sunday. However, given the fluid nature of the situation, it may well prove that further games could be axed if additional case numbers are found to have risen within playing groups.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aston-villa-vs-burnley-off-as-latest-premier-league-fixture/blt2797ba180e36d95c,Andrew Steel,d3a1b115-e3a1-4a36-8d22-53859372ac91

Luka Modric was suffering from fever but has tested negative for Coronavirus, and, having re-joined training, he should also be fit to play. Ancelotti has already stated that he will field the same XI against Juve that will line up against Frankfurt in the UEFA Super Cup, which means that we can expect to see a full-strength starting line-up. Indeed, there is also the possibility that he picks the same team that won the Champions League in May. ""The 11 is going to be more like last year's because it's (the UEFA Super Cup) a tournament for winning the Champions League and that has to be taken into account.

"USWNT 2022 fixtures & results: SheBelieves Cup, Concacaf Championship & schedule in full","The U.S. women's national team put a difficult 2021 behind it in preparation for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next summer, where it will look to defend its title. In the first major tournament under Vlatko Andonovski, the U.S. underwhelmed, losing to Canada for the first time in 20 years in the semi-finals of the women's soccer tournament at the Olympic Games. Ultimately, the players did leave Japan with medals around their necks, beating Australia in the bronze medal match, but improvements were expected in 2022. The first fixtures for the USWNT in 2022 came in the SheBelieves Cup in February. Iceland, New Zealand and the Czech Republic were the three opponents for the U.S. this year, ranked 16th, 22nd and 24th in the world respectively. The tournament was not as straight-forward for the USWNT as some might have imagine, starting with a goalless draw against the Czech Republic, but Andonovski's side would go on to lift the trophy. The USWNT then played two friendlies with Uzbekistan in April, a nation ranked 45th in the world that failed to reach the final round of Women's World Cup qualifying in Asia, and a pair against Colombia in June in preparation for the CONCACAF Women's Championship in Mexico. The team went on to win that trophy, taking down Canada in the finale while not conceding a goal in the whole tournament. It also secured its place at the World Cup with its performances in the competition, as well as at the 2024 Olympic Games. Andonovski's side then closed out 2022 with a number of friendlies. It played Nigeria twice in September to kick off that run, beating the African nation on both occasions. The world champions came unstuck against England at Wembley, however, losing 2-1 to Sarina Wiegman's side and then lost to a heavily-depleted Spain team just a few days later. Defeat to Germany in November meant the USWNT had lost three games in a row for the first time since 1993, but a win over the same opponent just a few days later at least allowed this team to close out an up and down year on a high. Andonovski's side will be in action for the first time in 2023 in January, when it plays a double header against New Zealand and has an opportunity to scout out the venues it will play its Women's World Cup group stage fixtures at. Plenty more action will follow for the team throughout the year, including that huge tournament in Australia and New Zealand, with the eighth edition of the SheBelieves Cup also to come.

Liverpool or Man Utd? Which UK club has won the most major trophies?,"Legendary Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson famously stated that his mission was to knock his club's great rivals Liverpool off their perch and he managed to do just that. The Scottish manager won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups and three Champions League honours during his time with the Red Devils, and is regarded as one of the greatest of all-time. Following Liverpool's success in their sixth Champions League title in June 2019 and their 19th league title in 2020, however, Jurgen Klopp's side have shown that they are able to challenge once again. But which team can claim to be the most successful side on English soil, and how many trophies has each side won? GOAL takes a look. Well, it depends on who you ask. After Liverpool won their sixth UEFA Super Cup title in 2019, beating Chelsea through a penalty shootout in Istanbul, Reds fans were quick to claim that they became the most successful club in English football. In beating the Blues on that occasion, Liverpool lifted their 46th major trophy, with supporters believing¬†that they had surpassed great rivals Manchester United, who, they said, have 45 major trophies. While the Reds have now won 50¬†major prizes ‚Äì including the league,¬†FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League/European Cup, the UEFA Cup/Europa League and¬†the UEFA Super Cup ‚Äì¬†their count disregards one competition. Liverpool's 50¬†major titles exclude the number of Community Shield titles they have won, which is the key point of the discussion ‚Äì as Man Utd have a record 21 Community Shields to their name,¬†compared to Liverpool's 16. And so, if Community Shield titles are to count in the trophy haul, Man Utd have one trophy more than Liverpool who have won 66 major titles. With the Carabao Cup triumph over Newcastle United the Red Devils are now once again the most successful team in England. *Accurate as of March 5, 2022. The key point of contention between the sets of supporters is about whether or not the Community Shield counts as a major title. Once again, it depends on who you ask. The FA considers the Community Shield to be an official honour in English football, and it is seen as the first game of the new English top-flight season, though its status as a 'major title' has been contested by certain football figures and fans. The Community Shield is seen as a minor trophy to some compared to the likes of the FA Cup and League Cup, with some referring to it as a 'glorified friendly' ‚Äì especially as yellow card and red cards earned in the match¬†do not carry on to other competitions. In 2008, Alex Ferguson stated:¬†""The Community Shield is a prestigious match, but I have used players in it who were not quite fit..."" However, for the most part, players and managers involved in the Community Shield respect its status as a major trophy, and regard it as the first 'final' of the season. Speaking on his players' fitness levels ahead of the 2018 Community Shield against Chelsea, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said: ""We have just four or five days to prepare for the first final [Community Shield].¬†so we have to adapt.¬† ""Some of them are coming back before,¬†some are coming back after the final."" Moreover, in 2016, ex-Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri added:¬†""Why do you say this question, a friendly? [Since] when¬†is the Community Shield a friendly? ""Of course we will be at the maximum and Manchester United will be at their maximum. The two teams want to win. I am very excited.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-man-utd-which-uk-club-have-won-most-major-trophies/eq9664p329p619x4ae81f2xff,GOAL,cb213201-e954-43e8-ba2d-1ecd1e9415dc

'Chelsea get sanctioned everywhere they go' - Blues face identity crisis in post-Abramovich era,"""Chelsea get sanctioned everywhere they go,"" chanted the Chelsea supporters who travelled to Norwich on Thursday night. It was tongue-in-cheek, sung in defiance, and intended to hit back at the UK establishment which froze owner Roman Abramovich's assets, including Chelsea Football Club, shortly before kick-off. The Blues showed the quality that has become commonplace at the club since the Russian's controversial takeover in 2003 by winning 3-1 at Carrow Road.¬† Those chants of support for Abramovich felt wrong, with war presently being waged on European soil for the first time since the 1990s. On the morning of the game, Abramovich was described by the government as ""pro-Kremlin"", having had ""a close relationship with warlord Vladimir Putin for decades"" and accused of ""destabilising Ukraine"".¬† The sanctions which followed were explained to the world in geopolitical and economic terms but were hard to swallow for many Chelsea fans. Their response was to either ignore or dispute the British government‚Äôs view.¬† Football tribalism came into play, with fans attacking critics of Abramovich on social media and sponsors like Three, which has suspended a ¬£40 million-a-year ($52.5m) deal. Abramovich‚Äôs 19-year reign as Chelsea‚Äôs owner brought joy to the club‚Äôs supporters ‚Äì including two Champions League titles ‚Äì and there is a drive among them to protect that legacy.¬† It's hard to imagine the next owner being as successful as the Russian, even though at least 20 serious bidders emerged ahead of the sanctions.¬† Oh, there's a match pic.twitter.com/yTyhH7E5lO Chelsea's success under Abramovich has been dazzling but has blinded some Blues supporters. They don't see anything other than winning the club game's biggest trophies.¬† But there was a Chelsea before Abramovich and there will be a Chelsea after.

Guardiola jokingly apologises to reporter over his support for Manchester United,"Pep Guardiola jokingly apologised to a reporter over his support for Manchester United after watching his Manchester City side beat Newcastle on Sunday. City edged closer to retaining their Premier League crown with a 5-0 home victory over the Magpies that gives them a three-point lead over second-placed Liverpool with only three games remaining. Guardiola was not completely happy after the final whistle, though, as he claimed that everyone in England supports Liverpool, which lead to an awkward exchange with a journalist. The City boss suggested that the reporter in question is among the high number of Liverpool supporters in the country, but was swiftly corrected. Asked if he was ""ecstatic"" with his side's latest performance, Guardiola replied with a wry smile: ""Did you have doubts? Yes, you are a Liverpool fan. Come on."" The Spaniard was then informed that the journalist was in fact a Manchester United fan, rather than a Liverpool follower, which prompted an outburst of laughter in the room. Guardiola then said: ""I'm sorry, James."" City bounced back from the disappointing Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid in style against Newcastle, and only need seven points from their last three games to clinch the Premier League trophy. Guardiola will take his side to Molineux to face Wolves on Wednesday, four days before another difficult trip to West Ham. If City win both of those games then they can secure the title with a draw at home to Aston Villa on the final day of the season.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-jokingly-apologises-reporter-support-manchester/blt4128bc7f4a0b7fd9,James Westwood,ad6699d9-3428-47fd-958a-5841e4f4c075
Which football team does Tom Brady support?,"Tom Brady enjoyed a busy weekend as the guest of honour for Manchester United's Premier League win over Tottenham on Saturday before reversing his decision to retire from NFL on Sunday. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback announced that he would play on 40 days after announcing he would hang up his boots, shortly after watching Cristiano Ronaldo deliver a superb performance for the Red Devils. But from one superstar to another, just who does Brady support? GOAL brings you everything you need to know about his soccer allegiance. Brady has shown his allegience for several sides and players over the years, but most recently appeared to back Manchester United. Watching the Premier League side in action from the surroundings of the Director's Box at Old Trafford this weekend, the star was visibly delighted to see Ronaldo bag his second-ever hat-trick for Man Utd in a pulsating five-goal encounter. The veteran quarterback then held conversations with several members of the Red Devils squad post-match, posing for photos before a one-on-one chat with his fellow GOAT. üêê x üêê @Cristiano ü§ù @TomBrady #MUFC pic.twitter.com/GFTkJ8B84W However, Brady has also spoken of his admiration for Tottenham and England forward Harry Kane, and addressed his hopes that the striker would get on the scoresheet on Saturday, even while he rooted against his side. Here we go! @Cristiano vs. @HKane. I might fist pump if you score Harry but I‚Äôm riding with @ManUtd today. pic.twitter.com/ybgHozzSBm But in spite of his long dominance at the top of the NFL, Brady clearly loves an underdog story too, as he did in 2016 when he threw his support behind Leicester City.

Watch: Suarez gets rousing welcome on his return to boyhood club Nacional,"Luis Suarez was given a heart-warming welcome by Nacional fans from the moment he landed at Montevideo airport from Barcelona on Sunday. Thousands of tricolour fans were waiting for him and they escorted him to Parque Central Stadium where he was officially presented as a Nacional player.  The forward departed Atletico Madrid after finishing his contract at the end of last season and then signed a pre-agreement with the Uruguayan outfit. He started his senior career at Nacional in 2005 and quickly earned a transfer across the globe to Groningen in Netherlands after his impressive performances with the Bolsilludo.

Manchester United manager Ten Hag gives clearest indication about Ronaldo's future,"Erik ten Hag has given the clearest indication Cristiano Ronaldo now wants to stay at Manchester United. The Portuguese legend had set his sight on a move away this summer to carry on playing in the Champions League.  But United‚Äôs refusal to consider selling the 37-year-old ‚Äì as well as a lack of clubs capable of meeting his salary of more than ¬£500,000-a-week ‚Äì is likely to see him remain at Old Trafford.  Ten Hag said as much ahead of the weekend's match against Brentford, as he says all indications point to Ronaldo staying put. Asked about Ronaldo‚Äôs determination to leave, Ten Hag said: ‚ÄúThat is not what he is telling me.‚Äù The Dutchman added: ‚ÄúWe already confirmed that he is in our plans. We plan with him so we also plan around him.‚Äù Ronaldo rocked United with news that he wanted to go less than a year after his emotional return to the club.  The forward doubted his chances of challenging for major silverware this season ‚Äì and was also determined to continue playing at the highest level in the Champions League.  United always maintained that he was not for sale ‚Äì and made it clear that he would be expected to see out the final year of his contract, which also has the option of a further 12 months.  Ten Hag has been impressed with Ronaldo‚Äôs application in training and could start him against Brentford on Saturday.  The United manager added: ‚ÄúI deal with the players we have and we plan with him for this season. We are happy with him and we have to fit him into the team so he has to come at the right fitness levels so that he can do the job that we expect him to do.‚Äù Ten Hag has also told Marcus Rashford to forget about a move to Paris Saint-Germain after it emerged the French giants are interested in the England international.  United also insist Rashford is not for sale.  ‚ÄúHe knows I love him, he knows I want him to be here, so I will tell him that again,‚Äù said Ten Hag. ‚ÄúHe showed already in the short time I‚Äôve been here, in pre-season, what he can do.  ‚ÄúAlso last week he was twice in a position where he could score. The team also with his contribution, he was in the right moment in the right place and I know and I trust he will finish in the future.‚Äù United are still trying to bring in at least one midfielder and a forward before the transfer window closes on September 1.  They are closing in on a deal for Adrien Rabiot after agreeing a fee worth around ¬£15million with Juventus.  They also hope to finally secure Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona, while PSV Eindhoven winger, Cody Gakpo, is an option up front.  Ten Hag insists there are no issues between him and United‚Äôs recruitment team over the failure to get deals done sooner.  ‚ÄúWe co-operate well and it is to my satisfaction,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was better to get the players in earlier because then you get them earlier in the process. Now in the department of midfield and offence you have seen when we have one injury then we have a problem. That‚Äôs clear. ‚ÄúOf course there developments in the transfer market, but still we have to get the players in who can contribute and not get players in who cannot.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-united-manager-ten-hag-gives-clearest-indication/bltbaaeee789ecadbc6,James Robson,2bc4352a-c244-413e-8ffd-2cb9304ca452
Former Liverpool chairman Broughton in talks to form consortium to buy Chelsea from Abramovich as bid deadline looms,"Sir¬†Martin Broughton, the British businessman who rescued Liverpool from a bitter boardroom in 2010, is eyeing a bid for Chelsea as the club remains for sale following sanctions against owner Roman Abramovich. At least 10 interested parties are interested in Chelsea amid Abramovich's impending sale, with that process currently on hold following sanctions levied against the Russian owner and his assets. And Broughton is now looking to get involved as the bidding process heats up. Broughton, a boyhood Chelsea fan, has held talks about playing a role in bids that are already being prepared, GOAL can confirm.  Additionally, Broughton is negotiating with potential backers about tabling his own bid, although there are concerns about whether or not he could raise enough money to enter the race before Friday's deadline. Broughton, a former British Airways chairman, is best known for orchestrating the sale of Liverpool to Fenway Sports Group in 2010, ending the disastrous ownership tenure of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.  He was appointed the club's chairman in April 2010 and was tasked with expediting the sale of the club to new owners. He was succeeded as chairman by Tom Werner once the takeover was complete. In the years since FSG took over, Liverpool have returned to the top of English football, having won the Champions League and Premier League under their current owners.  Broughton is the only person to have aided in an ownership change at the behest of the UK government, which he did at Liverpool alongside the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland, the club's biggest lender.  He currently chairs Sports Investment Partners, a private firm that has backed businesses in areas like sports technology and event management.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/former-liverpool-chairman-broughton-talks-consortium-buy-chelsea-/blt88702586cdcc7347,By Nizaar Kinsella,1c444374-f2f7-461d-a5ef-9385f2bd16a0
'The Turf Generation' - Inside Iceland's incredible success,"When Iceland take to the pitch on Monday night, they‚Äôll do so knowing a win will secure their place in the knockout rounds of the Women‚Äôs Euros. However, their opponent will be a nation with a capital city more than five times the size of its entire population. Less than 370,000 people live in Iceland, a number that equates to just 17 per cent of the inhabitants of Paris. Given that stark contrast, that the two are meeting at a major tournament is remarkable in itself. ‚ÄúWe know we don't have the same strengths as France,‚Äù defender Glodis Viggosdottir told GOAL ahead of the game. ‚ÄúThey have more technical players. They're probably faster than most of our players. ‚ÄúBut we just know what our strengths are and we focus on them. When it comes down to it, it's just football. It's just 11 against 11.‚Äù Iceland is the smallest country ever to qualify for a Euros, on both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs side. The former famously knocked out England in 2016 at their first major tournament appearance, then qualified for the World Cup two years later. The latter is the goal for the women now, who are appearing at their fourth successive Euros. So while participation at these huge competitions is incredible, it‚Äôs not something new either ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not just being there that counts for this country. Thorsteinn Halldorsson, head coach of the women‚Äôs national team, laughs when GOAL asks for the secret of how they do so much with so little. ‚ÄúIf I knew, I would be selling it all over the place!‚Äù he responds. Iceland with the Viking clap at full time with their fans üëèüèº #ISL #WEURO2022 pic.twitter.com/BO9viEjNlr But there is not necessarily one magical factor that means this small island can compete with ‚Äì and beat ‚Äì some of the biggest and best footballing countries on the planet. Asmundur Haraldsson is Halldorsson‚Äôs assistant and has been working with the Football Association of Iceland (KSI) since 2013. He‚Äôs well-versed in the country‚Äôs set-up, then, which has played a key role in its success. ‚ÄúFrom the age of four or five, whenever you're ready to play, you get into the club system and then anyone can play until whenever. There's not really a selection to it. You never get cut from a team or anything like that, so we have about 99 per cent accuracy in that,‚Äù he tells GOAL, with a chuckle at his stat. ‚ÄúWe don't have this academy system,‚Äù Halldorsson explained. ‚ÄúYou're not picked out when you're 10 years old and you have to stop or go to some other worse team. You can always be in your own team until you're at least 19. The system is quite good.‚Äù In that system are high quality coaches, too, rather than just anyone volunteering. Every coach needs a UEFA B Licence, even if they‚Äôre only coaching a junior team, and those qualifications are both cheap and often funded by clubs. As a coach gets to working with older age groups, that criteria becomes a UEFA A Licence. With the youth teams, the KSI will often bring 15-or-16-year-olds in to assist and learn as they are picking up their coaching badges, too, while specific goalkeeping coaches are incredibly common, even going down to around the under-12 level. ‚ÄúWe take great pride in the coaching education in Iceland,‚Äù Haraldsson says. What it creates is an incredibly well coached pool of players, which is certainly evident in the young generation coming through now who have benefited most from the growth of the set-up ‚Äì which includes more divisions and also better facilities. ‚ÄúWe call them the turf generation in Iceland, because they didn't have to play on the sh*t grass,‚Äù Viggosdottir explains, referring to the likes of Bayern Munich‚Äôs Karolina Lea Vilhjalmsdottir, aged 20, and Wolfsburg winger Sveindis Jonsdottir, aged 21. ‚ÄúThey are very good with the ball and I think that gives us a lot.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just about the quality of the youngsters, though. The generations before them paved the way to where Iceland is today, going back to the team that, in 2007, beat France 1-0 in a qualifying campaign that ended with tickets to Euro 2009, the country‚Äôs first ever senior major tournament on the men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs side. There are players in this team that have been at the highest level for a long time ‚Äì such as captain Sara Bjork Gunnarsdottir, who is a two-time Champions League winner with Lyon ‚Äì and those a little older than that ‚Äòturf generation‚Äô who are there now, such as Viggosdottir herself, who signed for Bayern last summer. ‚ÄúWe have more players that are playing out in the big clubs in Europe, which means you play these [big] games many times per year,‚Äù the defender explains. ‚ÄúComing [to the Euros] isn't a huge difference from when you're playing with your club. I think that experience makes a very big difference.‚Äù While it has become an overused clich√© to reference a team‚Äôs great ‚Äòblend‚Äô of youth and experience, Iceland really has it, but with the latter group having lots of top level exposure, too. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of young players playing senior football,‚Äù Haraldsson adds. ‚ÄúA few years ago, we only had two leagues. Now, we have four, so we have a bigger pool of players to select from. ‚ÄúIn the next five years to 10 years, players from Iceland are going to be technically better, tactically better and physically stronger. If we're going to keep up with international football, we have to take care of the foundation in our country to be able to keep up with everyone else.‚Äù The biggest leagues are already seeing the value of Icelandic players. A scroll through Halldorsson‚Äôs squad for the Euros and you‚Äôll see the names of many huge clubs ‚Äì Bayern, Milan, Juventus and more. ‚ÄúI think it's more or less due to mentality,‚Äù Haraldsson says, talking about those thriving abroad. ‚Äú[Icelandic players] adapt. They can cope with change, they can cope with negative things, they can cope with difficult times, being in and out of the team. Whatever it is, they can cope with it. It's just a strong mentality, I think, what the players possess.‚Äù That‚Äôs a key element of this small country‚Äôs success that simply cannot be noted and copied. When GOAL asks Viggosdottir what gives her such unwavering belief that Iceland can beat France on Monday, she doesn‚Äôt need to take a pause to think. She knows the answer. ‚ÄúI think it's just how we are as Icelandic people,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe always believe that we can beat anyone and I think that's a huge part of why we have success as well, because we have 400,000 people to choose from and we still make it to these big tournaments and we're doing well. It‚Äôs just like, 'Nobody is too big for us.' We believe that we can do it.‚Äù A side effect of that is the incredible team spirit it creates, with Haraldsson highlighting the ‚Äúmindset‚Äù but also the ‚Äúunity‚Äù within. ‚ÄúThe players are very tight, the staff is tight, and the whole group is tight,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúThat's one of the things that we're working on very closely, to create that team unity. That's the thing that's going to hopefully push us through to the knockout stage.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs players, we want the best for each other,‚Äù Viggosdottir adds. ‚ÄúWe don't have individuals that are just thinking about themselves. We will do whatever we can to back each other up. If somebody has been beaten, somebody else is there to back them up and I think that's special and that's a team that I want to play for. That's so important.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just on the pitch that such unity shines through. When Iceland faced Italy on Thursday evening, a game that ended in a draw that disappointed both teams in their bid for a quarter-final berth, the scenes at the full-time whistle encapsulated as much. Led by those packed into the far stand, almost the entirety of the Manchester City Academy stadium engaged in the famous Viking clap, fans from the Nordic nation having taken over the city for its two fixtures at the ground. Add that incredible support into the equation and it‚Äôs just another reason for Iceland to believe they can pull off a shock result. ‚ÄúI think the biggest thing that we take from this is, we haven't lost yet,‚Äù Viggosdottir said after that game. ‚ÄúWe haven't lost a game and if we can keep it to zero against France, I think we are a team that can always score. ""We're really good at set pieces, we have our counterattacks and I think the team we have now, on a good day, we can beat France. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a final for us. We have to win. We have to give it our all. Either way it goes, we're going to leave it all on the field.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-turf-generation-inside-iceland-incredible-success/blt1bc78093fd9ddb0c,Ame√© Ruszkai,347dad7f-f7dd-4799-b983-3915cfc94074
"Best & worst value Premier League transfers 2021-22: From Grealish to Lukaku, Sancho to Tomiyasu","Premier League clubs have completed their transfer business for 2021-22, with the January window closing, with the hope being that shrewd judgement calls were made on those moved in and out. Not every deal can be a success, though, and English top-flight history is littered with tales of big-money flops and business that made plenty of sense on paper but failed to deliver on the field. In contrast, there are bargains to be found and deals to be done that end up exceeding expectations. GOAL takes a look at both sides of that value coin when it comes to recruitment in the current campaign. Arsenal find themselves back in the hunt for a top-four finish this season, with Mikel Arteta looking to bring a five-year absence from Champions League competition to a close. Inconsistency has remained an issue for the Gunners at times, but transfer business has been largely positive and considerable value has been found in Takehiro Tomiyasu. The Japan international full-back cost just ¬£17 million ($23m) when being prised away from Bologna, but he has taken in 17 appearances across all competitions and contributed to the collection of eight clean sheets. Another London-based defender that has been catching the eye is Crystal Palace star Marc Guehi, who made the short journey from Chelsea to Selhurst Park last summer. He is the Eagles‚Äô third-most expensive capture of all time, coming in at ¬£18 million ($24m), but has helped to make Patrick Vieira‚Äôs side a tougher nut to crack and appears destined to step up from the U21 ranks and into the senior England international fold at some stage. Another former Chelsea academy graduate thriving outside of west London is Tino Livramento, who cost Southampton just ¬£5m ($7m) and has a ¬£50m ($67m) buy-back clause in his contract if his former club decide that they made a mistake on a defender currently nursing a knee injury. On the subject of making a quick buck, Manchester City will feel that Ferran Torres‚Äô winter switch to Barcelona represents good business for them. The Spain international is only 21 years of age and has plenty of potential still to be unlocked but, having been acquired by the Premier League champions for ‚Ç¨23m (¬£19m/$26m), he was offloaded to Camp Nou for ‚Ç¨55m (¬£46m/$62m) after making just 43 appearances for the Blues ‚Äì a price rise of 42 per cent in less than 18 months. City have also been involved in another deal that could be considered shrewd, although they currently find themselves on the wrong side of a value line this time. ùôäùô£ùôö ùôùùô™ùô£ùôôùôßùôöùôô ùô¢ùôûùô°ùô°ùôûùô§ùô£ ùô•ùô§ùô™ùô£ùôôùô®.Manchester City have signed Jack Grealish for a British record transfer fee! üîµ(impeccable timing üòâ) pic.twitter.com/Hb3sLPSij1 The Blues smashed the British transfer record when luring Jack Grealish away from Aston Villa for ¬£100m ($135m), with those in the West Midlands initially reluctant to part with a home-grown superstar that had become a talismanic presence for them. Villa have, however, invested wisely elsewhere after seeing their coffers bolstered, while the England international playmaker has struggled to find a spark in the north west. Grealish has cost City over ¬£16.6m ($22m) per goal involvement through his opening 23 appearances ‚Äì with three assists and three efforts of his own recorded ‚Äì and while he is on course to land a Premier League title winners‚Äô medal in 2022, the Villans will be laughing all the way to the bank. Steven Gerrard and Co deserve an honourable mention for having managed to acquire Philippe Coutinho‚Äôs English top-flight know-how on loan from Barcelona ‚Äì as he helps to fill a Grealish-shaped void ‚Äì while Christian Eriksen could prove to be a shrewd addition for Brentford if much-publicised health issues do not hold the ex-Tottenham midfielder back in west London. While Grealish‚Äôs move to Manchester was the biggest deal done in the summer of 2022, Romelu Lukaku‚Äôs return to Chelsea was not far behind. The Belgium international striker was taken back to Stamford Bridge from Serie A title holders Inter in a transfer worth ¬£98m ($132m). Big things were expected of him in England ‚Äì having previously starred for West Brom, Everton and Manchester United ‚Äì but he has made more headlines with his off-field activity, including questionable interviews, than he has for his exploits on the pitch. Lukaku is not happy at Chelsea üò¨ pic.twitter.com/tEWAVNzsv7 Lukaku has registered only eight goals through 24 appearances in all competitions, with each of those efforts costing Chelsea ¬£12.3m ($17m) ‚Äì while every outing comes in at over ¬£4m ($5m). A man sitting in a similar boat at present is England international winger Jadon Sancho, with his move from Borussia Dortmund not playing out as planned. A long-running saga eventually delivered a ¬£73m ($99m) switch to Manchester United, but the talented 21-year-old has struggled to make the desired impact in his homeland. He has just two goals and no assists to his name through 23 games, has made only 10 Premier League starts and has seen each of the 938 minutes he has played in the English top tier cost United close to ¬£78,000. Another of those to have left the Red Devils scratching collective heads is Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek. He may well come good at Everton, if regular opportunities are afforded to him by Frank Lampard, but for now he remains an expensive flop at Old Trafford. Snapped up from Ajax for ¬£35m ($47m) during the summer of 2020, Van de Beek has cost United ¬£700,000 for each of his 50 appearances and ¬£60,000 per Premier League minute ‚Äì with only 579 seen so far. Tanguy Ndombele has proved to be just as costly for Tottenham, with the north London giants finally moving their record signing out on loan to former employers Lyon on January deadline day. He swapped that Ligue 1 outfit for Spurs in July 2019, with ¬£63m ($85m) changing hands, but the France international never really found his feet on English soil and has retraced his steps to familiar surroundings having cost Tottenham ¬£692,000 for each of his 91 appearances and close to ¬£17,500 per minute in the league. Bryan Gil ‚Äì Ndombele‚Äôs team-mate at Spurs ‚Äì gets a dishonourable mention for having returned to his native Spain on loan at Valencia after taking in just 20 appearances and 85 minutes of Premier League football (¬£258,000 for each of those) on the back of a ¬£22m ($30m) move from Sevilla in the summer of 2021.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/best-worst-value-premier-league-transfers-2021-22-grealish/blt346263f85f88119c,Chris Burton,47e3a610-1741-4212-878d-ee2effedcfee
'We are failing' - Texas school shooting prompts emotional plea from Austin owner McConaughey,"Austin FC owner Matthew McConaughey demanded action after a school shooting in his hometown of Uvalde, Texas, killed at least 21 people, 19 of whom were children, on Tuesday. The actor and MLS investor was one of many sports-associated figures in the United States to show outrage after the tragedy, which continued a devastating, decades-long epidemic of mass shootings in the country. McConaughey called the incident one Americans ""can control"" but are failing to do so amid political strife. ""As you all are aware there was another mass shooting today, this time in my home town of Uvalde, Texas,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Once again, we have tragically proven that we are failing to be responsible for the rights our freedoms grant us. ""The true call to action now is for every American to take a longer and deeper look in the mirror, and ask ourselves, 'What is it that we truly value? How do we repair the problem? What small sacrifices can we individually take today, to preserve a healthier and safer nation, state, and neighborhood tomorrow?' We cannot exhale once again, make excuses, and accept these tragic realities as the status quo. ""As Americans, Texans, mothers and fathers, it's time we re-evaluate, and renegotiate our wants from our needs. We have to rearrange our values and find a common ground above this devastating American reality that has tragically become our children's issue.""

"Chelsea vs Real Madrid: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Champions League holders Chelsea welcome the most successful team in the history of the competition to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday evening, as Real Madrid visit west London in the first leg of their quarter-final tie. Thomas Tuchel's side head into the clash following a shock 4-1 derby defeat at home to Brentford at the weekend, while Carlo Ancelotti's men are 12 points clear at the top of La Liga following a hard-fought 2-1 win at Celta Vigo. Domestic matters, however, will be put to one side by both teams on Wednesday as they focus on their shared goal of claiming more continental success. The Blues are favourites with bet365 to claim a first-leg victory, priced at 11/10 (2.10) and Chelsea recorded a 2-0 home win against Real Madrid when they met in the semi-finals of last season's competitions. Los Blancos, meanwhile, can be backed at 13/5 (3.60) while the draw is on offer at 12/5 (3.40). Romelu Lukaku is the shortest-priced player to break the deadlock on Wednesday evening with the Belgium international available at 9/2 (5.50). For Real Madrid, Karim Benzema is offered at 5/1 (6.00) and the Frenchman is enjoying his best ever scoring season for the Spanish side having already netted 34 goals in all competitions, including eight in the Champions League. Elsewhere in the market, Kai Havertz and Mason Mount are both priced at 11/2 (6.50) while Vinicius Junior is available at 8/1 (9.00). The Premier League side were clearly superior to their Spanish opponents in last season's semi-final although the tie was still in the balance until the Blues scored a second goal in the second leg, five minutes before the end of the game. This season Real Madrid are generally in better shape, although there is a feeling that Carlo Ancelotti's men are running out of steam heading into the business end of the season. Los Blancos found their midfield overrun last year by the energy of N'Golo Kante, Jorginho and Mason Mount and there is every chance that Ancelotti decides to play a fourth man in the middle of the park to try and find some equilibrium. Keeping things tight and staying in the tie for the second leg will be the main concern of the visitors and as such backing another low-scoring game between these sides makes sense. Under 2.5 goals is priced at 8/11 (1.73) and paid out in both legs of their semi-final last season, while opposing both teams to score at 10/11 (1.91) could also be of interest.

"Ronaldo chilling on the beach in Dubai, Mount & Jorginho in Miami: Where are Premier League stars holidaying during the winter break?","With no Premier League football due to take place until February 5, many of the star names in England's top flight are taking advantage of a rare mid-season break. The likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kevin De Bruyne, Jorginho and many more have decided to head abroad having been given club-sanctioned time off, allowing them to rest and recharge ahead of the final months of the 2021-22 campaign. GOAL takes a look at where some of the biggest names in the Premier League have gone abroad, with Dubai proving a popular escape. Plenty of Manchester United stars have made the trip to Dubai, including Cristiano Ronaldo, who has been active on social media during the winter break, posting images of himself with partner Georgina Rodriguez and his children. Marcus Rashford is also in the United Arab Emirates, where he has shown off how he is working on his fitness as he aims to become a regular in Ralf Rangnick's starting XI at Old Trafford. Speculation regarding Jesse Lingard's future is rife, with GOAL able to confirm that talks with Newcastle over a loan switch are on the verge of a collapse, and he has also jetted off to Dubai for some warm-weather training. Bruno Fernandes is another who has been spotted carrying out training drills during his time off, although the midfielder decided to head back to Portugal to work with high-performance coach Mario Ferreira. England centre-back Harry Maguire, meanwhile, has been playing golf with Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, although there's no chance of a vacation for the likes of Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles and Fred, who are away on international duty. Premier League leaders Manchester City are also taking the chance to soak up the sun and get away this week, with Kevin De Bruyne having headed out to the Maldives for a break with his family. Jack Grealish and Ruben Dias, meanwhile, are both in Dubai, as is Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn, and Portugal international Bernardo Silva is enjoying a break away in Sri Lanka. Ederson and Gabriel Jesus have joined up with the Brazil national team for their World Cup qualifying fixtures against Ecuador and Paraguay, while Zack Steffen is away with the United States. City's goalscorer in the 1-1 draw with Southampton, Aymeric Laporte, is relaxing in the sunshine in the Bahamas, and team-mate Ilkay Gundogan opted for a trip to the United States, where he's been staying in Los Angeles. He's not the only Premier League player to head Stateside, with Chelsea duo Mason Mount and Jorginho having been spotted catching an NBA game in Miami, as they watched the Heat's win over New York Knicks at the FTX Arena. Despite the much-publicised on-pitch discussion between Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech during the Blues' 1-1 draw with Brighton earlier in January, the duo have been spotted on holiday together in an unknown location. Another pair of Chelsea stars holidaying together are Germany international duo Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, with the players, along with their partners, posting an image on Instagram together in the desert. Centre-back Antonio Rudiger, whose future remains up in the air with his contract running down, took a trip to Sierra Leone, where he was given a rapturous welcome after arriving in the country of his mother's birth. Callum Hudson-Odoi, meanwhile, has also jetted off to Africa to visit Ghana, who he could still represent at international level, despite having earned three full caps for England. As well as Edouard Mendy, who is on Afcon duty with Senegal, Christian Pulisic is also away on international duty with USMNT, who have a busy schedule of World Cup qualifiers against El Salvador, Canada and Honduras, and Thiago Silva is with Brazil. A selection of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool players have also travelled abroad, with James Milner, Andrew Robertson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all in Dubai. Roberto Firmino, his wife Larissa Pereira and their children are also clearly in warmer climes, while Curtis Jones has made the trip to LA, with his girlfriend Saffie Khan. The likes of Alisson and Fabinho are away with Brazil, while Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are still participating at Afcon and have made it through to the quarter-final stage. Takumi Minamino is with the Japan squad and featured in the 2-0 win over China on January 27. Arsenal, meanwhile, will head to Dubai for a training camp until February 2, with Mikel Arteta using the trip to bring the players together, as well as it being an opportunity to work on fitness and tactics. Indeed, several players, including Gabriel Martinelli and Bernd Leno, have already travelled to the United Arab Emirates, as they get in some rest and recuperation ahead of the rest of the squad flying out.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-beach-dubai-mount-jorginho-miami-premier-league/bltd82e51011a534d67,Stephen Darwin,6f2a9067-e864-45ea-83ca-0b076b222e5c
Revealed: What will Christian Eriksen's Man Utd squad number be?,"Christian Eriksen is a Manchester United player, having linked up with the Red Devils on July 15, and will be eager to make an immediate impression at Old Trafford. After many years of being linked with the Premier League giants, the Denmark international is finally on their books, joining as a free agent after spending the second half of last season at Brentford. He returned to competitive action with the Bees after recovering from a cardiac arrest suffered at Euro 2020, with his exploits in west London convincing United to make a move. At 30 years of age, and with useful experience of life in England under his belt from spells at Tottenham and Brentford, Eriksen is expected to star for Erik Ten Hag‚Äôs new-look side, but what number will he have on his back? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ The Denmark international is an archetypal No.10, with his creative qualities allowing him to slip seamlessly into that role. United already have somebody filling that spot, though, in the form of Marcus Rashford, so an alternative jersey had to be taken on. The Red Devils revealed that Eriksen will wear the No. 14 shirt as he slots into Ten Hag‚Äôs squad. His integration into new surroundings were delayed slightly by a pre-season tour of Asia and Australia but United have now returned to Europe, ahead of friendly dates against Atletico Madrid in Oslo and Rayo Vallecano at Old Trafford, meaning that Eriksen can start to see game time.

Who is Hansjorg Wyss? Chelsea-linked Swiss billionaire's net worth & profile,"Elite-level football teams are often owned by millionaires and billionaires, with many of them becoming household names among fans of the sport. In early 2022, amid the uncertainty surrounding Roman Abramovich's ownership of Premier League club Chelsea, an abundantly wealthy individual named Hansjorg Wyss revealed that he, along with three others, had been offered the chance to buy the Stamford Bridge outfit. He is certainly interested, so who is Wyss, how much is he worth and how did he make his money? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Hansjorg Wyss is a billionaire businessman from Switzerland. Born on September 19, 1935 in the Swiss capital Bern, Wyss made his fortune through Synthes, a company he founded in the 1970s which manufactures medical devices. Educated at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich in the late 1950s, he later studied in the United States at Harvard Business School as he sought to develop his career. He has been based in the U.S. since the 1960s. As well as medical manufacturing, Wyss' career has also seen him work in government infrastructure services, the steel industry and he has also sold aircraft. Wyss, who celebrated his 86th birthday in 2021, sold Synthes to pharmaceutical multinational Johnson and Johnson in 2012 for a fee reported to be in the region of $20 billion (¬£15bn). Chelsea are up for sale, according to one potential buyer ü§Ø In a March 2022 interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, Wyss explained: ""Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England. He also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly. I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich. ""I have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him ¬£2 billion. But Chelsea has no money. ""As of today, we don't know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. ""What I can already say: I'm definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then it would be with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors."" Wyss' net worth was estimated at $5.1 billion (¬£3.8bn) in 2022, according to American business magazine Forbes. His wealth came primarily from the operation of Synthes and it was significantly boosted when he sold that company. As well as medical device manufacturing, Wyss is known for his philanthropy and has donated money to a variety of causes, including climate initiatives, education and conservation efforts. The Wyss Foundation was established in 1998 as an environmental protection project, designed to preserve, in particular, Wyoming's Hoback Basin area so that people could continue to enjoy outdoor pursuits, such as hiking and fishing, there. In 2008, he donated $125 million to Harvard for the establishment of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Forbes describes him as ""one of the most philanthropic people in the world"" and, in 2018, he committed to investing $1 billion over 10 years in order to ""accelerate land and ocean conservation efforts"" across the world. ""This money will support locally-led conservation efforts around the world, push for increased global targets for land and ocean protection, seek to raise public awareness about the importance of this effort, and fund scientific studies to identify the best strategies to reach our target,"" Wyss wrote in the New York Times at the time. It is reported that Wyss' charitable foundation, which has worked with celebrities such as Leonardo Di Caprio, has over $2 billion in assets, meaning he possesses the clout to fund initiatives.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-hansjorg-wyss-net-worth-profile/blt5ccce24724610b12,Ryan Kelly,ea02e70b-42f3-4c99-b586-acadbef88ebf
'I want this nightmare to end as soon as possible' - Ukraine goalkeeper Trubin praying for peace,"Imagine spending your entire career at one club yet never playing at its home stadium or even training at its state-of-art facilities. That is the story of Anatoliy Trubin, the 20-year-old Shakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper, nicknamed the ""Ukrainian Courtois"", and widely seen as one of the brightest talents in the country. In 2014, at the age of just 13, Trubin was forced to abandon his home and move to Kyiv in order to continue playing for Shakhtar. And now, he is a refugee in his country once again, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made life in the capital impossible. ""Our youth team was just about to move to Shakhtar's main training centre in 2014, because that's what happens starting from the Under-13 teams,"" Trubin explains in an exclusive interview with GOAL. ""However, the military situation began, and things became unclear. For a long while, we didn't even know if there would still be a team at all. ""Then, in August, we were told to pack and move to the Kyiv region if we wanted to stay at the academy."" The kid's life had changed, totally and unexpectedly. ""Our family lived just a few minutes from the Shakhtar training ground, and it was supposed to be very comfortable. All of a sudden, I had to leave home,"" he says. ""It was very difficult for me and my parents, who at times didn't see me for about six months. They knew that I love football, and I guess they just couldn‚Äôt prevent me from going. ""I was just following my dream, but in very different circumstances."" üíôüíõ Kyiv üá∫üá¶üôè#FootballStandsTogether#StandWithUkraine#–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ #Ukraine #–ö–∏—ó–≤ #Kyiv pic.twitter.com/XY5n8QN2N3 It has been a long and painful story for Trubin. The world only started paying attention to the conflict this year but it all started eight years ago, when separatists, strongly supported by Russia, began military actions, aiming to achieve independence for the Donbass region. Many people in Donetsk speak Russian as their mother tongue, which is perfectly normal and logical, given its history in the Soviet Union, which united all of the republics in the same country. It is noteworthy that Russian is the default language at Shakhtar's official website. That doesn't mean, however, that they support Russia's aggression ‚Äì quite the contrary. Trubin, who speaks Russian, claims: ""I don‚Äôt know anyone who wouldn't like Donetsk to stay part of Ukraine. Donetsk is Ukraine, and it can only flourish as an Ukrainian city. It was a magnificent prosperous town, the city of roses. ""I just want this war to be over as soon as possible, so that things can be as they were. How could anyone support this aggression, when peaceful people are dying? ""Such a situation helped me to grow mentally faster. Maybe that is the reason why my progress was quite fast."" Trubin made his Shakhtar debut in May 2019, aged just 17, and started playing regularly less than a year later. His Champions League debut was quite sensational, in a 3-2 win against Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu, with Trubin beating the real Thibaut Courtois. ""Our Brazilian players gave me that nickname, because I am tall like him ‚Äì 199cm,"" he says. ""He is not my role model, because I grew up admiring Iker Casillas, Petr Cech and Edwin van der Sar. ""But it was obviously great to play against him in the Champions League and win. We greeted each other after the final whistle, and wished each other luck."" Shakhtar played in the Champions League this season as well, but now that feels like a distant memory, following the Russian invasion that started on February 24. ""We didn't think it could really happen,"" he admits. Nobody expected Russia to be so barbaric and cruel. This really is a nightmare. I don‚Äôt understand how they are capable of it. ""They ruined so many beautiful towns and killed so many civilians. That is a catastrophe. ""Up until 2014, we just considered Russia to be a neighbour. There were no bad feelings between people in the two countries. It was unthinkable that war could start, first in Donetsk and then in all of Ukraine. ""But now, Russia doesn't exist for me as a country anymore. I think it would take a very long time for the wounds to heal."" The tragedy of Mariupol, besieged and almost totally destroyed by Russian aggressors, is very personal for Trubin. ""It is almost my second town,"" he says. ""As kids, we used to train and play there quite a lot. We also went there with my family for seaside vacations. ""My girlfriend is from Mariupol, and all her family lived there. Thankfully, they now managed to escape."" üá∫üá¶ Mariupol üíî#StopRussianAggression#–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞ #Ukraine#StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/n39Hve93dh He keeps in touch daily with his family in Donetsk. ""Only when I joined the first-team squad three years ago was there an opportunity to bring my mother and sister to live with me,"" he reveals. ""But my father, grandmother, uncle and aunt are still in Donetsk. ""They are relatively safe, even though there are severe problems with running water and electricity."" The keeper himself, together with his mother and sister, escaped to Lutsk in the west of the country. Ironically, it's the hometown of Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, once a legend of Ukrainian football, but now considered a traitor as he silently continues to work as assistant coach at Gazprom-owned Zenit. ""I would rather not talk about that man,"" Trubin says. ""We went to Lutsk because it was possible to find a place to live here. ""Some players went to other towns, like Uzhhorod and Lviv. There is a pitch here, and I am trying to train and keep myself in form, but that is not easy."" Whereas the foreign players were allowed to leave the country, the situation is different for Ukrainians. ""Men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave,"" he explains. ""There might have been interest from certain clubs, and I might have loved to join a foreign club temporarily. ""But that is impossible without getting permission from the Ministry of Sports of the Football Association. ""I could have been more useful for the country by playing abroad, rather than just sitting here and doing nothing."" The young keeper was part of Ukraine's Euro 2020 squad, even though he didn't play. Now, that national team must start thinking about the World Cup qualifying fixture against Scotland that was postponed until June because of the war. The winner will face Wales in the playoff for the place in Qatar. ""This is another important aspect. I wish I could at least find a team in order to train regularly. It is much better to train with a squad rather than do it all by myself,"" Trubin says. However, while the World Cup is important, peace is all that matters to Ukrainians right now. ""I want this nightmare to end as soon as possible, and for us to get our country back to normal,"" he says. ""Then, my biggest dream is to return to Donetsk and play at Donbass Arena. It was impossible for many years, but I believe that day will come.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nightmare-end-ukraine-goalkeeper-trubin-praying-for-end-to/bltba71283668cda413,Michael Yokhin,7bd07808-3587-4ca5-9b23-9795f243c38f
'Our fans were victims' - Real Madrid demand answers for Stade de France Champions League final chaos,"Real Madrid have demanded answers from authorities for the Champions League final chaos at Stade de France ""in defence of our supporters who were victims"" of the poor organisation. Madrid beat Liverpool 1-0 in the showpiece event on May 28 thanks to a second-half goal from Vinicius Junior, landing Europe's most prestigious prize for a record-extending 14th time. The contest was marred by dangerous events outside of the stadium, though, with the original kick-off time delayed by 30 minutes after a large number of fans forced their way in without tickets. Police used tear gas and pepper spray on supporters left stranded outside the venue despite having valid matchday passes as others were seen jumping the barriers to gain entry. Madrid have released an official statement asking for a full explanation for the ugly scenes, which reads: ""In light of the unfortunate events which took place on the¬†28th of May in the surroundings of and at access points to the Stade de France, and even inside the stadium itself, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to express the following in defence of our fans, who were victim to said events. ""We would like to know the reasons which led to this venue being chosen to host the final and the criteria used, taking into account the experiences of the day. ""Furthermore, we call for answers and explanations in order to determine those responsible for leaving the fans abandoned and defenceless. Fans who in general terms showed exemplary conduct at all times.¬† ""We believe something which should have been a wonderful festival of football for all fans who attended the game, quickly turned into a series of unfortunate events which have caused a sense of outrage around the world.¬† ""As was evident in the revealing¬†images published by the media, several fans were attacked, harassed, assaulted and robbed in violent fashion. These occurrences¬†continued as they moved in their cars or busses, causing concern for their physical wellbeing. Certain fans even had to spend the night in hospital as a result of injuries.¬† ""Football has transmitted an image to the world which is far away from the values and goals which it should pursue. ""Our fans and supporters deserve a response and those responsible to be held accountable in order for events like these to be eradicated from football and sport in general."" Liverpool have also been outspoken in their criticism of the organisation of the final, with club chairman Tom Werner demanding an apology from the French government for failing to acknowledge the ""incredibly dangerous"" set-up. UEFA initially blamed the supporters that tried to get into Stade de France without tickets for the disorder, but European football's main governing body has since commissioned an independent review. An official statement said that the ""decision making, responsibility and behaviours of all entities involved in the final"" will all be thoroughly examined before any next steps are taken. The story of a terrifying night in Paris.@neiljonesgoal speaks to the Liverpool fans who were locked out of the Stade de France & then targeted by locals as they left. It may have taken them a while, but Real Madrid‚Äôs ‚Äòcomunicado oficial‚Äô debunks, once and for all, the myth that the problems at the Stade de France were limited solely to Liverpool supporters. Those of us present at the stadium - myself included - already knew this. We had seen the videos and heard first-hand accounts from fans. Whichever end of the ground you were sat in, the issues were similar; long, tightly-packed queues, inadequate ticket checkpoints, heavy-handed policing and the lingering threat of gangs of youths around the stadium perimeter. Both before and after the game, fans were left fearing for their safety. Unacceptable, at the biggest game in European club football.¬† Heartbreaking to experience & witnessed what went wrong in Paris in the @ChampionsLeague final.The French let the fans down and they knew they got it wrong. They are now trying to cover their mess as they will be hosting the Olympic Games. Please retweet@LFC @JamesPearceLFC pic.twitter.com/jtT6EDAcUy For those supporters to then be held responsible by politicians simply added insult to injury. This is not a club-specific issue, it is a matter of security and safety, and one which supporters of all clubs should be united behind. Billy Hogan, the Liverpool chief executive, has been in contact with his Madrid counterparts all week, keen to foster a more united approach as answers are sought from both UEFA and the French authorities. Liverpool, it should also be pointed out, have concerns about the man appointed to head UEFA‚Äôs ‚Äòindependent‚Äô report into the final. Dr Tiago Brandao Rodrigues will lead the inquiry, but there are fears that he may have links with UEFA through his close work with Tiago Craveiro, the former chief executive of the Portuguese Football Federation, who now acts as a senior adviser to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin. It is clear, given the performances this week of Gerald Darmanin, the French interior minister, and Amelie Oudea-Castera, the sports minister, that a long battle lies ahead for supporters, many of whom are still coming to terms with the events of last weekend. Liverpool say more than 6,500 fans have submitted online forms detailing their experiences, and have pledged financial support to various mental health organisations, which can be used by supporters. And with Real Madrid now, belatedly, adding their weight to proceedings, the fight for the truth is now gathering even more pace.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/our-fans-were-victims-real-madrid-demand-answers-for-stade/blteca9ced8f51fb4bf,James Westwood,10f424b2-42ad-4957-b796-42de524bf7f5

'I have no regrets' - Josh Cavallo opens up on dealing with death threats after coming out as gay,"Coming from a close-knit family of Italian and Maltese descent, Josh Cavallo has leaned heavily on them for support in the four months since a video posted on social media made him one of the world's most famous footballers. The 22-year-old Adelaide United left-back, via a video posted to his and the club's accounts, came out as gay to the wider world on October 27 last year, thus becoming the only currently active male player in a top level league to do so. Thrust into the intense spotlight of becoming a role model overnight for much more than what he does on the pitch, Cavallo's Melbourne-based family was initially unable to support him in person due to Australia's tough coronavirus restrictions. Despite this, Cavallo ‚Äì an enthusiastic, instantly likeable character who speaks with enthusiasm and excitement about his unique career and life story so far ‚Äì says he could not have take such a momentous step without them. Speaking exclusively to GOAL via video link from Australia, Cavallo said: ""We spoke all the time on video calls, and on the phone, and they were incredible. Especially my brother Christian ‚Äì he has been an absolute weapon in supporting me."" Cavallo is also delighted with the outpouring of love and affection he has had from all over the football world since coming out. The only currently active male footballer to come out as gay.@JoshuaCavallo speaks exclusively to @emmasmithjourno üéô However, there has been a dark side, too, with vile homophobic abuse both in stadia and on social media. When Adelaide United faced rivals Melbourne Victory in the A-League on January 8, Cavallo was targeted with slurs, chants and abuse during the game. Victory were subsequently fined fined $5,000 AUD (¬£2,650), with Football Australia saying the money will be used to ‚Äúfurther invest in LGBTQ+ awareness and education initiatives‚Äù in the sport. The abuse continued online, with Cavallo subjected to death threats which are being investigated by police. It led the young man to post an emotional message to social media, calling for an end to the abuse and for online platforms to do more to stamp it out. But rather than looking for Victory or any group of fans to be dragged over the coals, he feels the only way is up for football as a whole. He says: ""At the time, I was disappointed, but now I see this as a learning moment for everyone to grow. As a professional athlete, no matter what sport you're in, it does affect you, it does get to you and it isn't a nice feeling. ""But I want to create awareness and show that it isn't ok to do that, no matter where you come from or what your beliefs are. ""We have children at these games, we have families, so we want to make it a respectable environment for everyone. pic.twitter.com/wGi7Cu1ws5 ""In sport, if you make mistakes on the field as an individual, if you miss a goal or a tackle or a cross, you will get negative comments on social media. I treat it no differently to that. ""I'm lucky, I have support around me, but for the person who doesn't have that and receives this abuse, it could hurt them a lot more, and I wanted to create this awareness. ""Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or whatever need to be aware of this, because some people might not be strong enough and it could have severe consequences. ""Through all this came some positivity ‚Äì Melbourne Victory got fined, and they donated to LGBT causes, which is an amazing step forward in Australian football. ""For me, it wasn't about punishment, it was about showing how this stuff still happens in 2022. ""When I came out, people asked, why does he have to announce it? These situations explain why it is still important. ""Growing up, I didn't have that gay role model, someone to look about to and say, 'He does what he loves and is able to be himself.' That's the representation I want to be for future generations. ""No matter where you come from, who you love or what you believe, as long as you're happy and do the thing you love, that's the most important thing. ""And you can still have a very successful career while being yourself ‚Äì I think I'm a prime example of that."" The subject of whether social media companies should require ID for an account to be created has been debated long and hard, especially in the shadow of footballers getting increasing levels of racist, sexist and homophobic abuse online. pic.twitter.com/CwrfpeWRVL For Cavallo, there is no debate. He says: ""For a huge platform like Instagram or Facebook, there needs to be a system where an account has to have some form of identification. ""You have to link it to an address, or be traceable to your identity in some way, so you can't just have scam accounts with one or two followers leaving nasty comments. ""If platforms have verification processes, we will have less of this abuse. In the real world, people would not say those comments online if they were face to face."" The Australian football community as a whole, and especially Adelaide United, have supported Cavallo, with the most official show so far coming with the staging of the first official A-League Pride Games, the equivalent of Rainbow Laces in the UK. For Cavallo, it is public confirmation of what he already knows about how much Adelaide have backed him, which he discovered when he informed his team-mates of the video he was about to feature in on October 27, 2021. He says: ""Twenty minutes before I pressed the post button, I was in the changing room with all my team-mates and coaches. I was very nervous, my heart was beating so quickly when I announced it. ""It was so emotional, something I'll remember for the rest of my life. Everyone gave me a big hug and said, 'We're so proud you can tell us who you really are.' ""What amazed me the most was that, 30 seconds after I made that announcement, me and the boys went straight back to talking about football and everything was normal again. ""That was exactly what I wanted, just to be accepted for who I was and not be treated any differently."" With being a gay player so often framed in football media as a source of angst and secrecy, with tabloid stories spreading Chinese whispers amid silhouetted pictures, and prominent ex-players and pundits bemoaning the lack of an out Premier League footballer and wondering who it could be, Cavallo looks back on the months since revealing his truth to the world ‚Äì and he feels only happiness. ""It has been phenomenal, it honestly feels like a dream come true,"" he says. ""From that time I clicked the post button on October 27, I can't explain to you how happy it has made me. ""The support I have got from my family, my team-mates, my peers, my friends, and worldwide was just phenomenal, and made me wonder why I had been hiding this for so long. ""It was a big relief, it had been a long time coming and I couldn't be prouder. To this day, I have no regrets about posting it, and announcing who I am to the world."" Other footballers who have come out while playing, such as former MLS player Collin Martin, have said that the pressures of playing while having the focus that comes with being that rarest of things in men's football ‚Äì openly LGBT+ ‚Äì have affected their performances negatively. It's not been a problem, though, for Cavallo, who feels he is now playing under less pressure than ever. Given he is no longer wrestling internally with his sexuality, he can put more energy into his football. ""Definitely,"" he says, when asked if the additional scrutiny has impacted him as a footballer. ""Before I came out I told my two coaches, and that was a massive weight off my shoulders. ""Now the whole world knows? I can't explain how good I feel and how free I am on the pitch. ""So, now it's just important that I can focus on being Josh Cavallo the footballer. That's how I want to be known, not as Josh Cavallo the gay footballer. Being gay is just one part of my life, it was my talent that got me where I am. ""It can be overwhelming at times, but I took it in my stride. It's crazy really, sometimes when I play I get both sets of fans cheering for me, fans from the opposition wanting photos after the game. ""There's something really special and gives me confidence to grow even more. There's a buzz inside me which makes me want to keep impressing and grow for the better. This is a fantastic opportunity."" Cavallo is embracing his new found status as a role model for young players, whether LGBT or not, which was something he lacked growing up. He agrees with his close friend Thomas Beattie, who told GOAL that a lack of education and support for academy players who might be struggling with their sexuality has led to many dropping out of the game, or in Beattie's case, struggling with their mental health throughout their career in the game. Cavallo wants to be as much of a visible role model as possible ‚Äì and is delighted to see some changes already happen as a result. ""Growing up I didn't have someone I could look up to, or find any acceptance anywhere to say it was ok to be gay and play football,"" he says. ""What really touched my heart was when I came out, my old junior team, Brighton Soccer Club in Melbourne, reached out and said that in honour of me, on the sleeves of their jersey they are going to have a Proud 2 Play logo [Proud 2 Play is a group which promotes LGBT+ inclusivity in Australian sport]. ""This is phenomenal ‚Äì any team Brighton play, kids will see that and know it is a safe place to be themselves. More clubs need to do that. ""We don't know if the next big talent has been turned away from the game because they don't fit in. I wish that in my youth football days, I had something like that."" #lgbwiththet ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶æ This feeling of exclusion, of not always feeling wanted in the sport he loves, has led Cavallo to be a vocal supporter of transgender people, including a short but brutal response to the trans-exclusionary LGB Alliance when they attempted to congratulate him on his public announcement. The one time Cavallo's perma-smile drops during our conversation is when discussing trans people participating in sport. He is firm in his support, and welcomes trans people competing in sports corresponding to their gender right to the very top level. ""I know what it is like to be on the outside, to not fit in. I know I now have a powerful platform on social media... so it was very important for me to say something like that [his pro-trans tweet],"" he says. ""I'm not just for the gay community, I'm for the trans community, I'm against racism, I'm for everyone, because that [exclusion] is not on. ""It's 2022 and we're still struggling with gay people being accepted in football. It's no different for transgender people for me: if someone is really talented in a sport, it doesn't matter where they come from, we have to be very accepting and inclusive. ""Things like that badge on the sleeve, that helps people who might find themselves isolated from the world and feel like they don't fit in. ""In 10 or 15 years, we won't even need to have this conversation, there could be trans people playing in top leagues around the world ‚Äì that shouldn't be a problem. ""We are all humans on this planet and deserve to be treated equally."" The most discussed topic regarding LGBT people and football has been the Qatar World Cup later this year. Homosexuality is illegal in the state, with punishment of up to three years in prison. Honoured to help stand for change with human rights and equality for my LGBTQ community. Let‚Äôs change the world for the better. https://t.co/NxWaz6gRIp Cavallo has, since coming out, talked to organisers and publicly spoken of the reassurances he has been given regarding the safety of LGBT people travelling to watch, report on or play in the tournament. ""It did concern me, seeing that the World Cup is in a country which does not approve of the LGBT community,"" he says. ""It made me wonder, is my life more important than doing something really good in my football career. ""But the Qatar World Cup community, they have made me very welcome, this is going to be a safe space, you will not be treated any differently. ""I want to keep my message powerful, that I do stand for my LGBT community, and I want the best for everyone. And if I get the chance to represent the Socceroos, I will be there, there is no doubt."" Ending 2022 at a World Cup would conclude an incredible year-long journey for Cavallo, but there is a long way to go before then. He will, as he has done throughout his career and especially since last October, take it in his stride. ""I'm only 22, I'm gonna make mistakes along the way. I'm learning as I go.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/josh-cavallo-death-threats-coming-out-gay/blt7793dddc4b6e56a4,Emma Smith,f12c35ad-2991-4359-8af6-4550672aeffe
Atletico Madrid captain Koke appears to fire back at Man City boss Guardiola over 'prehistory' 5-5-0 formation comment,"Atletico Madrid captain Koke has appeared to fire back at Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola over his ""prehistory"" comment on the Liga giants' 5-5-0 formation in the Champions League. City edged the first leg of their quarter-final tie 1-0 thanks to a 70th-minute strike from Kevin De Bruyne, which came from one of only two shots on target they managed during the contest. Guardiola's side struggled to create many clear-cut chances as Atletico sat back in numbers, and the Spanish head coach vented his frustration after the final whistle. Guardiola defended City's performance and felt they couldn't have done any more to try and break down Diego Simeone's low block at Etihad Stadium. ""He [Simeone] has put [Antoine] Griezmann on the far right and Joao Felix on the far left, and they have gone 5-5-0. Two lines of 5,"" The 51-year-old tactician told reporters. ""In prehistory, today and in a hundred thousand years it is very difficult to attack a 5-5, there are no spaces."" Koke later took to social media to seemingly hit back at Guardiola, posting an image of Atletico's badge on his Instagram story. The post included the message: ""In love with your history since pre-historic times, proud to be Atleti."" Atletico will welcome City to Wanda Metropolitano for the return leg on April 13, where they will be aiming to overturn the 1-0 aggregate deficit. The eventual winners will be rewarded with a semi-final tie against either Chelsea or Real Madrid, who are due to play the first leg of their quarter-final at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/atletico-madrid-captain-koke-fire-back-man-city-guardiola/blt3ebad5e9da3ed88d,James Westwood,1db3d0f8-ac9b-4404-88c0-96ea944cd9d2
Pochettino makes huge claim that Mbappe is staying at PSG to deal transfer blow to Real Madrid,"Mauricio Pochettino has claimed there is a ""100 per cent"" chance that he and Kylian Mbappe will still be at Paris Saint-Germain next season. Mbappe's current contract at PSG is due to expire on June 30 and the club have not yet been able to reach an agreement with the striker over an extension. Real Madrid are reportedly pushing hard to sign Mbappe on a free transfer, but Pochettino has now come out to insist that he will remain at Parc des Princes beyond the summer. The Argentine manager has also rubbished speculation over his own future amid reports PSG are set to sack him after a disappointing 2021-22 campaign that saw a Ligue 1 title triumph do little to detract from an early Champions League exit. Asked how likely it is that PSG will keep him on as head coach and manage to tie Mbappe down to a fresh contract, Pochettino told a press conference on Thursday: ""100 per cent in both cases."" The 50-year-old added on why he is so confident that Mbappe will decide to stay put: ""It's my feeling today, what I perceive today. That's what I can say now.  ""Of course, it's football and you never know what can happen. But when asked on what I think today, that's my answer."" Mbappe pushed for a move to Madrid last year and it was reported that he had verbally agreed to join the Spanish giants upon the expiration of his contract after PSG rejected multiple bids. GOAL has reported that the World Cup winner remains Madrid's number one transfer target, but PSG have stepped up talks to tie him down to fresh terms over the past week. Mbappe met with PSG officials in Qatar and his mother was also present for talks alongside club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. The 23-year-old even publicly indicated he might be leaning towards signing a new contract after starring in a 5-1 win over Lorient at the start of April, as he told reporters: ""Is staying at PSG is possible? Yes of course.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/pochettino-makes-huge-claim-that-mbappe-is-staying-at-psg-to/blt81d3da15b1d1df55,James Westwood,3ae69ebc-db45-4e25-89f4-1c869035dfb0

Lewandowski vs Benzema - How have the star strikers performed for their clubs?,"Robert Lewandowski's move to Barcelona from Bayern Munich is undoubtedly the most talked-about transfer in the ongoing summer window. The Poland international - the incumbent holder of The Best FIFA Men's Player gong - has exited the Bavarian giants after eight years in a ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$50m) move to Camp Nou. With the 33-year-old's switch to La Liga, the Spanish top-flight now boasts two of the best strikers in the world, with Lewandowski set to cross paths with Real Madrid frontman Karim Benzema. It adds another thrilling dimension to El Clasico, the two clubs' regular fixture throughout the campaign, with more than just bragging rights usually on the line for the two heavyweight clubs. The contest has rarely served up anything but thrills and the pair are surely set to add a burst of extra spice and flavour to their encounters this season. But with a pair of lengthy careers in club football across multiple teams and competitions, the duo have racked up their fair share of records and success.

"‚ÄòEven though she takes a bit of energy, she gives me so much‚Äô ‚Äì Juventus star Hurtig ‚Äòsmiling more‚Äô after becoming a mother","Lina Hurtig takes a long pause and looks around the room while she thinks. She is struggling to come up with an answer to the question put to her, until Juventus‚Äô press officer gives her opinion. ‚ÄúI do?‚Äù she asks, responding to the voice off camera. ‚ÄúShe says I‚Äôm smiling more!‚Äù she tells GOAL, turning back towards the computer. There were a lot of big moments for Hurtig in 2021, but none more so than when she became a mother last June. It is that which those around the club can see has her beaming even more so than usual. ‚ÄúRight now, it's not a good time to ask because my daughter is getting her teeth, so we're struggling a bit at home!‚Äù the Swedish forward laughs. ‚ÄúBut no, of course, that was an unbelievable summer. ‚ÄúShe came in June and then I had to leave like four weeks after for the Olympics. That was also a strange situation. Lisa, my wife, she did an amazing job there. She was in Sweden the whole time, so she had a lot of help. Everything went well. ""But it's amazing. Even though she takes a bit of energy sometimes, she also gives me so much. ‚ÄúI said the other day to Lisa, 'I wonder what she will do when she grows up'. I don't know if she wants to play football. I tried to play with her, but she's totally ignoring the ball right now. So, I don't know!‚Äù That is not the only exposure she is getting to the sport that both of her parents love - Lisa having played in Sweden‚Äôs top flight for six years before giving birth last summer. She is already at Juventus‚Äô games in her own little shirt, with Hurtig on the back, watching her mother play some huge matches at the highest level. As far as Hurtig‚Äôs club career goes, the game she will play on Wednesday evening is one of the biggest yet. Juventus will face seven-time European champions Lyon in the Women‚Äôs Champions League quarter-finals, at the Juventus Stadium. It is an opponent many in this team know well, having played the French giants in last season‚Äôs competition. That time around, Lyon were the defending champions, and Juve were still making a name for themselves. That the Italians only lost 3-2 in the first leg was a result that showed their potential. ""Last time we played them, it was a big test for us,‚Äù Hurtig remembers. ‚ÄúThis year, we got through the group stage and we are where we want to be, you know? Out in Europe, competing against the best - that's exactly where we want to be and where we should be. ""I think we are coming into this game with a lot more confidence than last time. Of course, it's still a really good team, though. I think we're more prepared this time."" Juve caused a big upset in the group stages to get to this point, too, beating last season's finalists, Chelsea, to qualification. ‚ÄúWe gained a lot of confidence [from that],‚Äù Hurtig says. ‚ÄúWe know we're a good team and that was like proof to show everybody else also that we are here to compete against the best in Europe. ""I think people were not counting on us being out there in Europe. I think a lot of people have opened their eyes and said, 'Wow, Juventus is here to stay'."" This past year, Juve has developed massively. Under the guidance of former Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro, the team has shown its ability to be tactically flexible and defensively resolute, but also expansive going forward. Each individual is better than the last time they played Lyon, too. Hurtig, for example, has since played at an Olympics for the first time and in an Olympic final. Sweden were beaten by Canada on penalties last summer, but it is an experience that certainly helps a player grow. Hurtig‚Äôs performances in Japan gave her a lot of confidence going into this new season, while the silver medal she collected added to her hunger for trophies. There was a point in the 26-year-old‚Äôs career where some wondered if she would reach this point ‚Äì competing at the highest level, in the biggest games, on a regular basis. The doubt was never around the talent she possessed, but the bad luck she was being dealt so often through injury. It is a journey that makes her proud when she reflects. ‚ÄúThere were a couple of years when I struggled a lot with my foot,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúI trained, I got injured. I trained, I got injured. There was no flow at all. ‚ÄúWhat motivates you is that you want to get back to the pitch. I want to play football. That's what I love to do. That's my job and it's the only thing I know how to do! ‚ÄúIt also makes me wonder sometimes if I didn't have that many injuries, where would I be? ‚ÄúThere was a couple of years I, like, lost. If I look back at it now, I would say I lost a couple of years there, but it got better and now I'm here and only looking forward.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-star-hurtig-smiling-more-after-becoming-mother/blt72d10b10e7426a7b,Ame√© Ruszkai,2e5f1630-4102-4115-8bd2-2f36d13fd16d

The 31-year-old says he hopes to give advice to young players to prevent them from making the mistakes he did in the early stages of his career. Balotelli was a notorious figure as a rising young star due to his frequent issues with coaches and ability to make headlines for his controversial behaviour on and off the field. But the striker hopes to use his experience to help younger players, joking that he could also pursue a career in media. He told DAZN: ""After my career, it would be nice to find talents: talk to them and tell them what I did right and wrong, warn them about experiments.  ""I could save them a lot of trouble, or maybe I'll be a journalist."" Balotelli won three Serie A titles and a Champions League crown with Inter, before going on to win the Premier League and FA Cup with Manchester City. But the Euro 2012 finalist regrets not lifting any silverware with the Italy national team. He last played for the country in 2018 and was absent from the team that conquered Europe last summer, though he was called up for a training camp in January this year.  ""I'm happy with what I've done: at club level, I've won everything,"" he added.  ""I'm missing something at the national team level, but that's the only thing I can really regret. Hopefully It's not too late."" Asked about his recent return to the squad, Balotelli said: ""It was a call-up for an internship, but it was exciting because I didn't expect it. I expected anything but that."" He added: ""The best moment of my career in the national team was the European Championship, without a doubt.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maybe-i-ll-be-a-journalist-balotelli-opens-up-on-future/blte6525e6f6a717b8f,By Peter McVitie,2e033192-bb6a-4f71-8775-6173b578f125
2022 World Cup Qualifiers: 'Senegal must play smart football against Egypt' - Cisse,"Senegal coach Aliou Cisse insists his charges have to play smart football to stand a chance of overcoming Egypt at Cairo International in the first leg of their 2022 World Cup qualification play-off. Friday's match will be a repeat of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final, where the Lions of Teranga needed a penalty shootout to win their maiden continental trophy after playing out a 0-0 draw against the Pharaohs. The former international insists his team has improved since then and will be starting the match on a high to stand a chance of making it to the prestigious global competition. ""We arrived [on Wednesday for the match and]... this confirms that we‚Äôre fully focused and well prepared,"" Cisse told reporters as quoted by Kingfut. ""A month has passed since we played the final of the Africa Cup of Nations and it was enough time to improve some aspects. We strive to give our best and we want to start the game tomorrow in the best way possible to achieve a good result. ""We know that we will play two finals to qualify for the World Cup, and I consider them to be three matches that started [with the] Afcon final because we knew that we would meet again. ""This makes the match more difficult. We must play smart football and avoid making mistakes, and we have to come out with a positive result that will help us in the second leg."" The former defender has further stated his team has no problems in attack despite scoring one goal in the Group stage of Afcon en route to winning the biennial competition. ""We qualified with one goal in the group stage of the Africa Cup of Nations and after that, we were able to score six-seven goals, on the way to the final. We have no problem with our attack, and the players are able to change the course of the match,"" he continued. ""We are still hungry despite winning the final of the Africa Cup of Nations. The fact that we won the final against Egypt doesn‚Äôt mean we have no motives. ""The most difficult thing is to continue winning. The Senegalese players don‚Äôt need more motivation to win. We‚Äôre not satisfied with just the Africa Cup of Nations, which is another final for us."" Cisse then went on to state what he is expecting from his star attacker Sadio Mane: ""I have no relationship with Mane, other than he gives everything to the national team.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifiers-senegal-must-play-smart-football/blt992be62daa0eb3d0,Seth Willis,ef60583f-c799-4046-8d63-acb8891f7aec
"Barcelona's door will always be open to Messi, says Xavi","Barcelona coach Xavi insists that former team-mate Lionel Messi would be welcome back to Camp Nou whenever he wishes.  Messi shocked the world of football when he left Barca after two decades last summer to join Paris Saint-Germain.  The club have struggled without the Argentine, although there have been recent signs under Xavi that they are beginning to turn the corner.  ""[Messi] is the greatest of all time and he will always have the door open for him at Barca,"" Xavi told reporters ahead of Sunday's Clasico against Real Madrid.  ""As long as I am Barca coach, he is welcome any day. I think we owe him a big tribute.  ""I think that as he is under contract with PSG, there is not much we can say. But if he wants to he can come to watch training and speak to the coach. What he has given us is priceless.""  Messi's final season at Barca yielded 38 goals in 45 matches in all competitions, leading the Catalan outfit to victory in the Copa del Rey.  His exit coincided with a dramatic dip in form for the club, who sacked Ronald Koeman from his post in October and replaced the Dutchman with Blaugrana idol Xavi.  The former Spain midfielder took time to adjust to his new post, overseeing elimination from the Champions League.  But he and the club are now finding their groove, winning six of their last seven games to climb into La Liga's Champions League qualification spots and also advance into the quarter finals of the Europa League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-s-door-will-always-be-open-to-messi-says-xavi/blt3d412929ec14e80f,Daniel Edwards,20c7cad7-e156-4674-83e6-d05be286bfbf
"Antony, Gakpo, and Pulisic: Analysing all the strikers linked to Man Utd to replace Ronaldo","Manchester United had months to solidify their attack this summer but are now entering crisis mode after their top targets proved either too costly or unattainable. Cristiano Ronaldo's desire to leave threatens to thin an already fragile front-line, and they are desperate to add reinforcements soon. The club have cast a wide net to identify someone, anyone, who might be able to offer them the cutting edge in the final third that they have lacked. The players on their radar have varied dramatically in age and skill level, and just weeks before the window closes, it remains unclear who they might land. GOAL has thumbed through the statistics of Manchester United's most-linked attacking targets and here are the results.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/strikers-linked-man-utd-replace-ronaldo-morata-pulisic-felix/bltb223fbd5c0f24f1a,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,9783f432-7b91-4c97-abb0-c38b99158d60
PSG willing to sell Neymar if acceptable transfer offer arrives - but Brazilian hesitant to leave,"Paris Saint-Germain are open to selling Neymar during the summer transfer window if an acceptable bid is lodged - but the Brazil international would be hesitant to leave, GOAL understands. The forward arrived at Parc des Princes in a move from Barcelona for a world-record fee in 2018, in what was a serious statement of intent from the Ligue 1 club to cement their position as a European heavyweight. But a failure to reach the ultimate prize - the Champions League - and the decision of Kylian Mbappe to extend his stay with the club following a protracted transfer saga with Real Madrid means the capital team would consider parting ways with the 30-year-old, particularly after a turbulent 2021-22 campaign. Despite reclaiming the Ligue 1 crown under Mauricio Pochettino this term, many deem PSG to have endured an underwhelming campaign given their early Champions League exit to Real Madrid. Neymar received the brunt of criticism from the club's supporters, with him and Lionel Messi both roundly booed in the spring following their European collapse. The Brazilian player's attitude and on-field stagnation have been scrutinised by the club, GOAL understands. Mbappe's decision to remain at PSG may also play into any decision-making process involving Neymar's future, with the France international thought to have some sway in transfer policy and squad matters following his lucrative new deal. Mbappe's relationship with Neymar is said to have cooled in recent years. Despite these matters however, the attacker does not wish to depart Parc des Princes, and otherwise intends to continue with PSG next season. Neymar only penned fresh terms last year, to take him through 2025 at the club, and following a season of teething troubles for several headline stars, there may be a hope that PSG's collective squad of world-class talents can perform much better in 2022-23. With a Qatar 2022 World Cup looming where his Brazil side are widely tipped to be among the favourites, the 30-year-old will have every reason to prove the doubters wrong at PSG - and show why the club paid a king's ransom for him in the first place. If the Brazilian was to depart Parc des Princes, the number of sides who could realistically sign him are limited given the large fee he is likely to command. Though Neymar will likely be sold for an effective fraction of the world-record payout PSG forked out for his services originally, his expected cost will put a host of sides - including former club Barcelona - likely out of the chase. The Blaugrana reportedly held previous informal discussions surround a swap with Ousmane Dembele midway through the 2021-22 campaign, but with the latter primed to exit Camp Nou as a free agent, such a move is no longer relevant. Newcastle could match both transfer and salary demands, but Neymar is not considered interested in joining the Magpies.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-willing-to-sell-neymar-acceptable-transfer-offer/blt77c0544eeef773e3,Marc Mechenoua,79d135f1-6636-4361-8cfd-3b55be1d007e
Dele's career hangs on a knife edge but Alli and Lampard's Everton could be a perfect match,"There is nobody quite like Dele Alli, which it turns out is both a blessing and a curse; the reason the rise was so spectacular and the fall so sudden, the reason his departure from Tottenham Hotspur was necessary and yet hurt supporters deeply. Dele accrued 19, 25, and 19 Premier League goal contributions in successive seasons between 2015 and 2018. In the following three-and-a-half years, he has scored or created 21 in total. It is a remarkable decline.¬† When Dele first broke into the first team in north London, his unique style gave him an edge. There was a rawness to his game, a playfulness, a sense that something unexpected could happen at any moment. He lit up dull matches, confounded opposition expectations, and sprinkled Mauricio Pochettino‚Äôs Spurs with a bit of magic. But it was always difficult to define exactly what Dele did for long periods of matches, when he would disappear from the game only to re-emerge with a deft touch or a clinical finish (even in the 2016-17 season, when he scored 18 goals and Spurs won 86 points, Dele ranked 11th at Spurs for passes made).¬† It was also difficult to grasp what Dele‚Äôs best position was or how he really fit into the system. It is that side of his uniqueness that has led to four years in the wilderness as successive Spurs managers struggled to work out what to do with him. That uncertainty or distrust ‚Äì from Jose Mourinho famously calling him ‚Äúf*cking lazy‚Äù to Nuno Espirito Santo trialling him as a box-to-box midfielder ‚Äì has seen the energy drain out of a man who once played with so much joy. In an interview with Sky Sports on transfer deadline day, Dele was asked what motivated the move to Everton.  Tellingly, and a little heart-breakingly, Dele simply said: ‚ÄúI just want to be happy playing football.‚Äù Delighted to have joined @everton. I can‚Äôt wait to get started. Thank you for such a warm welcome. I‚Äôm counting down the days to see you all at Goodison üíô #UTT pic.twitter.com/F7cxjvPwxs In that respect, he could not have picked a better transfer. Linking up with Frank Lampard is the perfect opportunity to get back to enjoying himself because, whether the new manager is a success or failure at Everton, it will most certainly be an entertaining, attack-minded ride with Dele centre-stage. Lampard‚Äôs Chelsea were pretty chaotic, attacking in a free-form way that seemed to ignore the modern need for detail and structure when in possession. Much like Lampard the player, his teams roamed about individualistically, improvising their attacks by surging forward in high numbers and pressing their nearest man. When confidence was up, the sheer force of Chelsea‚Äôs attacking talent led to high-scoring games and big wins.¬† But for the majority of the time the absence of balanced scaffolding, a tighter positional sense to how Chelsea held the ball, meant it was easy to poke holes in the team on the counterattack. What‚Äôs more, the pressing was so disordered (the forwards might rush at the ball while the midfielders scramble backwards) that opponents were given the freedom of the pitch once they evaded the first wave of pressure.¬† Contemporary Premier League football requires the same things on the ball as off it: pinpoint accuracy in where to stand and when to move, drilled on the training field to create a balanced formation and compression between the lines.¬† ‚úçÔ∏è | Everton Football Club can confirm the appointment of Frank Lampard as the Club‚Äôs new manager. It leaves little room for teams who wander, who dip in and out, and who are allowed to follow their creative instincts. However, unless a new backroom team ‚Äì led by Carlo Ancelotti‚Äôs long-time assistant Paul Clement ‚Äì marks a sudden departure from what we saw at Chelsea, that is exactly what Lampard‚Äôs Everton will do. That is perhaps bad news for the Toffees, a team without the financial and technical insulation of a ‚ÄòBig Six‚Äô club to allow for tactical slack. But it might just be very good news for Dele. The 25-year-old‚Äôs defining trait is his capacity to make unseen runs beyond the centre-forward, playing as a second striker who hovers around the action, ghosting into pockets that are very rarely used in the modern game. In the last few years, Dele has stopped making these runs altogether as he is gradually moulded by successive counterattacking coaches into a deeper midfield player. This plays to none of his strengths. Mourinho and Nuno both deploy low blocks, and from such a conservative starting position Dele does not have the capacity to make late runs into the box or to play those delightful one-touch passes between the lines. He needs a free-flowing buzz of attackers around him to feel at home. Lampard will no doubt provide that for Dele, whose old scoring rate and tendency to pop up in the box aligns neatly with how Lampard saw the game as a player. He will encourage Dele‚Äôs risk-taking and his eye for goal; will encourage pot-shots and runs into the six-yard box. pic.twitter.com/rjUFFJOiT2 What‚Äôs more, Everton will look to deploy a high defensive line that allows Dele to start as a 10, but burst beyond Dominic Calvert-Lewin, in a 4-2-3-1 (a formation Lampard used often at Chelsea and Derby County).¬† In theory, it is a ‚Äúperfect match‚Äù, to use Dele‚Äôs words, and yet it would be naive to assume Lampard‚Äôs attacking tactics alone will help a player so susceptible to the psychological state of the club he is at. Dele‚Äôs problems at Spurs coincided with the downfall of Pochettino and he never recovered. There is a sense that he might be a 'luxury' player, or at least one who struggles for form unless the atmosphere is right. Consequently, should Everton struggle under Lampard, then so too will Dele. After all, the attacking side of the game does not exist in a vacuum.¬† Everton have a very leaky defence and a porous midfield, playing in a hopelessly decompressed system under Rafael Benitez and making countless individual errors.  It is hard to see how Lampard‚Äôs coaching, or lack of it, will work once an initial new-manager bounce wears off, especially as he will require the centre-backs to defend high up the pitch and play out from the back.¬† On a personal level, Dele‚Äôs intelligent pressing and hard work off the ball stand him in good stead, although if he and Donny van der Beek start, then Everton‚Äôs central midfield could be alarmingly light when opposition counterattacks begin. Should Chelsea‚Äôs glaring flaws re-emerge at Everton, they could yet be dragged into a relegation battle, in turn ensuring that Dele once again drifts tentatively on the fringes, lost amid the chaos. That was always going to be the danger of signing such a unique player, someone so charismatic and yet so fragile.¬† Dele‚Äôs career hangs on a knife edge, with as much chance of failure and success.  However, it is hard to think of a better match for his untameable attacking style than Lampard, a manager with no interest in putting a leash on his most creative players.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dele-alli-lampard-everton-perfect-match/blt406aa47aa9d3841d,Alex Keble,00278a63-876c-4c7f-a35e-4075f0fbb9a3
'I was drunk!' - PSG forward Neymar jokes about his goal vs Lorient as he aims dig at journalist,"Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has joked that he was ""drunk"" when scoring his sensational solo goal against Lorient in a clear dig at a French journalist that criticised him last month. PSG edged closer to regaining the Ligue 1 title with a comprehensive 5-1 win over Lorient on Sunday, with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe both netting braces and Lionel Messi completing the scoring. All five of the home side's goals were eye-catching, but Neymar's second stood out most as he ran from inside his own half and played a neat one-two with Mbappe before calmly slotting the ball home. RMC Radio reporter Daniel Riolo made headlines in March for claiming that Neymar ""turns up drunk for training"", which prompted Lyon star Lucas Paqueta to come out and publicly defend his Brazil international team-mate. Neymar couldn't resist getting in his own response after the Lorient game, with the 30-year-old taking to social media to explain how he managed to score his second goal. ‚ÄúI was 'drunk', that's why it worked... as they say around there,"" Neymar wrote as a caption above the goal video on his Instagram stories. Neymar has been subjected to intense scrutiny throughout the 2021-22 campaign, with familiar injury problems once again preventing him from producing his best form on a regular basis. The Brazil international was even booed by fans following PSG's round of 16 Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid, and continues to frustrate with his inconsistency. Neymar's two-goal showing against Lorient served as a reminder of what he is capable of, but he has only managed to find the net seven times in 22 appearances in all competitions, while also adding a modest total of five assists.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/drunk-psg-forward-neymar-jokes-goal-lorient-dig-journalist/blt4d374b135cb59fe0,James Westwood,9ba7190b-a49f-4106-a6bc-6cac0e3b8eaa
Atletico star Lodi joins Nottingham Forest on loan as Premier League new boys secure 18th summer signing,"WHAT HAPPENED? Forest confirmed the season-long loan deal for Lodi via their official website on Monday morning, with the defender having been present to watch their 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham at the weekend. The Brazilian has left the Spanish capital in pursuit of regular game time ahead of the World Cup in Qatar this winter. THE BIGGER PICTURE: Lodi becomes Forest's 18th signing of the summer and they reportedly have the option to buy him outright for ¬£25 million ($29m/‚Ç¨30m).

'It won't be easy' - Inbound Arsenal transfer Fabio Vieira tells fans what to expect as Porto star prepares for Premier League switch,"Fabio Vieira is aware that life in the Premier League ‚Äúwon‚Äôt be easy‚Äù as he prepares to complete a ¬£30 million ($37m) transfer from Porto to Arsenal. The Portuguese midfielder has seen a switch to Emirates Stadium pushed through quickly after emerging as a shock target for the Gunners. He is now readying himself for the toughest of challenges in the English top-flight, as he endeavours to hit the ground running, with the 22-year-old vowing to do all he can to convince Mikel Arteta and a loyal fan base in north London of his worth. The creative playmaker has told The Mirror that he was never pushing for a move during the summer transfer window, but is happy to have been given an opportunity to show Arsenal what he can do. Vieira has said: ‚ÄúI was always happy at Porto but this chance is important for any professional. ‚ÄúPlaying in the Premier League won‚Äôt be easy and I promise only to work, work, work. ‚ÄúMy agent worked on the deal between the two clubs and I accepted the deal because it was important for all parties. I have always watched the Premier League on TV.‚Äù The Gunners had been heavily linked with the likes of Youri Tielemans and Ruben Neves as reinforcements for Arteta‚Äôs engine room were sought, with raids on Leicester and Wolves being speculated on. Vieira is, however, the man that Arsenal have turned to and will be hoping to maintain the standards he has set over recent years at Porto. He contributed 16 assists to that cause last season, along with seven goals, and is capable of operating as ball-playing No.8 or a creative No.10. If no more midfield options are acquired by Arsenal during the current window, then Vieira could slot into Arteta‚Äôs plans alongside the likes of Thomas Partey and Martin Odegaard. He can be eased into the fold during pre-season, with friendly dates being lined up, while a competitive debut could be made when the Gunners open their 2022-23 Premier League campaign away at Crystal Palace on August 5.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/easy-arsenal-transfer-fabio-vieira-tells-fans-porto-premier/blt54c88f589ffd690a,Chris Burton,b0dcc1b8-3586-44a5-8f89-31e3b2f0925c
Spurs star Doherty left rattled by rough boat ride in hilarious video posted by team mate Dier,"Tottenham's finish to the Premier League season was hardly smooth sailing, but it was nothing compared to what defender Matt Doherty went through. The right-back is on holiday after his side secured a top-four finish in the top flight, booking their place in next season's Champions League. Doherty, 30, was not exactly having a relaxing time as he endured a bumpy ride on a boat. In a video uploaded by team-mate Eric Dier, Doherty was getting rattled around as the boat sailed over the rough water. The Ireland international looked nervous as he struggled to stay on his seat while Dier recorded. The Spurs duo are in Monaco this weekend to take in the Formula One Grand Prix. The pair were asked on Sky Sports which racer they were backing to win the event, with Doherty revealing he is a Max Verstappen fan. ""I'm a Max fan, my mum's Dutch so I have to side with him,"" he said. ""I'm half Dutch, so that's why he gets my vote.""  Dier was then involved in a humorous incident as he declared: ""We're with Red Bull so hopefully the Red Bull cars can do a great job and maybe get in front of the Ferraris."" The presenter then revealed that Dier had pledged his support to another racer before the cameras started rolling and pressed him to admit his real choice. ""They'll be upset with me,"" he said, before finally saying: ""Lewis [Hamilton].""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-spurs-doherty-boat-ride-video-dier/blt16f10ff3ba7ad15a,Peter McVitie,2c47f98a-0f90-4da4-afa4-e651afc6d677
Tottenham seal ¬£50m Richarlison transfer as Brazil star completes move from Everton,"Tottenham have completed the signing of Richarlison from Everton, with the Brazil international forward trading one Premier League ever-present for another. It appeared at one stage as though the 25-year-old would be heading to north London as a new addition at Arsenal, but the Gunners have turned their attention to alternative Samba stars such as Gabriel Jesus and Raphinha. That left the door open for Spurs to swoop in, with another proven Premier League performer being added to Antonio Conte‚Äôs ranks on the back of deals for Fraser Forster and Yves Bissouma. Spurs are splashing out an initial ¬£50 million ($61m) fee to get the deal for Richarlison over the line. The agreement reached with the Toffees includes the option for a further ¬£10m ($12m) to be paid in add-ons. It's official üî• #WelcomeRicharlison pic.twitter.com/pC6IOv2kLp The South American star has committed to a five-year contract with Spurs through to the summer of 2027. Personal terms were agreed quickly between all parties, with medical tests the last box that was ticked before the relevant paperwork was signed. Tottenham already boast plenty of firepower in their ranks, with England captain Harry Kane very much a talismanic presence in the final third of the field. They also have Son Heung-min on their books, with the South Korea forward having claimed a share of the Premier League Golden Boot last season. Sweden international Dejan Kulusevski impressed on the back of his loan move from Juventus in January, but questions have been asked of how long Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn will be sticking around. The press. The finish. üëå@richarlison97 üëè#EVECHE pic.twitter.com/H20ueCW3HQ Conte is eager to avoid leaving himself short of options in an important area of the field, with Richarlison being drafted in as another ready-made starter. He has, having first arrived in English football at Watford in 2017, reached double figures when it comes to goals in each of the last four seasons. Richarlison has registered 53 in total for Everton through 152 appearances and has shown that he can be a threat down the middle, out wide, on the floor and in the air. As mentioned, Spurs boast plenty of options when it comes to filling attacking berths. Richarlison has, however, already shown what he is capable of on a Premier League stage and will expect to slot straight into Conte‚Äôs plans. He will operate from out wide, potentially down the right, with prolific striker Kane dropping deep from a central position while Son causes havoc down the left. There will be plenty of space for Richarlison to get in behind, as Kane pulls defenders out of position, and his pace should become another useful asset to the collective cause. After securing qualification for the Champions League with a top-four finish last season, reinforcements were always going to be required at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The club's first signing of the summer came in the form of Ivan Perisic, with the Croatia star familiar with the workings of Conte after their time together at Inter. England international goalkeeper Forster will, with vast experience to call upon, provide welcome competition and cover for club captain Hugo Lloris. Mali international midfielder Bissouma had been courted by a number of leading sides in the Premier League before Spurs swooped in to seal a ¬£25m ($30m) deal to bring him in from Brighton. He is considered to be a serious upgrade in Conte‚Äôs engine room, and there remains the promise of more additions to come. They are not done there, either, as GOAL has been able to confirm that Spurs are looking to raid the ranks of Barcelona and Villarreal for defensive duo Clement Lenglet and Pervis Estupinan, respectively. Another right wing-back also figures prominently on Tottenham‚Äôs wish list, with Middlesbrough-owned Djed Spence ‚Äì who starred on loan at Nottingham Forest last season ‚Äì an option that continues to be explored.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tottenham-50m-richarlison-transfer-everton-forward/blt458d13234e8e84c8,Chris Burton,47e1945a-ba59-43ea-bc39-4d9bab500a6d
Paqueta completes ¬£50m West Ham transfer as Arsenal miss out on Lyon playmaker,"WHAT HAPPENED? The Hammers have won the race for the Brazil international, tying him down to a five-year contract with an additional one-year option. Paqueta, who scored 11 goals and assisted seven last season, had also been strongly linked with Arsenal and Newcastle. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The Hammers won for the first time in the Premier League this season when they took down Aston Villa 1-0 on Sunday. It's been an otherwise tough start to the campaign, though they did qualify for the group stages of the Europa Conference League with a 6-1 aggregate win over Danish side Viborg. David Moyes will hope that Paqueta's arrival at the club will inspire a swift turnaround in domestic fortunes. IN THREE PHOTOS:    THE VERDICT: Paqueta is a regular in the Brazil national team, who are expected to be in the mix to win the 2022 World Cup later this year.

Aguero: I realized something was bad when they left me in a small room alone,"Former Manchester City star Sergio Aguero has opened up on the heart ailment that led to his retirement and the moment he realised the problem was serious. Aguero was suddenly forced to retire in the fall, just months after making the move to Barcelona on a free transfer. And, opening up for the first time since having to end his playing career, Aguero explained how he handled such a scary moment in his life. Aguero was forced to end his playing career prematurely after being diagnosed with a heart issue. He only ended up making five appearances for the club before¬†it ruled him out of action indefinitely. That leave rapidly turned to retirement after Aguero realised the severity of the issue, and he reflected on that decision in his first public comments since announcing his retirement. ""The first 15 days I had a terrible time,"" Aguero said on Twitch. ""When it happened, I thought it was nothing and that I was going to be fine, but when I arrived in the hospital and they left me in a small room alone with a lot of monitors around me, I realized something was bad. And after two days hospitalized, I started to become nervous."" Aguero went on to say that he had a small surgery when doctors put a microchip in his chest to allow them to permanently monitor his heart rate. Aguero's former club Manchester City recently signed another Argentinian attacker, bringing in Alvarez from River Plate. City paid a ¬£14 million ($18m) fee to sign Alvarez, who will remain on loan with River Plate until the summer. ""Julian is so good,"" Aguero said. ""I have a good relationship with him.

"Ted Lasso claims did not sour my Manchester United spell, insists American coach Armas","Chris Armas faced some uncomfortable questions during his time as a member of Ralf Rangnick‚Äôs coaching team at Manchester United, with reports suggesting that he had been nicknamed ‚ÄòTed Lasso‚Äô by unconvinced members of the playing staff, but the American claims to have thoroughly enjoyed his time at Old Trafford.  The 49-year-old had never worked outside of the United States prior to linking up with the Premier League heavyweights after the German tactician inherited the managerial reins on an interim basis. A lack of experience was said to have attracted some attention on the training ground, leading to comparisons being made with the fictional character from the popular series on Apple TV+, but Armas says he had the full support of everyone he met during his stint in England. Armas told The Crack Podcast: ‚ÄúIt didn't affect anything you were seeing but when Erik ten Hag comes in with full support, going to be here for three years, all of a sudden he's bringing in one, two, three four players. You'll see by the time the season starts it might be eight new faces. ‚ÄúOut with some guys, in with some freshness, hunger, a real specific style of play they can implement. It's night and day what Rangnick can do. Ralf came in and had ideas of what he wanted to do. ‚ÄúWere they really going to push for Ralf to hit a home run, I don't know, they didn't add one player. So that's not me talking bad about the club, the club didn't add one single player in the transfer window when we're right in fourth position. ‚ÄúWhy not? I don't know. Imagine, it's a blessing and curse, for me, I'm only grateful, they treated me, I promise you all, tremendously. Upper management, coaching staff, Darren Fletcher, they treated me as if I'd been there forever and they were amazing. ‚ÄúWith the players, I had a really good rapport, top to bottom, young or older, or superstar. The frustrating thing is you find yourself with this gift, like a pot of gold and I can't carry it, it's too heavy.‚Äù Armas was among those moved on by United as they look to move in a different direction under the tutelage of former Ajax boss Ten Hag. Rangnick, who was due to move into a consultancy role once his job in the dugout came to a close, has also severed tied with the Premier League giants as he now oversees matters with the Austria national team. He has drafted in Lars Kornetka, Peter Perchtold and Onur Cinel alongside him as assistants, but Armas is currently out of work.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ted-lasso-manchester-united-coach-armas/bltd9b72719ed05f66d,Chris Burton,3ff8b8dc-ef4e-4a99-a3bc-c40b25b41c51

Van der Sar responds to transfer rumours linking Man Utd keeper Henderson with Ajax loan move,"Ajax CEO Edwin van der Sar has responded to rumours linking Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson with a move to the Eredivisie club. Henderson came through the ranks at United and was sent out on loan several times before finally breaking into the starting XI last season. However, he has fallen back behind David de Gea in the Old Trafford pecking order in recent months, leading to fresh question marks over his future. It has been reported that Ajax will offer Henderson a way out of Manchester when the winter transfer window opens. The Dutch giants have been tipped to try and sign the 24-year-old on an initial loan deal with Andre Onana currently serving a doping ban and Maarten Stekelenburg sidelined through long-term injury. However, former United keeper Van der Sar has now come out to set the record straight, telling Voetbal Primeur: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard nowadays you can pay ‚Ç¨2,000 a month and hire media agencies to throw out nice stories about players into the world. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about social media, so to speak. You are continuously linked to players, whether they come from South America or Eastern Europe. But no, this makes no sense."" Henderson returned to Old Trafford after a two-year loan at Sheffield United in the summer of 2020 with a view to finally wrestling the number one spot away from De Gea. He made 26 appearances across all competitions for United last term, recording 13 clean sheets, and also managed to earn a place in England's national team set-up. However, a hip injury halted his momentum in June and De Gea has capitalised to win back the first-choice role between the sticks on a permanent basis. Henderson still has four years left on his contract, but after making just two appearances for the Red Devils at the start of 2021-22 it has been suggested that he is eager to leave in search of regular minutes, with Newcastle also reportedly interested in his services.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/van-der-sar-transfer-rumours-man-utd-henderson-ajax-loan/blt34527bb38b567aca,James Westwood,c5b54815-5da9-4d89-bdf8-754163f36477
Ferdinand calls out Rashford as Man Utd forward told his 'body language is an issue',"Marcus Rashford has been warned that his ‚Äúbody language is an issue‚Äù after failing to make the desired impact for Manchester United in their 1-0 defeat to Wolves, with Rio Ferdinand questioning the collective attitude of those at Ralf Rangnick‚Äôs disposal. The Red Devils stumbled out of the blocks in 2022 when going down to a late Joao Moutinho goal at Old Trafford, with the club‚Äôs interim manager suffering a first defeat in his tenure. England international Rashford was among those introduced off the bench as second-half inspiration was sought, but he suffered similar passing struggles to many of his team-mates and offered little to suggest that he should be handed a starting berth in United‚Äôs next outing. Former Red Devils defender Ferdinand was among the spectators to be left unimpressed by United‚Äôs efforts against Wolves and has told Vibe With Five: ‚ÄúBody language is an issue. ‚ÄúMarcus Rashford comes off the bench and you are expecting him to go out there and really fly and give it some. And sometimes you see him losing the ball and the reaction to losing the ball isn‚Äôt what you want to see. ‚ÄúThat could be down to him not being happy not playing etc. But you‚Äôve got to put that to one side. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre out of the team it‚Äôs about coming in and proving to the manager what you‚Äôre about and who you are. Maybe he feels he is not getting the opportunities he deserves. I don‚Äôt know. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to pinpoint one player ‚Äì you can‚Äôt, all the players have to take responsibility from Cristiano [Ronaldo] at the top all the way down to all the other players.‚Äù Rashford was not the first player to be introduced by Rangnick against Wolves, with Bruno Fernandes sent on in place of Mason Greenwood on the hour mark. That change did not go down well with a disgruntled home support, as boos rang out when No.11 flashed up on the fourth official‚Äôs board, but United‚Äôs German coach has sought to defend his decision. Rangnick said of taking Greenwood off when the 20-year-old had been one of the Red Devils‚Äô brighter sparks: ‚ÄúThe question was shall I take off Mason or shall I take off Edi [Cavani]. ‚ÄúWe decided to keep Edi as the most offensive, the more 'striker' of the two of them and take off Mason. ‚ÄúIt was my call. We could have done it in another way but we chose Mason. We know how the fans like Mason but, until then his effort, and performance was not outstanding but at least he was one of the better players.‚Äù Rangnick added when speaking to Sky Sports: ‚ÄúIt was 0-0 and we had our better moments in that part of the game, so we decided to bring on Bruno. He had a big chance to put us 1-0 ahead. ‚ÄúMason was good but I had to take somebody off and I didn't want to take one of the no.6s off [Scott McTominay or Nemanja Matic] so the question was should I take off Edi or Mason, and I decided to take off Mason.‚Äù United will be back in action on January 10 when they open their FA Cup campaign for 2021-22 with a third-round clash against Premier League rivals Aston Villa.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/body-language-issue-rashford-attitude-questioned-man-utd/bltee33afdaf1401ce1,Chris Burton,b2366f37-0d7f-4e3a-999e-e295280738b5
Klopp wants points if Man Utd protest forces postponement of Liverpool's trip to Old Trafford,"Jurgen Klopp believes Liverpool should be given the points should their clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford be postponed by protests from fans. According to social media activity, fans of the Red Devils are planning fresh protests against the ongoing Glazer ownership of the club, which has recently been thrown into doubt after British Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe announced that he plans on bidding for the club. The fixture on August 22 is set be the stage for a mass walkout by fans as they try and capitalise on developments in recent days. In May 2021, fans stormed the stadium, gaining access to the Old Trafford pitch and attempted to enter the changing rooms in protest of the Glazer's role in the formation of the failed European Super League. Liverpool eventually won the fixture 4-2, helping them secure Champions League football the following season. Speaking in a press-conference, Klopp said: ""I really hope it will not happen, but if it happens, I think we should get the points. ""We have nothing to do with the situation. If that happens and the supporters want the game to be not happening then we can't just rearrange the game then fit it in somewhere in anyway in an incredibly busy schedule.  ""I don't think and I really hope this will not happen. I have no idea what could happen, I don't think about it. People tell us we are fine so we go there and play the game, hopefully, and go home. In a situation like this always the other team should get the points because they have nothing to do with it.""

"FC Cincinnati vs Orlando City: Predictions, tips & betting odds","Orlando City have the chance to move to the top of MLS' Western Conference when they visit FC Cincinnati in the early hours of Saturday morning. The Florida outfit are currently fourth but victory in Ohio would move them a point clear of current leaders New York FC. The hosts, meanwhile, are sitting in eighth place but a win would move them firmly into the playoff positions. Cincinnati have been in poor form in front of their own fans and their run of just two wins in 13 home league matches stretches back to September last year. Pat Noonan's men are available at 6/5 (2.20) with bet365 to pick up all three points, while the visitors are offered at 11/5 (3.20) and the draw at 5/2 (3.50). Orlando have lost just once on the road this season and have never lost in Cincinnati. The hosts boast one of the top scorers in MLS this season with Brandon Vazquez having netted eight times this season, already doubling his total from the entire of the previous campaign. The 23-year-old striker is available at 11/2 (6.50) to break the deadlock with Brazilian forward Brenner the favourite at 5/1 (6.00) despite not scoring yet this term. The visitors' top scorer this year is Austrian international Ercan Kara with six strikes and he is available at 11/2 (6.50) to net first, while former Milan star Alexandre Pato can be backed at 7/1 (8.00). Cincinnati have been consistent scorers this year netting in 13 of their 15 league clashes yet their defensive record is the third worst in the division having conceded 26 times. Matches involving the Ohio side have been entertaining encounters, with their last five competitive fixtures producing 23 goals and another open game looks likely this weekend. Orlando are on a nine-match scoring run in all competitions and on the road in MLS they have netted in 14 of their last 15 games, which makes backing a high-scoring clash at the TQL stadium look highly appealing. Both teams to score is priced at 4/6 (1.65) but combining this selection with over 2.5 goals sees the odds rise to 21/20 (2.05) which looks like an appealing option. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.    Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals at 21/20 (2.05) for a 2pt stake with bet365 ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fc-cincinnati-vs-orlando-city-predictions-tips-and-betting/blt93b2ea0b46acd441,Phil Kitromilides,2e29c8bb-6f3f-4455-bab8-9c7b6347ebf0
Aguero: I don't watch football anymore ‚Äì it scares me,"Former Manchester City star Sergio Aguero has admitted he wants to watch and play football but he's too scared following his cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis. The former striker was forced into retiring from football on the back of medical advice from his doctors, much to the dismay of fans worldwide. The Argentine has insisted now is the time to relax, though he will begin to consider what kind of role he could still play in football in the future. According to TYC Sports, Aguero said: ""Today I want to play, but I'm scared. I trained all my life to the maximum and in big competitions. I don't watch football or the news, I don't care what's going on.  ""I concentrate on what I like the most, like friends. Returning to play comes into my head from time to time but I know it's something I can't do. They told me I was lucky because I could easily have had a heart attack. Now it time to relax. I'm happy with what I'm doing. On his role with Argentina for the 2022 World Cup: ""We're still talking about what role I'll have. [Argentine FA president Claudio Tapia] has always been nice to me and asked me to come.  ""We're going to chat a little more to see if I'll go to the World Cup draw. I'll be there with the guys, I get along very well with them. I'll be there with them and helping them with tense situations."" At the end of October in 2021, Aguero was told his chest discomfort was due to cardiac arrhythmia and he was subsequently ruled out of action for three months. Cardiac arrhythmia is when the heart beats irregularly, either too slowly or too quickly, but at the time no one necessarily thought the prolific goalscorer would have to hang up his boots. Just one month later in December 2021, Aguero announced to the world he would have to retire on the back of the medical advice he received and thanked all the teams he ever played for in his career.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aguero-i-dont-watch-football-anymore-it-scares-me/blt8aaea61e7bf25a3b,Marwan Harraz,919cee56-3bd4-4c1c-887c-2fe2ed8efa9a
FA Cup 2021-22: Why are there no replays in fourth round & will they be brought back?,"The FA Cup is England's oldest domestic cup competition, known for potential ""giant-killings"" in which lower-league ""minnows"" take on the ""giants"" of the Premier League. The nature of the knockout competition only intensifies the format of the tournament, and though replays in the third and fourth round were a staple, they have been scrapped for this season. GOAL has what you need to know about why FA Cup replays have been abandoned for this season and whether or not they could make a return. Replays will not be played in the FA Cup in 2021-22, as was tradition. Instead of replays, extra-time and, if necessary, a penalty shoot-out will be played to determine which team will progress to the next round. The FA announced in December 2021 that they would be scrapping replays in the third and fourth round, in order to avoid fixture congestion in an already busy English football schedule. The decision was made by the FA amid the growing concern of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, which has caused major disruption to football schedules in Europe and beyond. Several Premier League games had been postponed and called off due to Covid-19 outbreaks within clubs, with the rearranged dates already putting further strain on fixture schedules. The FA said in a statement: ‚ÄúThis exceptional decision was approved by the FA Board on Friday 17 December and has been taken in the wider interest of English football to alleviate the possibility of fixture congestion, following several postponements in recent days and continued uncertainty ahead due to Covid-19. ‚ÄúTies in the third and fourth rounds of this season‚Äôs competition will be played to a finish on the day, with extra-time and penalty shootouts if required.‚Äù The FA plan to re-introduce replays in the third and fourth round next season, stating that these circumstances are temporary. They stated: ""Replays will return up to and including the fourth round of the Emirates FA Cup from the 2022-23 season onwards."" FA Cup replays have been a growing source of controversy from even before Covid-19, with managers having complained about the added physical demands required of players by having to play yet another match during the busiest period of the season. The Carabao Cup scrapped extra-time starting in 2018-19 for all rounds (minus the final), with level ties going straight into penalty-shootout, but it is unknown if the FA Cup would follow.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fa-cup-2021-22-why-are-there-no-replays-in-fourth-round-and-will-/blt258663d7cafe0f87,Cady Siregar,a2b71d91-a9bc-4e9d-a6e0-4f3d4a11e300
Mane slammed by Owen for his actions in Liverpool's win over Everton in Merseyside Derby,"Former England striker Michael Owen has hit out at Liverpool winger Sadio Mane's conduct in the club's 2-0 win over Everton in the Premier League at Anfield on Sunday. Andy Robertson and Divock Origi scored the goals in the second half to ensure the Reds maintained the one-point gap between them and leaders Manchester City. However, Mane was on the ugly side of the win as he stuck his finger into Mason Holgate's face before raising his arm against Allan.  Owen insists the Senegal international's behaviour was not good and he might have even been sent off. ""This is not good, sticking his finger into Holdgate‚Äôs face is something you aren‚Äôt allowed to do,"" Owen told Premier League Productions. ""But then he quickly follows it up by raising his arm again and pushing Allan in the face. So, he got a yellow card for one of those two altercations. I think it was the one on Allan. ""You can‚Äôt raise your hands and you can‚Äôt put it in people‚Äôs faces. I think he also has to be thankful that the two Everton players didn‚Äôt make a meal of it. ""If any of those players go down and start rolling around, then the referee could then get to VAR‚Ä¶ and then you are really risking a red card. He needs to be careful in the future."" Sunday's win for Liverpool was their 12th straight victory at Anfield, and a massive boost ahead of the first leg of their Uefa Champions League semi-final against Spanish outfit Villarreal. The Reds eliminated Benfica in the quarters to seal progression while Villarreal got past Bayern Munich. For Everton, the loss put them in the 18th position with 29 points, two below Burnley but with a game in hand.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mane-slammed-by-owen-for-liverpool-everton-merseyside-derby/bltd59fc5b5df9f6761,Seth Willis,a457cb8c-149c-4284-bd58-9874c97ab86d
Five-a-side row shows why FA policy for transgender players is no longer fit for purpose,"A recent row over whether trans and non-binary players were welcome in an ""LGBT inclusive"" five-a-side league has thrown the spotlight on the Football Association's policies when it comes to transgender footballers ‚Äì and how they are, in 2022, simply not fit for purpose. The FA has an existing trans inclusion policy that is only applicable to participation in domestic football and competitions that are governed by the organisation, and so is the rule for professional and semi-pro leagues in England. It operates on a case-by-case basis and asks trans applicants to meet hormone-based requirements and provide additional evidence of their transition. ""If these requirements are met,"" the document says, ""the FA will only refuse an application if it decides in its absolute discretion that it is necessary... to ensure the applicant's and fellow players' safety and/or fair competition."" The problem with this trans inclusion policy is that the world has moved on since it was put in place in 2015, after a review that began three years previously. For example, there is no mention of 'non-binary' identities, with references only to male or female players. In 2016, the FA did produce 'A Guide to Including Trans People In Football' in conjunction with the charity Gendered Intelligence. This document says trans players who ""fall outside of the description [of man or woman] will be considered case-by-case, taking safety and fair play into account"". However, this is, as the name suggests, only a guide ‚Äì it is not official policy written into law. In the guide, the FA describes a non-binary person as ""someone who does not subscribe to the customary binary approach to gender, and who may regard themselves as neither male nor female, or both male and female, or take another approach to gender entirely."" The 2015 policy is now being reviewed, although Edleen John, the governing body's equality, inclusion and diversity director, exclusively told GOAL last year that the timeframe and process for this had ""not been mapped out yet"". She said: ""We'll be working with our colleagues in governance, in the medical team and our research team, and we will have partnerships with organisations like Gendered Intelligence, so it will be broad in how we gather our information and form our policy. ""It is fair to say when applying our policy from 2015, it has been a successful application of case-by-case basis, which helps the FA remain fully sensitive to the needs of transgender participants, and that will be critical to bear in mind. ""In our review we will look at our policy and decide, is that the right approach? Does that still work, is it still relevant?"" The 2015 policy was implemented by the FA without direct input from organisations which work with LGBT+ people ‚Äì an issue which thankfully they seem to have avoided this time around. Gendered Intelligence, a charity working to improve the lives of trans and non-binary people in the UK, told PinkNews earlier this month: ‚ÄúWe were not involved in setting the FA‚Äôs 2015 trans policy. This policy had already been developed when we were invited to provide supporting guidance. ‚ÄúAlthough we could not influence the terms of the original policy, we have continued to work with the FA in the interests of trans inclusion in sport and physical activity. ""The FA has been in initial contact regarding a refresh of their existing policy, and we are keen to support them and any other national governing bodies on their journey towards inclusivity and equity in sport."" We are proud to have taken part in today‚Äôs #Pride celebrations in London! pic.twitter.com/1v3ZEnBKnD While there is still no timeframe for the FA's trans player policies to be updated, and they are running out of weeks to get it published this season, there does seem to be a desire to provide clarity and updated guidance at professional and semi-pro levels. However, what about where the overwhelming majority of trans and non-binary footballers play the game ‚Äì at amateur level? English amateur football's attitudes towards gender non-conforming players was thrust into focus this LGBT+ History Month when an award-winning five-a-side league, which promoted itself as an LGBTQ+-inclusive competition, was suspended and the owners forced to apologise after several clubs withdrew over ""archaic transphobic rules"". According to a statement from Camden Bells, one of the teams involved in the Super5League in London, a league official told the team that the player ‚Äì who is trans non-binary ‚Äì should not be allowed to play in a ""women's league"". Speaking exclusively to GOAL, Camden Bells founder Hannah Thornley said: ""The rules they have involve invasive tests in order for trans people to play, and if any of our team are not made to feel welcome, we are not going to play. ""I am tired of the way organisations use LGBT labels to entice people and gain from sponsors, but then don't wholly protect us."" Camden Bells have now sent an open letter, signed by several amateur clubs, to FA chief executive Mark Bullingham, asking for regulations to be changed immediately to stop ""invasive"" medical testing and ""transphobic"" practices. The Super5League said it adhered to the FA's rules on transgender players ‚Äì which would mean that any trans person who wanted to take part in a five-a-side kick-about with their mates would have to submit to blood tests, medical checks and invasive background questioning before stepping onto the pitch. For some in the grassroots game, this is not good enough. In 2021, Manchester Laces, a club for women and non-binary people, began a campaign arguing that amateur players who are trans should not have to submit the regular hormone readings required of pro and semi-pro players in order to access the game they love. Laces founder Helen Hardy told Sky Sports: ""We just wanted to open our doors and welcome in everyone. ""We're not expecting to look at your driving licence, birth certificate, or passport. It just comes down to the fact that we're amateur footballers, wanting to play and be part of a community. ""The FA policy is really outdated. It doesn't take into account that as women, we have the right to make decisions for ourselves and we don't need to be pandered to and wrapped in cotton wool."" This is echoed by non-binary players. Lui Asquith, who plays in the Super 5 League, told PinkNews: ‚ÄúThe rules surrounding grassroots football are draconian and over the top. ‚ÄúNo one should be prevented from playing the game they love because they‚Äôre trans, including non-binary. ""The current FA policy insists on gender policing and bodily invasion, which is cruel and should not be entertained. ‚ÄúFootball is for everyone and a biological essentialist attitude to inclusion hurts everyone, not just trans people. ""Every player is impacted and we must not allow for the game we love to be interfered with. ""I can only play if all my team-mates can play without fear of being singled out. We are a team and football is a community for everyone. Anything else isn‚Äôt good enough.‚Äù For amateur football in the UK, there is no obligation to adhere to the FA's trans policy, with most players at this level simply looking for an inclusive space for a fun game with their mates. Looking for a friendly and supportive environment to play football? Look no further. We have sessions for complete beginners, people wanting to get back into football and ballers looking to play for a team challenging to win the league üèÜhttps://t.co/U1TrEbbFqM pic.twitter.com/aIJCBL6iEW The Amateur Football Alliance (AFA) has floated another solution: mixed football. The AFA released a statement about the Super5League incident which said it ""was disappointed and concerned to be informed of an alleged transphobic incident involving one of our clubs and leagues last week."" It also said: ""The Amateur FA has a few leagues participating in The FA‚Äôs mixed football pilot, seeking to prove the hypothesis that mixed football within adult recreational environments does not pose a disproportionate injury risk. ""The FA‚Äôs Football Development Committee are keen to reach a conclusion to the study this season. ""The Amateur FA are hopeful that a rule change will be in place for the start of the 2022-23 season, permitting mixed adult recreational affiliated football."" Mixed football leagues do exist in the UK, such as the Gay Football Supporters' Network (GFSN) League, which has provided many LGBT players with a home in football they have been unable to find elsewhere, with club such as Mersey Marauders taking part. However, this is far from an ideal solution. Mixed football leagues in the UK are very rare ‚Äì the GFSN, for example, has only 13 teams spread all over the country in its two league divisions for 2021-22. Without huge expansion and investment, this would look to be a non-starter.

"World Cup: Ghana set for mini-tournament with Japan, Chile and Tunisia as part of preparations","Ghana have announced friendly fixtures against Japan and either Tunisia or Chile as part of preparations for the World Cup in Qatar later this year. All four nations have qualified for the global showpiece scheduled to run from November 21 to December 18. In what will be a four-nation Kirin Super Cup between June 10 and 14, Ghana, according to a publication on the FA's official website, will lock horns with hosts Japan on June 10, while Tunisia take on Chile. The two winners will come face to face in the final on June 14, the same day the two semi-final losers play each other for bronze. Ghana are looking to use the mini-tournament to enhance their preparations for the World Cup where they have been pitted against Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs Portugal, Luis Suarez‚Äôs Uruguay and Son Heung-Min‚Äôs South Korea. The Japan tournament is expected to complete the Black Stars‚Äô round of assignments in the May 30 to June 14 international window which will also see Otto Addo‚Äôs side take on Madagascar and the Central African Republic in a 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying fixtures. The two Afcon qualifiers are expected to place before the Black Stars, who endured a disappointing outing at Afcon earlier this year but promptly picked themselves back up to beat Nigeria on the away goals rule to qualify for the World Cup, turn attention to Japan for the cup competition. ‚ÄúThe spirit around the team has now changed and I believe that given the draw that we had, our team will be very competitive. Obviously, there are setting decisions that we need to make to set the ball rolling but Portugal ‚Äì yes, Uruguay ‚Äì yes, and Korea Republic, we will make it,"" Ghana FA boss Kurt Okraku said on the Black Stars after the World Cup draw earlier this month. ‚ÄúPreparations for this adventure started at the Afcon. We picked up the pieces, we engaged in those two very big games. ‚ÄúSo beyond that, I am sure we will regroup, I believe we are very sure as to how the team will look like.

2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Mali‚Äôs Traore assures 'We have means and will' to see off Tunisia,"Mali captain Hamari Traore has assured the nation that they have the means to beat Tunisia and qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Mali lost the first-leg encounter 1-0 in Bamako on Friday and face a rather big challenge to beat the Carthage Eagles on their own turf and book the World Cup ticket. ""We have the means and the will to do it, to succeed in this historic qualification,"" Traore told CafOnline. ""The players got their jerseys wet. We weren't able to take advantage of our highlights. ""I'm going to take this opportunity to congratulate the public who came out en masse, it's just a false start and I hope the public will continue to support us. On his part, Tunisia head coach Jalel Kadri has urged his players to forget their away victory and concentrate on fighting for a win at home. ""At this level, it is the Tunisian experience in this kind of competition that made the difference, and this experience requires us to maintain the same state of mind during the return leg,"" Kadri said. ""Nothing is decided yet. We will remain very calm, very focused because it will be another match, even if we have a slight advantage. ""This victory will not matter if we do not confirm it in the return leg. We know that it will be even more difficult and that is why we will forget this victory on the way."" Revisiting their win against the West Africans, Kadri stated what they must do on Tuesday in order to confirm their place in the global competition. ""Mali have great players and, despite playing in numerical inferiority, it posed problems and that is why we must remain vigilant,"" the tactician added. ""We won this match in Bamako thanks to our capital experience and tactical maturity. ""Despite the quality of the Malian players, the Tunisian players took advantage of their awareness of tactics and their experience in this kind of competition.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifiers-mali-s-traore-assures-we-have/blt7dac6a78c41ef126,Kiplagat Sang,6cc7ccf7-2838-462d-9bac-ec754f07c212
"Lisandro Martinez, Fabio Cannavaro & the best 13 centre-backs under 6ft","Lisandro Martinez has become another big-money signing at Manchester United, with the Red Devils investing ¬£46.5 million ($56m) worth of faith in the Argentina international. He arrives at Old Trafford with plenty of pedigree, having won Eredivisie titles with Ajax and the Copa America with his country, but questions are being asked of his suitability to life in the Premier League. That is because the South American stands at just 5ft 9in tall ‚Äì relatively short for a centre-half readying himself for the physical demands of English football ‚Äì but he is in illustrious company when it comes to breaking the mould for players in his position. Among the others to have bucked a trend there are World Cup winners from Spain, Italy, Germany and England, while iconic figures from Barcelona, AC Milan and Inter have also shown that size can be irrelevant when ability takes over. Here, GOAL takes a look at 13 of the best centre-halves under six foot.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/lisandro-martinez-fabio-cannavaro-best-13-centre-backs-under/blt206ef91b81c53284,Chris Burton,1e9553c1-5a2c-4926-988b-fa9f30351a78
Marcos Senesi: The Feyenoord centre-back both Argentina and Italy wanted,"Marcos Senesi found himself in a very rare position ahead of Wednesday's 'Finalisima' between Argentina and Italy: both sides wanted him to play for them at Wembley. The uncapped Feyenoord defender was not only included in Lionel Scaloni's squad for the match between the champions of South American and Europe. He was also approached by Italy boss Roberto Mancini about becoming the nation's latest Oriundi, following in the footsteps of the likes of Omar Sivori, Humberto Maschio and, more recently, 2006 World Cup winner Mauro Camoranesi in choosing to represent the Azzurri over his country of birth. To Argentina's relief, however, Senesi picked the 'Scaloneta'. The decision was perhaps made easier by the fact that while the Albiceleste are on a high after winning last year's Copa America and qualifying with ease for Qatar 2022, setting a new team record for unbeaten games in the process, Italy are still coming to terms with their failure to qualify for a second consecutive World Cup.  Senesi, though, insists that his loyalty to his homeland was never in doubt. ‚ÄúIt's really great for two national teams to want you, I'm delighted because it means I'm doing well,‚Äù the 25-year-old, who holds an Italian passport through his family ties to the country, explained to Ole. ‚ÄúThe Italy thing was real. I was in contact with Mancini, who told me about his project. ""But I also spoke with the Argentina coaching team and, in that talk, I let them know how much I wanted to play for my country. The decision is absolutely final. ‚ÄúWhen I got the calls, I sat down with my family and listened to them, but the reality is that I have always dreamed about playing with Argentina, since I was a kid.  ""For the last year I have been going to bed thinking about getting my chance.‚Äù It is not hard to see why both Mancini and Scaloni were in the hunt for the centre-back. A graduate of San Lorenzo's academy, whom he joined at the age of 12, moving down from his hometown of Concordia, Senesi made his first-team debut in 2016 and quickly established himself in the Buenos Aires side's starting XI. Three years later, Feyenoord signed him for ‚Ç¨7 million (¬£6m/$7.5m) and the Eredivisie has proven extremely beneficial to Senesi's development, just as it has for fellow defenders Nicolas Tagliafico and Lisandro Martinez, the Ajax duo who have also broken into the Argentina squad on the back of their performances in Netherlands. Calls for Senesi to join his compatriots in the national team had been building anyway, as he slotted effortlessly into Feyenoord's back-line, but they reached a crescendo in 2021-22 due to his consistently strong performances. He missed just two of the club's 34 league games as they secured a Europa League spot next season via a third-placed finish, while with just 34 goals conceded, Feyenoord's defence was the second-best in the division behind Ajax. It was the new UEFA Conference League, though, which gave Senesi his biggest chance to shine, as Feyenoord battled their way all through to the final, where they were narrowly and unluckily beaten 1-0 by Roma.  The Argentine had, coincidentally, been linked with Jose Mourinho's side the previous summer as a possible replacement for the injured Chris Smalling and is bound to attract even more interest after Wednesday's clash at Wembley, with Sevilla, Napoli and new Serie A champions already listed as potential suitors this summer. Senesi joins up with a settled Argentina team in high spirits and led both on and off the field by Lionel Messi, who is preparing for the first steps of a six-month final sprint that will culminate in what will most likely be his final crack at World Cup glory later this year. If there is one concern hanging over this well-oiled Albiceleste machine, as Kylian Mbappe rather clumsily expressed recently, it is that they have had few tests against top European opposition, as the pandemic and changes to the UEFA calendar practically eliminated friendly matches between the two continents these past two years. A clash with Germany back in 2019 was the last time Argentina took on one of their rivals from across the Atlantic Ocean.  Italy may have missed out on the World Cup due to a shock defeat to North Macedonia, but they remain European champions and will be a valuable benchmark with regards to just how far this team has progressed since their shambolic campaign at Russia 2018 under Scaloni's predecessor Jorge Sampaoli. For players like Senesi, meanwhile, this match represents a golden chance to show the Argentina squad what he is capable of. Cristian Romero and Nicolas Otamendi remain the nation's first-choice defensive duo, followed by the likes of German Pezzella, Lisandro Martinez and Lucas Martinez Quarta. But there is still plenty of time for a new face to push itself into contention from here until the action kicks off in November.  And if the Feyenoord man can bring his club form over to the national team, Scaloni will have a hard time indeed ignoring his claim for a seat on the plane to Qatar.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/marcos-senesi-feyenoord-centre-back-argentina-italy-wanted/blt58358518f4a0df71,Daniel Edwards,ac747ecb-7862-4eb3-9a70-f27f2a79bcec
Why is Salah on the bench for Liverpool against Arsenal?,"Liverpool star Mohamed Salah is on the bench against Arsenal on Wednesday. In his place, Diogo Jota, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz have drawn the start. Jurgen Klopp has explained the decision as related to Salah's foot injury recovery, as the player was limited in training this week. ""[Salah] made it, but he just had one training session,"" Klopp said. ""He can come on [as a substitute] really good."" ""We have the opportunity to [make changes]. Naby Keita is in a really good moment but we have the opportunity to make these changes so we need to use the boys when they are ready. Thiago is ready. I thought it would be the right one for today."" Arsenal Mikel Arteta didn't think Salah being on the bench mattered to his plans. ""With the players they have they can play in different formations and ways so I don't think that will make a difference,"" he said. Salah was substituted shortly after scoring the Reds‚Äô second goal at the Amex Stadium, with Jurgen Klopp confirming afterwards that the 29-year-old had ‚Äúoverstretched his foot‚Äù. Klopp also complained of how often Salah is fouled without referees blowing the whistle. ""It is absolutely crazy how low the number of fouls is against him, which the referee doesn't whistle,"" Klopp said. ""So he has constant contact [from defenders] and is going down all the time, having to get up again, stuff like this.‚Äù Salah was last used as a substitute on February 10 against Leicester City, when he played 31 minutes off the bench shortly after returning from Africa Cup of Nations duty.

Tuchel and Conte charged by FA following full-time scrap at Stamford Bridge,"Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte have been charged by the FA after coming to blows following Tottenham's last-gasp draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Both coaches received a red card for their heated confrontation while performing the traditional post-match handshake.  Earlier in the game, Tuchel had reacted angrily when Conte celebrated Spurs' first equaliser in front of the Chelsea bench.  The German would later do the same, racing down the touchline after Reece James had made it 2-1 and seemingly secured all three points for the hosts. However, a 96th minute header from Harry Kane ensured that the spoils were shared.  ""Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte have both been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3, following the Premier League fixture between Chelsea FC and Tottenham Hotspur FC on Sunday 14 August 2022,"" wrote the FA in a statement. ""It is alleged that the behaviour of both managers was improper following the end of the fixture. Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte have until Thursday 18 August 2022 to provide their respective responses."" FA Rule E3 breaches relate to individuals bringing the game into disrepute. It also covers post-match media comments that imply bias and/or attack the integrity of the match officials.  Tuchel revealed after the game that he had been frustrated by several decision made by referee Anthony Taylor and Mike Dean, who was heading up VAR.  The Chelsea boss believed that Kai Havertz was fouled by Rodrigo Bentancur in the build-up to Spurs' first goal. Additionally, Marc Cucurella appeared to have his hair pulled by Cristian Romero just before Kane levelled up the scores again late on.  ""I don‚Äôt think just some of the fans think that. I can assure you the whole dressing room of us, every single person, thinks that,"" Tuchel replied, when asked whether Taylor should stop officiating Chelsea games.  ""I can‚Äôt understand how the first goal is not offside and I can‚Äôt understand when a player is pulled by their hair, the other player stays on the pitch.  ""Pull someone else‚Äôs hair, stay on the pitch and attack the last corner. This is for me without any explanation and I don‚Äôt want to accept it. Both goals should not stand and it‚Äôs a fair result because we were brilliant, deserved to win. This is my point of view."" It remains to be seen whether Tuchel will face further action for these comments.

Borussia Dortmund most expensive sales - How BVB made over ‚Ç¨1 billion in outgoing transfers,"Borussia Dortmund have established themselves as one of the biggest clubs in Germany along with Bayern Munich in the last decade. In the last 10 seasons, they have won the Bundesliga once and finished second on five occasions. The Black and Yellows have not just made a name by becoming a challenger to Bayern Munich's supremacy in Germany, but they have also become a club known for nurturing some of the finest talents in world football. Several players such as Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ilkay Gundogan and Ousmane Dembele came to the club as relative unknowns but left the club as superstars. And on most occasions, the German side made big money by selling them. Norwegian forward Erling Haaland became BVB's statement sale for 2022 when he joined Manchester City for a reported fee of ‚Ç¨60 million. England international Jude Bellingham took things to another level in 2023, though, leaving Dortmund for Real Madrid in a deal worth ‚Ç¨103m, potentially rising even higher depending on bonuses.

'Maybe he didn't have the confidence' - Koulibaly suggests why Lukaku's Chelsea return failed,"Kalidou Koulibaly has given his view on why Romelu Lukaku's return to Chelsea didn't work out last season, citing a potential lack of confidence as the reason for his struggles at Stamford Bridge. Lukaku returned to Chelsea from Inter in a club-record ¬£97.5 million deal last summer, but has since returned to Inter on loan after an underwhelming first season back in the Premier League. Koulibaly and Lukaku met on the pitch in Serie A with the Senegal defender ending an eight-year stint at Napoli to join Chelsea, and was asked for some thoughts on the Belgian when speaking to press on Wednesday. Koulibaly was complimentary of Lukaku, saying: ""Romelu is a good player, a nice player, a talented player. ""He is very strong and I was used to playing against him in Italy ‚Äì I think he didn‚Äôt like to play against me!"" He added, opening up on his move to Chelsea: ""He scored a lot of goals in Italy and he won the Scudetto with Inter, so when he signed for Chelsea I was not surprised.  ""Last year I think maybe he didn‚Äôt have the confidence he needed to play like he wanted. Maybe something else, I don‚Äôt know.  ""Football is not all about the pitch, it is also your private life and everything else, so maybe it was something that didn't work with him over here."" After discussing where it possibly went wrong, the 31-year-old was keen to stress that Lukaku is still a Chelsea player and that 'maybe next year or in a few years he will come back and be better'. He added that he believes Lukaku can enjoy a positive season back with the Nerazzurri, but admitted his main focus was on Chelsea's own campaign. He said: ""We have a lot of talents, a lot of good players, a lot of winners, a lot of experienced players, a lot of young players. I wish Lukaku a good season but I wish Chelsea a better season.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/koulibaly-lukaku-chelsea-return/blt8abe2793f2f72b0c,Mitchell Wilks,1ad0cc51-d4e7-421f-9176-92b7f339933b
Appiah: How Juventus tried to stop me from representing Ghana at Olympics,"Ghana legend Stephen Appiah has come out to discuss how Italian giants Juventus attempted to stop him from playing for the Black Stars at the 2004 Olympic Games in Greece, Athens. After joining Juventus from Parma, the former Black Stars captain went on to play in 30 Serie A games and appeared in the Coppa Italia final. He also made his debut in the Champions League. In his second season at Juventus, Appiah played in 18 Serie A games. Appiah, 22-years-old then, was faced with a tough choice, when Juventus called on him not to represent Ghana at the summer games. Appiah has now explained what transpired. ‚ÄúI was told the club had received a letter from Ghana. Even before I went in, I knew that it was about the Olympic Games,‚Äù the 41-year-old Appiah told Asaase Radio as quoted by Talk Sports Ghana. ‚ÄúI went into the Sporting Director‚Äôs office only to see three men; Luciano Moggi ‚Äì Juventus Director of Football, Geraldo, the club‚Äôs lawyer, and the legendary Berttegga himself. ‚ÄúWithout even asking whether I wanted to go or not, they explained at length how much they needed me. They suggested I stayed and not represent my country at the Olympics. I asked for time to think about it and decide. They gave me three days.‚Äù Appiah continued: ‚ÄúI had previously spoken to some teammates who had been to the Olympics and what they described was unmissable. Beyond the immeasurable sense of pride of representing your country at the multi-sport event, it was a festival. ‚ÄúThe description of the Games village, getting to see other world-class athletes up close and in action was indescribable, they said. This was better than the World Cup. So I had to be there. ‚ÄúAnd on a personal note, I had played at the Fifa U17 World Cup once, twice at the U20 but never at the Olympics. This was my chance. And as a matter of principle, only injuries or suspensions could stop me from representing my country. That‚Äôs non-negotiable.‚Äù Appiah further revealed despite his stance, he was called once again for another meeting with Juventus‚Äô Moggi. Appiah stood his ground and maintained he had to go to Athens with Ghana. ‚ÄúI know they valued me. I was one of the more talented midfielders there. But this is Juventus where there are always options,‚Äù added Appiah. Appiah proceeded to Athens where he carved a niche for himself as a stylish and composed attacking midfielder, who had a deadly eye for goal as well. He scored twice in that short stint in Athens, shining in all three group games, running the attacking department in spectacular fashion. In July 2005, he was transferred from Juventus to Fenerbahce for ‚Ç¨8 million. He went on to win the Turkish Super League Championship with the club in their centenary year.

Man Utd forward Ronaldo aims to continue playing until he's at least 42,"Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed what his goals are in regards to how long he plans on playing football professionally. The Portuguese attacker rejoined United last summer, signing a contract until the summer of 2023 but it was unclear whether that will be his last. However, the 36-year-old insisted he plans on playing for as long as his body can handle, setting an aim of lasting until his early 40s. Ronaldo told ESPN: ""I feel happy to be a player who has shown who, in my case, longevity has been a crucial factor for me to keep playing at a high level, putting in good performances. ""Genetically I feel like I'm 30 years old. I take great care of my body and my mind. Something I've learned recently is that after 33, I believe the body can deliver if you need it, but the real battle is mental. ""Going through many things with the focus on the end goal of staying at a high level is the hardest thing, and that's what I've been doing for the last few years. I've been working and focusing more on working on my mind. I know my body will handle me because I have a lot of respect for it and I listen to it a lot. ""Life has to have important moments, for better or for worse, but when you fall you must have the strength to get up. I'm happy, I want to stay here and see what will happen. ""I want to find out if I'm going to play until I'm 40, 41, or 42, but the most important thing is that my daily goal is to enjoy the moment."" Ronaldo will take inspiration from Ryan Giggs, who was also a winger at United who adapted his game, retiring at the incredible age of 40. Giggs was United's oldest ever outfield player, with goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar beating him by a little more than a month for the overall record. The Welshman focused on his diet and yoga to help him last at the peak of football for as long as he did. As for the oldest player to feature in the Premier League at any club, that record is held by former Manchester City goalkeeper John Burridge, who played in England's top flight at the age of 43. Teddy Sheringham, meanwhile, is the oldest outfield player, having featured for West Ham at 40 years and 272 days back in 2006. There had been suggestions that Ronaldo would not be fit enough to face Aston Villa in the Premier League, having missed the FA Cup clash between the two sides. Ronaldo himself had claimed that he ""felt good"" and that he would assess his fitness after training on January 13. And Ralf Rangnick was confident that Ronaldo would be fit enough to play at Villa Park, saying at his pre-match press conference on January 14: ""I think they (Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, Phil Jones and Harry Maguire) will be available. ""They only trained yesterday for the first time, Cristiano yesterday, Harry the day before yesterday, so as it seems now we have to wait for the final training session this afternoon but, as it seems right now, they should be available.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-cristiano-ronaldo-continue-playing-42/blt0a418183c846cae3,Marwan Harraz,bb01d076-7a7e-46bc-a58a-1d97ae94c2c6
When will Erling Haaland make his Man City debut? Pre-season & Premier League bows for ¬£51m striker,"Manchester City have been in the market for a new No.9 since seeing club-record goalscorer Sergio Aguero depart in the summer of 2021 and, after failing to prise Harry Kane away from Tottenham, have finally settled on Norwegian frontman Erling Haaland. The reigning Premier League champions have splashed out ¬£51 million ($63m) on the talented 21-year-old, who hit 86 goals through 89 appearances for Borussia Dortmund and is following in the footsteps of his father Alf Inge by joining Blues at the Etihad Stadium. It is expected that Haaland will prove to be another destructive attacking weapon at Pep Guardiola‚Äôs disposal, given his track record for club and country, but who will he make his City bow against? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ The Blues are in the process of finalising their pre-season plans, with many players away on international duty or taking in well-earned summer breaks on the back of another title-winning campaign in 2021-21.

The first of those will see them face Mexican side Club America at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on July 20.

A message to Premier League defenders:Good luck. pic.twitter.com/Oirqn7D2N9 The plan for City and Haaland will be to get their elaborate new recruit up to speed before competitive action resumes. As defending Premier League champions, the Blues will finish their pre-season schedule with a Community Shield date with Liverpool at the King Power Stadium in Leicester on July 30. That contest will present Haaland with an opportunity to get his hands on a first trophy in English football, before the real business of collecting Premier League points begins a week later. City will be expected to unleash their big-money frontman on top-flight rivals from the opening weekend, with the Norway international charged with the task of leading their line.

De Jong would be 'great signing' for Manchester United - Ferdinand,"Frenkie de Jong would be a ""great signing"" for Manchester United if the Premier League club are able to pull off a successful pursuit of the Barcelona star, according to former player Rio Ferdinand. The Netherlands international looks set to be the subject of a bid from the Red Devils at the close of the season, as new boss Erik ten Hag looks to bring a countryman onboard at Old Trafford as part of his major revamp. Now ex-England star Ferdinand, one of United's most acclaimed stars of the Premier League era, has weighed in on just what his capture could bring to the club if they bring him from Camp Nou to Manchester.

Who is the most popular and famous soccer player in the world?,"Probably one of the biggest differences between soccer in the early years of this century and now is the influence of social media. While soccer stars have always had a reputation for living glorious lifestyles, the rise of various social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok in the last decade has given fans direct access to their favourite players and their lives. What this has meant is that the following and fandom of players has also increased manifold as these platforms help players engage with their fans in a personal fashion. And it's fair to say we've seen many colourful social media posts from soccer players over the years! From the below captivating post by Cristiano Ronaldo to Gerard Pique's now infamous 'Se Queda' post over Neymar's exit from Barcelona, there have been some legendary moments by soccer stars on social media.

Arsenal's ¬£45m bargain - How 'incredible' Jesus has transformed Arteta's attack,"Two games, two goals, six points. The impact Gabriel Jesus has made at Arsenal since his move from Manchester City this summer has been immediate. The Brazil international has been a sensation from the moment he walked through the doors in north London, transforming an attack that last season had looked largely stale and one-paced, especially in the central areas. Jesus served notice of his intentions during pre-season, scoring seven times in five appearances.¬† An excellent Premier League debut in the 2-0 opening day win at Crystal Palace followed and then last weekend the 25-year-old announced himself to the Emirates Stadium in thrilling style, becoming the first Arsenal player in the Premier League era to score twice for the club on his home debut. Jesus also registered two assists in the 4-2 success against Leicester City, making him the first Arsenal player since Alexis Sanchez in 2016 to have four direct goal involvements in a league game, as well as the first since Theo Walcott way back in 2012 to get two or more goals and assists in the same match. So it‚Äôs no wonder the ¬£45 million ($53.7m) summer addition, a transfer fee that already looks like a bargain, has dominated the headlines ahead of this Saturday‚Äôs trip to Bournemouth. ‚ÄúThat's the standard,‚Äù Mikel Arteta said, following Jesus‚Äô demolition of Leicester. ‚ÄúI wouldn't like to play against him. I have never been a defender but I can imagine that they don't enjoy it.‚Äù Arsenal‚Äôs problem last season was clear for all to see. Goals, or the lack of them, was a continued issue.¬† Whether it was during the opening months of the campaign when the misfiring Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was still there, or when Alexandre Lacazette was leading the line following Aubameyang‚Äôs initial banishment from the squad and subsequent departure to Barcelona. Lacazette scored just twice from open play in the league last season, a figure Jesus matched in just 12 first half minutes against Leicester last weekend. But the impact Jesus has made on this Arsenal team is not just about goals, it goes far further than that. For the first time in a long time, the Gunners now have a presence inside the box. While Lacazette did plenty of good work from deep last season and linked up well with runners going beyond him, he rarely got himself into positions that would trouble the opposition centre-back. In his 20 Premier League starts last season, the Frenchman had just 31 touches of the ball inside the penalty area. Jesus has already had 26 in his first two Arsenal appearances. He has also taken eight shots from inside the 18 yard box during those games. It took Lacazette until his ninth start (Boxing Day) last season to hit that number. Jesus‚Äô impact has been remarkable and Arsenal now look a totally different proposition going forward as a result. ‚ÄúThe work he does for the team is unbelievable,‚Äù Granit Xhaka said, while discussing his new team-mate. ‚ÄúWe're more than happy.‚Äù Happy would be an understatement, if you were looking for a word to describe how those at Arsenal feel about Jesus‚Äô first few months at the club. They were always convinced he would make a difference, that‚Äôs why they resisted the urge to dip into the transfer market in January to find a replacement for Aubameyang. But the ease in which he has adapted and the way he has settled so quickly has been a huge bonus to Arteta and his team. With Jesus at the head of the frontline, Arsenal have a fluidity to the attack that they were desperately missing last season. His relationship with Gabriel Martinelli has immediately caught the eye, with the two Brazilians linking up and interchanging positions exceptionally well on the left hand side during the opening two league games. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an example [to others],‚Äù said Oleksandr Zinchenko, who - like Jesus - arrived at Arsenal from Manchester City this summer. ‚ÄúHe was good during all the years I‚Äôve spent with him. He‚Äôs an incredible player, always hungry for goals which is the best quality as a striker. He doesn‚Äôt stop at all. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the guy who is always happy for the team. The team is always first and the club always in front of any individual thing.‚Äù It‚Äôs that type of character that has made Jesus such an immediate hit at Arsenal. While his impact on the pitch has been obvious for all to see, he has also impressed away from the public eye - with his personality and his work ethic impressing team-mates and club staff. One of the big reasons he opted to join Arsenal over multiple other options this summer, was the responsibility that Arteta was offering him. At 25, the Gunners boss was adamant that Jesus was ready to become a real leader and he has come in and taken on that type of role within the changing room, so much so that Arteta has named him in his three-man leadership group this season, alongside captain Martin Odegaard and Granit Xhaka. Club sources talk glowingly of Jesus and the way he has conducted himself following his arrival. Understandably he has forged a close bond with the Brazilian contingent at Arsenal and has taken summer signing Marquinhos under his wing, but he and the other Portuguese speakers are all ensuring they communicate in English as much as possible to avoid the potential for anyone feeling left out. Arsenal and Jesus‚Äô focus is now on Saturday‚Äôs trip to Bournemouth and the opportunity to begin a Premier League season with three successive wins for the first time in 16 years. The Brazilian‚Äôs impressive start to life with the Gunners has helped lift the spirits after such a demoralising ending to the 2021/22 campaign and Arteta will be desperate to ensure his side continue to build on the momentum they have picked up following the wins against Palace and Leicester. And with Jesus in the type of form he is in right now, few would bet against Arteta‚Äôs side doing exactly that at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday evening.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-bargain-how-jesus-transformed-arteta-attack/blt7fa7a794f7b85f46,Charles Watts,f4482580-1be7-4ff2-9f02-d35be4076134
'I might have been wrong' - Paris police head backtracks on Champions League final ticket claim and admits 'failure',"The head of Paris police for the Champions League final admits he may have been incorrect in his initial claim that there were up to 40,000 fake tickets in circulation outside the Stade de France and said the security effort before the match was a ""failure"". Supporters from both clubs received rough treatment before the showpiece event at the Stade de France on May 28, and have since had to deal with disputed allegations from French authorities that they acted improperly. Tear gas and pepper spray were used on children as attempts were made to push the crowd back and prevent a crush, while a large number of fans were allegedly able to gain entry to the game without tickets. Paris police prefect Didier Lallement¬†was the man in charge of the organisation outside of the stadium, and has now expressed regret over the harrowing scenes. He did, however, insist that the use of such extreme measures was the only way to prevent an escalation of a situation that could have resulted in fatalities. ""It was obviously a failure, because people were pushed around or attacked even though we owed them security,"" Mr Lallement has told the French Senate. ""I am fully aware that people acting in good faith, even families, were tear-gassed. For this I am very sorry. But there was no other way."" On his claims of the number of fake tickets outside the venue, he backtracked from previous remarks, saying: ""I might have been wrong on the figure of 30,000 to 40,000 thousand [fans with fake tickets] I gave to the [interior] minister. ""From an operational standpoint, it doesn't change anything if it was around 40,000 or 30,000 or 20,000."" Liverpool supporters also filed complaints about Saint-Denis area gangs that allegedly robbed phones and watches at knifepoint after the game. Mr Lallement went on to promise that he will identify those who were directly responsible for the violence at the Stade de France and bring them to justice. A UEFA investigation is now underway to determine the exact cause of the chaos, with Europe's main governing body having also issued an apology after initially blaming ticketless fans.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/paris-police-head-backtracks-champions-league-final-ticket/blta252bb4202492c83,James Westwood,3f45ea90-727f-466b-b851-aca2a1ac1044
Tuchel not keen on Kurzawa transfer after Chelsea offered PSG full-back,"Chelsea have been offered the chance to sign Paris Saint-Germain full-back Layvin Kurzawa, but GOAL has learned that Blues boss Thomas Tuchel is reluctant to take the France international. The Premier League heavyweights find themselves short on options to fill a left wing-back berth after seeing Ben Chilwell suffer season-ending knee ligament damage. Various options are now being explored when it comes to getting new or familiar faces on board, with PSG prepared to do business with their European rivals if all parties open themselves up to talks. It is understood that discussions have been held between officials in west London and the French capital regarding Kurzawa‚Äôs availability. PSG are, however, yet to receive an official approach, amid talk of Serie A side Napoli being keen, and have no bids on the table. That may remain the case when it comes to Chelsea, with the Blues facing resistance to a deal from their German coach. Tuchel previously worked with Kurzawa at Parc des Princes, so knows all about the qualities that he would offer in English football. He appears to be less than convinced that the 29-year-old, who has been restricted to just nine minutes of football with PSG in the 2021-22 campaign,is the answer to Chelsea ‚Äòs problems. The Blues are looking for a short-term agreement, with England international Chilwell set to be welcomed back into their fold alongside Marcos Alonso at some stage. They have already recalled Kenedy from a loan spell at Flamengo in his native Brazil and he could provide cover on the left flank if required. Tuchel would prefer to get a more natural fit through the doors before another recruitment window closes, with efforts still being made to cut short Emerson Palmeiri‚Äôs stint at Lyon. The Italy international has over 70 appearances for Chelsea to his name, but is due to see out the season in France. Lyon are refusing to terminate that loan agreement ahead of schedule, with three compensation offers being knocked back by the Ligue 1 heavyweights. That is forcing Chelsea to keep an eye across alternative markets and they remain open to approaches from agents ‚Äì such as Kurzawa‚Äôs ‚Äì when it comes to finding suitable solutions.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-not-keen-kurzawa-transfer-chelsea-offered-psg-full/blt7297c73a1f4b2279,Nizaar Kinsella,987d7a4c-9544-465e-83f7-0e923e88609e
"'Great manager' - Ten Hag deserves Manchester United opportunity, says former Liverpool star Kuyt","Manchester United would be getting themselves ‚Äúa great manager‚Äù if they were to hire Erik Ten Hag, according to former Netherlands star Dirk Kuyt. The Ajax boss is one of the front-runners to replace interim manager Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford next season, and was in fact interviewed for the role earlier this month. Some, including Dutch national team coach Louis van Gaal, have suggested Ten Hag should think twice before accepting any role at United, while the likes of Mauricio Pochettino, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique are also understood to be on the club‚Äôs shortlist.¬† Speaking exclusively to GOAL, Kuyt, who won 104 caps for the Netherlands and made more than 200 Premier League appearances for Liverpool, discussed the situation relating to Manchester United and his countryman. He said: ‚ÄúTen Hag is a great, experienced coach. He‚Äôs done his apprenticeship, if you like, with Bayern Munich‚Äôs second team, then Utrecht and now at Ajax.¬† ‚ÄúHe is a great manager who has improved himself so much, on and off the pitch. I know some people were doubting his level of speaking English, his performance in front of the camera, but you see him growing every week as a manager, and I think he can do a great job at any top side in Europe.¬† ‚ÄúHis tactics, his way of thinking about football, is very interesting, and it would be great if he was to get an opportunity at a top side.‚Äù Kuyt also discussed another big figure who is being linked with a move away from Ajax, teenage midfield star Ryan Gravenberch. The 19-year-old, who finished seventh in NXGN 2021, is wanted by Bayern Munich, with the Bundesliga giants tabling a bid of ‚Ç¨25 million (¬£21m/$28m) earlier this month. Manchester United are also believed to be fans, with Gravenberch‚Äôs contract set to expire in 2023. Kuyt said: ‚ÄúWe have so many talented players in Holland, and Gravenberch is definitely one of them.¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs doing really well at Ajax. He had a couple of games where he wasn‚Äôt playing, when Ten Hag was choosing other midfielders, but he‚Äôs coming back now and he is definitely one of the future stars of Dutch football. ‚ÄúIn Holland they speak a lot about him moving to Bayern Munich, which would be a great step for him, but also, we say that sometimes it‚Äôs better to stay a little longer and play a few more games here.¬† ‚ÄúSometimes players leave too quickly, and these days it‚Äôs not too easy to make the step from the Eredivisie to the Bundesliga or the Premier League, or any big side in Europe, because the level of top teams is so big.¬† ‚ÄúBut for me, he‚Äôs a future star and he has everything to be a great player for the next couple of years.‚Äù Having played in the World Cup final with the Netherlands in 2010, and then been part of the squad which finished third in Brazil four years later, Kuyt is well-placed to talk about the current Dutch side, and in particular its captain, Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk. Kuyt said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to see what the Dutch team is doing. After the 2014 World Cup, to not be involved in a tournament until the Euros last year, it was tough.¬† ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre back in the World Cup in Qatar, with Louis van Gaal and a great side. And to have a captain like Virgil van Dijk, a Liverpool man, it‚Äôs fantastic. Hopefully he can stay fit, because he‚Äôs such an important figure on and off the pitch.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs doing great. I follow every Liverpool game, of course, and to see him come back like he has, it‚Äôs so impressive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy to come back from such a tough injury. I think it was a very good decision from Jurgen to play him just once a week at the start of the season. You could see he was growing.¬† ‚ÄúAnd then when Jurgen trusted him to play twice a week, his level just went up and up. He‚Äôs now right up there at his best.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ten-hag-deserves-manchester-united-opportunity-liverpool/bltb9acca4d419658c4,Neil Jones,58b293e0-57ec-4946-ae03-1319c91d0d16
Watch: Phil Jones appears in rare social media clip to congratulate Man Utd U18s on reaching FA Youth Cup final,"Manchester United‚Äôs U18 side are through to the final of the 2021-22 FA Youth Cup, with Phil Jones making a rare appearance on social media to offer his congratulations after club captain Harry Maguire delivered a motivational pre-match speech to Travis Binnion‚Äôs side. A group of highly-rated youngsters that are hoping to follow in the footsteps of the fabled Class of ‚Äò92 and some iconic past cup winners such as David Beckham and Paul Pogba saw off Wolves 3-0 in their semi-final showdown.

Head of Academy Nick Cox said of United‚Äôs skipper taking time out to pass on words of advice: ‚ÄúHarry popped down to the dressing room before the game to speak to the boys. ‚ÄúHe approached us yesterday. Harry was watching Youth League games at Leigh Sports Village in the early rounds at the beginning of the season. He's got a keen interest, he watches youth team games, this isn't a gimmick, something he's done for tonight's game. This is consistent with his behaviour but obviously it catches the attention tonight. ‚ÄúHe approached us yesterday and said it is something he'd like to do. Travis and Harry have a relationship because they were part of the same Sheffield United group that came to Old Trafford in the Youth Cup in 2011, so that was something we welcomed. ‚ÄúIt was important for the boys to know they had support from across the club and the club captain, so it was nice he could pop in, say a few words, then sit back and watch the game with us in the directors' box. ‚ÄúI'm confident the boys would've been delighted to see Harry there in his usual reassuring and calm manner, sharing some words of experience. Of course, he's played in big games here as a youth player, he played in a Youth Cup final, so it was nice he could share some of his experiences.‚Äù #MUFC celebrate after reaching the Youth Cup final for first time since 2011.

Kido Taylor-Hart: Arsenal's 'extraordinary' teenager out to impress Arteta after injury lay-off,"Kido Taylor-Hart was a name on everyone‚Äôs lips at Arsenal at the start of the season. The young attacker had just signed his first professional contract with the Gunners, ending speculation about a potential move away amid interest from several clubs across Europe. And he had celebrated the occasion in perfect style, too, scoring two late goals against Tottenham in August to inspire Arsenal‚Äôs Under-23s to come from behind to win a thrilling north London derby. The 19-year-old looked set to take off, but - as is often the way in football - Taylor-Hart hit a bump in the road just as things appeared to be running smoothly. First, a formation change by new Arsenal U23s coach Kevin Betsy saw him struggle for a starting spot, and then a groin injury sustained in December saw the winger‚Äôs season grind to a halt just as plans were being put in place for what would have been an invaluable learning experience out on loan. It has been a frustrating period for a youngster, who has lots of admirers behind the scenes at Arsenal, but one he is now ready to bounce back from. And for those that have been heavily involved in Taylor-Hart‚Äôs journey so far, there is a sense that he is now ready to make his mark at the club he has supported since he was a young boy. ""Kido‚Äôs a special talent,‚Äù Brian Stapleton, the Arsenal scout who spotted the forward while he was playing for local side Focus Football as a seven-year-old, tells GOAL. ‚ÄúYou might not see him much in a game, but then he‚Äôll come out and do something very special. ‚ÄúThat game against Tottenham earlier in the season was the perfect example. He wasn‚Äôt outstanding, but then he pulled something out of the bag and won the game with two goals. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what good players do.‚Äù Taylor-Hart‚Äôs Arsenal journey actually started before he was spotted by Stapleton. At that point, he already had a connection with the club as he had been spending some time playing football at one of the projects run by Arsenal in the Community. The club‚Äôs community scheme was first set up in 1985, with the aim of delivering sport, social and education programmes to children in and around the local area. One of those initiatives was the Advanced Development Centre, a hub which was set up at Highgate Wood School, which allowed talented inner-city kids to train and work with qualified coaches. Taylor-Hart spent some time there under the guidance of Rupen Shah, who was the coach in charge of the U8s. ‚ÄúKido had just turned seven and was the youngest one there,‚Äù Shah recalls when speaking to GOAL. ‚ÄúHe was very shy, but I knew that Kido was something extraordinary. ‚ÄúThere was just no-one at that advanced development centre that had the technical proficiency that he had. He was clearly the best in our group.‚Äù Shah had the chance to work with Taylor-Hart for a few months before he suddenly stopped attending the development centre. The reason being - and this was unbeknown to Shah at that time - was that Taylor-Hart had just been spotted by Stapleton while playing for Focus Football during the weekends. Stapleton, who has scouted several players for Arsenal - including Charlie Patino and Daniel Ballard - knew straight away that the young forward had something about him. ‚ÄúFocus Football is run by a guy called Sean Daley, he‚Äôs a very good coach,‚Äù says Stapleton. ‚ÄúA lot of academy boys come from there because of the level of coaching Sean gives them. ‚ÄúAnd I knew how good Kido‚Äôs group were, but he stood out above all of the rest. ‚ÄúEven at that age he was composed, comfortable on the ball and he had good balance about him. He just used to float around the pitch. ‚ÄúSo I spoke to his father, got an understanding going and then took him into Hale End where he would train on a Friday night.‚Äù That was the moment Taylor-Hart‚Äôs journey with Arsenal properly began. He got stronger and stronger as he progressed through the age groups at Hale End, although he admits that his street-football upbringing meant it took him longer to adjust to the academy set-up than the majority of his team-mates. ‚ÄúGenuinely, it wasn‚Äôt until I was 14 that I started to really gain an understanding of tactics and how to approach certain things in game,‚Äù he said, during a recent interview withArsenal.com. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt like football growing up, I just didn‚Äôt watch it and love it in the same way that others did. In terms of my technical and physical ability, I was a very raw player and needed coaching.‚Äù Now 19, Taylor-Hart has developed into an exciting talent and has plenty of admirers at Arsenal. One of those is Mikel Arteta, who regularly enquired about how the winger‚Äôs rehabilitation was progressing during his recent four-month injury lay-off. Taylor-Hart had started becoming a familiar face at first-team training prior to his injury, and now he is back fully fit, it would be no surprise to see Arteta use him more and more at London Colney as the season starts to come towards a close. ‚ÄúPeople have forgotten about Kido a little bit while he‚Äôs been out,‚Äù says Stapleton. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs a great kid and he‚Äôll soon remind everyone what he‚Äôs about. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a tough few months for him but he‚Äôs very grounded and I know he‚Äôll work hard to get back to where he was. ‚ÄúHopefully he can push on now and I do believe he will.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kido-taylor-hart-arsenal-extraordinary-teenager-impress/bltb6bb047641ffdf1e,Charles Watts,f03e9734-12f7-4834-96f9-8b457f9922ca

Interim United boss Rangnick is better placed than most to enter that debate, having worked with a prolific Norwegian at Red Bull Salzburg, and he is wary of drawing similarities between two hot prospects. The German tactician told reporters when asked if Greenwood and Haaland are cut from the same cloth: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that we should compare those two players, they are different kinds of strikers and players. ‚ÄúErling Haaland is extremely physical, he‚Äôs 1.93 or 1.94 [metres tall], a different kind of striker. Erling for me is a target striker, he can play as a single striker like a target man or together with another striker in a 4-4-2. ‚ÄúI think Mason is more of a nine-and-a-half ‚Äì he can play as a striker, or he can also come from the wing, and he can play together with another striker. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very technical, left foot, right foot. Sometimes he looks a little bit not on an athletic level, and I think we have to develop him there physically. But technically all the things that he can do with the ball are outstanding. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm not so much worried about his technical level. We need to develop him physically and mentally to become the strongest version of himself and if we manage to do that he can become a regular player and a very valuable player for our club for the future.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/watch-greenwood-breaks-rashford-s-man-utd-record-with/blt9d723fcd589ad174,By Dan Edwards,70e58e6d-c753-4fb4-8ec4-2826a8a80482

"'No secret' we want Eriksen to stay at Brentford, says Frank","Brentford ""would like to continue"" with Christian Eriksen beyond the end of the season, says coach Thomas Frank, with the Bees boss admitting that it is no secret he hopes to remain in league with the attacking midfielder. Eriksen made his return to competitive football with the Premier League outfit in February, having signed in January following his heart implant operation in the wake of Euro 2020 and release by Inter. The Denmark international has helped give the Bees a boost, steering them to improved form in just a matter of weeks, and now fellow countryman Frank has admitted he would love to retain the star, while acknowledging any such decision will have to wait. ""I don't think it is any secret that, of course, we would like to continue,"" Frank told his pre-match press conference ahead of his side's clash with Chelsea. ""I'm pretty convinced that Christian is enjoying it here. ""But [I'm] also convinced that nothing will be decided before the end of the season from either side, so I guess I'll get a lot of these questions every Friday. ""I think it is clear that we would like to continue with Christian."" Since returning to professional action at Brentford Community Stadium, Eriksen has showcased that an enforced break out of the game has not robbed him of his influence or creativity on the pitch. Brentford have won two of their first three games with him in their ranks, with the Dane helping to tee up victories against Norwich and Burnley. But it is his international form that arguably thrills even more, with the attacking midfielder taking his Bees match fitness into the Denmark national team, netting goals in both of their March international games against the Netherlands and Serbia.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/no-secret-we-want-eriksen-stay-brentford-frank/blte1dd09d750609cd6,Andrew Steel,fd0c253e-17ff-4d87-9d75-45f0dcbad7dd
Watch: Coutinho scores on Aston Villa debut to earn draw against Man Utd,"Philippe Coutinho's return to the Premier League is off to a perfect start as he earned Aston Villa a point against Manchester United. The Brazilian midfielder made his debut on Saturday after joining on loan from Barcelona, coming off the bench in the second half of the Premier League clash.

Milinkovic-Savic reveals Pogba & Thiago inspirations amid Man Utd and PSG transfer talk,"Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has named Manchester United's Paul Pogba and Liverpool's Thiago as two players he has drawn inspiration from, as the Lazio star prepares for an off-season where he remains linked with moves to the Red Devils and Paris Saint-Germain. The Serbia international has been in fine form once more in Serie A this season, again stoking suggestion that a European powerhouse could mount a move for his services at the close of the campaign. United have long been linked with a pursuit for the midfielder, and it is two Premier League players that the playmaker has now named as figures who helped shape his approach to the game. ‚ÄúI learnt a lot from [Pogba] at the beginning when I arrived in Italy and he was at Juventus,"" Milinkovic-Savic told DAZN. ""He is tall like me, has technique and already made the difference in games."" On taking cues from Liverpool star Thiago, the Serbian added: ‚ÄúAgainst shorter players I struggle more because I have to duck too. ""Who do I take inspiration from? I always watch Liverpool‚Äôs Thiago. Some body movements I developed thanks to Futsal, a sport I played as a child."" After another fine Serie A season, the Serbia star finds himself back in the middle of the transfer rumour wheel, with United once again mooted as a likely destination if he is to depart Serie A. PSG have also been linked, with the two clubs allegedly namechecked in an interview with the player's agent - albeit one since slammed as ""fake news"" by the representative in question. The duo are likely to not be the only suitors interested in acquiring the services of the 27-year-old, who will be looking to register an impressive start to the new campaign after the summer ahead of the Qatar 2022 World Cup with his country.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/milinkovic-savic-reveals-pogba-and-thiago-inspirations-amid/bltdb479ec9e519a7ee,Andrew Steel,13ae4a67-f14c-4917-88ba-d2f071ad1f77
Maradona 1986 World Cup shirt sells for ¬£7.1m at auction to break world record for sporting memorabilia,"The shirt Diego Maradona wore in the second half of Argentina's 1986 World Cup quarter-final victory over England became the world's most expensive piece of sporting memorabilia after selling for ¬£7.1 million at auction on Wednesday.  Auction house Sotheby's had estimated a price between ¬£4m and ¬£6m for the jersey, which was previously in the possession of Maradona's 1986 adversary Steve Hodge.  However the reserve price of ¬£4m was reached within hours of the auction beginning, and its final price marks a new high in the sporting world.  Maradona's blue jersey sets two separate record for a piece of memorabilia.  It is now both the most valuable match-worn shirt, surpassing the amount paid in 2019 for an item once worn by baseball legend Babe Ruth. It is also the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia of any kind, a mark previously held by the original copy of Pierre de Coubertin's Olympic Games manifesto dating back to 1892. As well as having graced the back of one of football's greatest players, the shirt was also involved in two of its most iconic goals. Maradona wore it while scoring both of his strikes against England - the 'Hand of God', steered over Peter Shilton's head, and the 'Goal of the Century', perhaps the greatest World Cup goal of all time.  The late star's family claimed that the jersey held by Hodge, and which since 2002 has sat in Manchester's National Football Museum, was not the authentic version, but rather the one worn by Maradona in the first half.  Sotheby's, however, used Resolution Photomatching to confirm the article and there is no question that it is the shirt in which Maradona made football history.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maradona-1986-world-cup-shirt-world-record-sporting/blta331db9772310abb,Daniel Edwards,459f2d26-bbf5-4ef3-ae14-2183767d889f
'Real Madrid's offer was similar to PSG's' - UEFA chief Ceferin hits back at Mbappe deal criticism,"UEFA chief Aleksander Ceferin has hit back at criticism of Kylian Mbappe's new deal at Paris Saint-Germain by insisting Real Madrid tabled a ""similar"" offer for the forward. Mbappe reportedly became the highest-paid player in football history by committing to fresh terms at Parc des Princes on May 21. The 23-year-old rejected a proposed free transfer to Madrid in the process, with La Liga subsequently coming out to slam PSG for tabling a ""scandalous"" offer that puts ""hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk"" across the European game. Ceferin rejects the suggestion UEFA have ignored a breach of financial fair play regulations while claiming any objections from Spain are hypocritical given reports Madrid were prepared to hand Mbappe equally attractive terms. ""UEFA has financial fair play rules which are quite strict,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Whoever will respect our rules is welcome to play in our competitions; who will not respect the rules will not. ""Look not Real Madrid or anyone else will tell Uefa what to do. They are outraged from one point of view and, as much as I know, their offer was similar to [PSG's] offer."" The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) subsidiary named Qatar Sports Investments completed a financial takeover at PSG back in 2011, and have since helped transform the club into an elite force in both Ligue 1 and the Champions League. UEFA's decision to continue to allow state-run clubs has been the subject of much debate, but Ceferin sees no valid reasons why any changes to the current ownership rules should be made. ""I've said that many times and I will say it again, tell me one argument why they shouldn't be the owners of a club,"" he said. ""If you say that clubs belong to the fans, don't you think that the other English clubs have owners - they have owners from the United States, some from the Middle East, they have owners from England. So it's exactly the same situation and I'm really tired of these accusations without any concrete grounds. ""I want to know who broke the rules and if you break the rules then you will be punished.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-psg-uefa-ceferin-mbappe-criticism/blt51dc6f445e037f2c,James Westwood,3adf098d-c55d-4a83-a409-a275f2da6077
"Benzema, Liverpool and the winners and losers from Mbappe's PSG contract decision","Kylian Mbappe‚Äôs decision to sign a new three-year contract with Paris Saint-Germain is one that promises to have seismic repercussions in the transfer market for many seasons to come. Real Madrid were caught flat footed by the move, with the 23-year-old superstar having for so long apparently been destined for Santiago Bernabeu. It is a choice that has generated winners and losers all over Europe; some obvious, some less so... The mediocrity that has extended through PSG‚Äôs season was so seismic that it threatened to extend all the way to the top. Sporting director Leonardo has gone, but had Mbappe not signed his new contract, the revolution might have reached club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who has been in his post for more than a decade now. Instead, he finds himself secure in the job for the immediate future, at least. Without Mbappe, it is hard to imagine PSG building a competitive team in terms of the Champions League for next season. But with the World Cup winner remaining at Parc des Princes, the Ligue 1 champions at least stand a chance of reasserting themselves towards the top of European football, although the composition of the squad suggests this will be a project that will have to be given more than just one year. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be clear, Kylian is going to stay with PSG. We‚Äôre never going to sell him and he‚Äôll never leave for free,‚Äù Al-Khelaifi said last June. Had he been wrong, he might have found himself out of his post. It is not often that Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is left with a bloody nose, but that has certainly been the case in this saga, the ending of which has caught him almost unawares. While the initial reaction in the Spanish capital has been one of anger towards Mbappe, it is clear that the situation has been mismanaged by Madrid, whose failure to tie the forward down to a signed pre-contract agreement has bitten them hard. Not only have Los Blancos missed out on Mbappe, they have also allowed themselves to be beaten to Erling Haaland by Manchester City, meaning that they have missed out on the game's two biggest future stars within just over a week. Now, Perez faces an important few weeks ahead, in which he will have to plot a very different future for his club, having previously been so bullish over the signing of Mbappe. Right now, he is left looking more than a little foolish. Not everyone at Real Madrid will be unhappy with the outcome of this transfer saga. Rodrygo, for instance, is one who stands to benefit from the absence of Mbappe from the Bernabeu side‚Äôs ranks. The promising young Brazilian has had limited opportunities to impress with Madrid this season, but these will surely be more frequent next season without the ex-Monaco man to battle past. Rodrygo has sparkled on occasion this season, memorably in the closing seconds of the Champions League semi-final against Manchester City, but needs more first-team football in order to realise his potential. It took Vinicius Junior some time before exploding into the outstanding form he has displayed this term, and Real Madrid will hope that Rodrygo‚Äôs career can follow a similar trajectory to that of his compatriot.¬† If Mbappe had joined the club, Rodrygo would not have had the space in which to flourish. Now he has been given that chance ‚Äì and it is one that he must take. Shortly before the decision of Mbappe had been made public, Karim Benzema posted an enigmatic picture on Instagram which appeared to be his finger pointing to the Real Madrid crest surrounded in celestial light. While it is unclear exactly what the forward was getting at with his message, this doubtless changes the relationship between the pair. Benzema and Mbappe have struck up a fearsome partnership with France, which culminated in Nations League success in Italy last year. Their understanding in just a few games together has been impressive, and had they been given six months to work together before the World Cup, Les Bleus might have been unstoppable in Qatar. Now there are suddenly question marks arising over the pair. Will the chemistry still be there between them after this shock decision? Is it something that Benzema can forgive Mbappe for? These questions could be partially answered during the forthcoming international period, but even if things remain positive between the duo, there will always be a sense that they might have been even stronger on the international scene had they been club-mates too. Mbappe‚Äôs decision to remain at PSG is great news for Liverpool, who might have faced an acute attacking headache of their own had he moved to Real Madrid. The Reds face uncertainty over the futures of Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, whose contracts both expire in 2023. This would have only been magnified if PSG were in the market for an attacke this summer. Salah, in particular, has been on PSG‚Äôs radar in recent years because of their desire to have an Arab star in their team to appeal to potential supporters in that area of the world. Such a move now appears to be off the table, which is ideal for Liverpool, as with the looming threat of a PSG move, both Salah and Mane had greater strength in any salary negotiations between themselves and the club. That is now gone - as long as Madrid now do not turn their transfer sights towards Anfield - pushing the balance in favour of the Reds. La Liga president Javier Tebas was positively fuming when he learned of Mbappe‚Äôs decision to remain at PSG. He wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúWhat PSG are doing by renewing with Mbappe for a huge amount of money (who knows where and how it'll be paid) after announcing losses of ‚Ç¨700m in the last few seasons and having a wage burden of ‚Ç¨600m is an INSULT to football. Al-Khelafi is as dangerous as the Super League.‚Äù Lo que va a hacer el PSG renovando a Mbapp√© con grandes cantidades de dinero (a saber d√≥nde y c√≥mo las paga) despues de dar p√©rdidas por 700M‚Ç¨ en las √∫ltimas temporadas y tener mas 600M‚Ç¨ de masa salarial, es un INSULTO al f√∫tbol. Al-Khelafi es tan  peligroso como la Superliga. pic.twitter.com/sZ1Y1TaSbK Shortly after the decision was made public, La Liga released a strongly worded statement condemning PSG for the money that is being poured into this deal and asked that UEFA punish them for Financial Fair Play (FFP) infractions. Indeed, this leaves La Liga at an awkward crossroads. Barcelona are crippled financially, more than ‚Ç¨1 billion in the red and are seeking to sell assets in order to ease these problems, while Real Madrid have missed out on a star player who might have been a figurehead player for the Spanish top flight for years to come. They are now left with the question of how they market their domestic game in the absence of the game‚Äôs biggest stars. For two decades, the game‚Äôs shining lights have played at either Barcelona or Real Madrid, from Ronaldinho to Ronaldo, Messi to Neymar. Yes, Benzema remains, but he is in his mid-30s now. It‚Äôs official: La Liga is no longer a leading destination for the game‚Äôs elite.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/benzema-liverpool-winners-losers-mbappe-psg-contract/bltf6c23ff14e09dead,Robin Bairner,25776596-64c0-481e-85b6-1f14f882b3b4
"USMNT star McKennie 'best American player' in Europe, claims Juventus boss Allegri","USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie is the ""best American player"" currently in Europe, according to Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri, who has hailed the levels that the Bianconeri star offers for club and country. The 23-year-old initially crossed the Atlantic to join Schalke as a teenager, before a loan switch - followed by a permament move to Turin - saw his stock rise even further.  While McKennie has been dogged by off-field antics to a point across his playing career, he has further doubled down on his impressive skills over the past year during a tough term for Juve. Speaking at a pre-season press conference, Allegri - who guided the club to another Champions League qualifying finish last term, as their silverware drought continues - certainly believes he is close to being in a class of his own. ""McKennie is probably the best American player playing in Europe,‚Äù the Italian stated when giving his opinion on the star's quality. ""I think it‚Äôs very important for him to continue showing the high levels that he has at Juve."" With the Stars and Stripes having sat out the Russia 2018 World Cup thanks to a humiliating qualification disaster, the nation will be set to feature at this year's Qatar 2022 tournament. McKennie will almost certainly be expected to play a part - unlike several of his Juve team-mates, thanks to Italy's failure to reach the Gulf State event - and could well lead a fleet of European-based talent who make the cut for Gregg Berhalter's side. Other faces expected to make the cut will be Chelsea's Christian Pulisic, Leeds United duo Tyler Adams and Brendan Aaronson, plus Arsenal goalkeeper Matt Turner, to name a few.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mckennie-best-usmnt-player-in-europe-juventus-allegri/bltb73d242a2e84db7b,Andrew Steel,b0ebd79c-2402-4e29-a824-18ef24226062
Police confirm Greenwood bail extension request as they await hearing for Man Utd forward,"Greater Manchester Police have confirmed that an application has been made for the extension of Mason Greenwood‚Äôs bail, with the Manchester United forward arrested in January on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. The 20-year-old was first taken into custody on January 30 following the release of images and video online by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence. He was released on bail on February 4, with United having already taken the decision by that point to suspend him ‚Äúuntil further notice‚Äù. Investigations remain ongoing and it has now been revealed that Greenwood‚Äôs bail will be extended beyond April 30.

"West Ham vs Chelsea: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Premier League leaders Chelsea make the short trip across the capital on Saturday afternoon for a London derby against fierce rivals West Ham. The Hammers will be looking to get back to winning ways after three league games without a victory while Thomas Tuchel's men aim to continue their superb away form which has seen them pick up 19 points from a possible 21 on the road. West Ham have won three of their last six home games against Chelsea in the league and bet365 offer the hosts at 4/1 (5.00). Chelsea, meanwhile, are available at 8/11 (1.73) to claim their seventh away win of the campaign with the draw priced at 11/4 (3.75). Mason Mount opened the scoring in midweek at Watford and the England international is available at 9/2 (5.50) to break the deadlock on Saturday, the same price as Kai Havertz. Romelu Lukaku is the shortest priced player to score first, available at 3/1 (4.00), while the favourite to score first for the Hammers is Michail Antonio at 8/1 (9.00). Elsewhere for the hosts Tomas Soucek, who opened the scoring in midweek against Brighton, is priced at 16/1 (17.00) to do so once more, while Pablo Fornals, who has scored four times this season, is offered at the same price. Only the three teams above them in the table have scored more goals than fourth-placed West Ham this season and David Moyes' men have found the back of the net with impressive consistency. The side from the east of the capital have scored in all seven of their home league matches and, despite Chelsea boasting the division's best defensive record, West Ham will be confident of scoring once more. The Blues have conceded in three of their last four domestic clashes, and the likes of Watford, Burnley and Southampton have all netted against Chelsea this term. Both teams to score is priced at 19/20 (1.95) which looks like a healthy price given the scoring record of the hosts. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

"Real Betis vs Barcelona: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Barcelona travel to the Estadio Benito Villamarin on Saturday to face Real Betis in La Liga as Xavi Hernandez's side look for three points in their quest to secure Champions League football. A win for the Blaugrana would seal a top-four spot, although a victory for Los Verdiblancos would put them back in the hunt for a place in Europe's premier club competition. For a side chasing a spot in the Champions League, Betis have dropped too many points at home this term, with Manuel Pellegrini's men suffering six defeats already in front of their own fans. The hosts are offered at 2/1 (3.00) with bet365 to claim a win, while the visitors can be backed at 5/4 (2.25) and the draw at 13/5 (3.60). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the favourite to open the scoring at 4/1 (5.00), while Barca's most prolific player this season Memphis Depay is on offer at 9/2 (5.50). Ferran Torres and Luuk de Jong are both available at 11/2 (6.50) while the shortest priced Betis player to score first is striker Borja Iglesias at 6/1 (7.00). This fixture has guaranteed entertainment in the last few seasons and Betis have been more than capable of causing Barca serious problems. Indeed the side from Seville recorded a 1-0 win at Camp Nou earlier in the campaign although they have not beaten them at home in the league since 2008. Nevertheless another open game looks likely, and the last eight meetings between these sides have produced 42 goals. Barca have been in good form on the road, winning their last five games and remain unbeaten in away matches in La Liga since Xavi took over in October. Betis for their part are the fourth top scorers in the division and backing a goal-filled game should be of serious interest. Both teams to score and over 2.5 goals looks a nailed-on selection and is priced at 5/6 (1.83) while both teams to score in the first half could be of interest at 11/4 (3.75).

Pato: Maldini knows I'm ready for AC Milan return,"Orlando City star Alexandre Pato says he is ready to return to AC Milan should technical director Paolo Maldini ever call. Pato played for Milan from 2007 to 2013, bursting onto the scene with the club to become Brazil's next big star. Although his career has taken him to clubs like Corinthians, Villarreal, Tianjin Tianhai, Sao Paulo and now, Orlando City in the years since his departure, Pato says he misses Italy and that he would like to return to Milan. ‚ÄúI feel well in Orlando and I have a contract here, but Maldini knows that I am ready [to return],‚Äù Pato told Gazetta dello Sport. ‚ÄúI am more mature, I have a different attitude towards football and I could be more useful for young players. ‚ÄúI miss Italy and the Italians.

Marsch defended from Ted Lasso comparisons by USMNT legend Friedel after Agbonlahor labels Leeds boss 'cringe',"Jesse Marsch's post-match huddle against Aston Villa prompted former pro Gabriel Agbonlahor to make fun of the new Leeds United manager, but USMNT favourite Brad Friedel came to his defence and rejected 'Ted Lasso' comparisons. Marsch gathered his charges in the centre of the field after going down 1-0 to Leicester City in his debut on the Whites bench.  The result leaves Leeds just two points clear of relegation, and continues the awful run of form that began under predecessor Marcelo Bielsa.  ‚ÄúIf he has a struggle or a difficult time at Leeds it‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs American, it‚Äôs because he has taken over a team that‚Äôs low on confidence, that‚Äôs been in freefall,"" Friedel fired to Stadium Astro. ‚ÄúJesse‚Äôs knowledge of football is just as good as any European‚Äôs, just because his accent‚Äôs a little bit different, it‚Äôs not going to make him a bad coach. ‚ÄúThe players will respect him, they will like him, his training sessions are very good. ‚ÄúBy no means will he be anything similar to [fictional US coach] Ted Lasso. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unfair.

Iraq outshine Zambia in Asanovic debut clash,"Iraq secured a 3-1 win over Zambia in an international friendly that took place at Al Madina Stadium in Baghdad on Friday, as Aljosa Asanovic got off to a losing start as Chipolopolo head coach. The Asian nation took the lead in the 11th minute when Ishmael Dawood broke the deadlock with a penalty. They doubled their lead in the 23rd minute when Ahmad Ibrahim ‚Äì with an assist from Amjad Attwan ‚Äì scored to complicate matters for the former African champions. However, Chipolopolo scored at the half-hour mark to bridge the gap through a set-piece. Saad Natiq turned the ball into his own net when he attempted to clear a free-kick delivered by Albert Kangwanda. As the second half began, Zambia head coach Asanovic made two changes as he introduced Kelvin Kampamba and Alex Ngonga for Joshua Mutale and Kangwanda. In the 69th minute, Prosper Chiluya was thrown into action as Benedict Chepeshi made way, before Spencer Sautu replaced Harrison Chisala in the 77th minute. Just a minute after the Sautu-Chisala substitution was made, Chipolopolo conceded the third goal when Hussein Ghadban scored, and the Africans were unable to recover in the remaining minutes. Zambia have organized two friendly matches during the Fifa international break. After engaging Iraq outside the window, they will shift focus to the next game against Guinea on March 29. Foreign-based players are expected to be drafted into the squad that will participate in the matches lined up during the upcoming break late in March. New coach Asanovic had named a squad that consisted of only local players for this friendly, which is meant to prepare them for the African Nations Championship (Chan) qualifiers set to take place in June and July.

Juventus make Martial contact over transfer as Man Utd seek ¬£6m loan fee for wantaway striker,"Anthony Martial has made it clear that he wants out of Manchester United in the winter transfer window, and GOAL can confirm that Juventus have made contact with his representatives. The France international striker has struggled for game time in the 2021-22 campaign, taking in just 10 appearances across all competitions and no action at all since December 2. With a fresh start clearly required, and United willing to do business if a suitable offer is tabled, clubs from across Europe are mulling over approaches for the proven 26-year-old. The Serie A giants have been in touch with Martial's entourage, but have yet to make an approach to United. After seeing Federico Chiesa ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, the Bianconeri are eager to find reinforcements in attack. Massimiliano Allegri has charged his board with the task of delivering him another frontman before the next recruitment deadline passes, with Martial among those in his sights. There is, however, rival interest to take into account, with La Liga sides Sevilla and Barcelona also weighing up their options when it comes to a player with 79 goals for United to his name. Interim Red Devils boss Ralf Rangnick was quizzed again on Martial‚Äôs future at a pre-match press conference looking ahead to United‚Äôs Premier League clash with Brentford on Wednesday. The German had suggested in the wake of a 2-2 draw at Aston Villa that the out-of-favour forward had requested to be left out of his plans for a trip to the West Midlands. Asked about that situation again and whether Martial could figure against the Bees, Rangnick said: ‚ÄúI had a conversation with him on Sunday, a personal conversation about what happened and how I saw the whole situation. The matter is now resolved. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt train yesterday and the day before yesterday, he will probably train today and after training I will then take the decision whether he‚Äôs nominated or not. Let‚Äôs see what will happen then.‚Äù ‚ÄúMartial has made it clear to Rangnick and the board that he wants to leave United this month. ‚ÄúHe has been left out of all of United's Premier League matchday squads since the start of December after a conversation with Rangnick where he detailed his plans to depart. ‚ÄúGOAL understands the club are willing to let the French forward leave on loan in the next couple of weeks but only if a club comes in with the right offer. ‚ÄúIt is understood United want a club to pay the entirety of Martial's wages, which are in excess of ¬£200,000 a week, and they are also looking for a loan fee that could rise to ¬£6 million. ‚ÄúIt is understood Sevilla were interested in taking Martial on loan for the rest of the campaign but their offer was rejected as they could only afford to cover half of his wages. ‚ÄúRangnick and Martial had a 'misunderstanding' over his availability for the Villa away game last weekend. The German manager wanted to name the French attacker on the bench but believed the player was refusing to be selected, something the France international denies. ‚ÄúRangnick says the matter has now been resolved but has not confirmed if he will travel to Brentford for United's next league game.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-man-utd-transfer-martial-6m-loan-fee/blt95eff7662f488aca,Romeo Agresti,acf61b06-a610-4dc5-a2f3-373cc08cda1f
Koch has no Leeds relegation release clause & hints he'd stay even if club drops to Championship,"Robin Koch has suggested that he will remain at Leeds even if the club suffer relegation out of the Premier League, with the Germany international revealing that he has no exit clause in his contract. The Whites are still sweating on their top-flight status with nine games left to take in before the 2021-22 campaign comes to a close. Jesse Marsch‚Äôs side are perched just four points above a trapdoor that leads back down into the Championship, but Koch is convinced that they can steer a course to safety and end any discussions regarding potential summer transfers. Koch has told Sky Deutschland when asked if he would stick around in the second tier: ‚ÄúWe're not going down. ‚ÄúAnd if so, then I believe that the team will stand together. We agree that we'll go down together then. ‚ÄúWe don't go to the second division. I'm pretty sure we'll stay in there [the Premier League] with this team.‚Äù Pressed further on whether his contract at Elland Road would still stand if a tumble into the Championship were to be endured, Koch said ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Koch, who has nine senior caps for Germany to his name and is still harbouring ambitions of forcing his way into Hansi Flick‚Äôs World Cup 2022 plans, is not the only Leeds player to be sparking transfer rumours. Plenty of questions continue to be asked of how long Brazilian forward Raphinha will be sticking around, with the 25-year-old proving that he has what it takes to torment Premier League defences. Koch is a big fan of his talented team-mate and admits that he would not look out of place at any heavyweight outfit. He said of Raphinha, who Leeds are hoping to tie to a new contract if safety can be secured this season: ‚ÄúHe's a great technician, you can see that on the pitch. In addition, he has enormous speed. That's not a bad combination for a footballer. ‚ÄúIt's fun to watch him. He is a great player. He fits in with many teams because he brings a lot with him.‚Äù Leeds, who claimed a dramatic first win under new boss Marsch in their last outing against fellow strugglers Norwich, will be back in action on Friday when taking in a trip to Wolves.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/koch-no-leeds-relegation-release-clause-stay-championship/bltf0e234650174f556,Chris Burton,aabff998-285c-4e4c-883b-3828e09225d2
Wolfsburg make centre circle a 'peace' symbol & replace shirt sponsor as they make big Ukraine-Russia statement,"Bundesliga side Wolfsburg displayed the peace symbol inside their centre circle on Saturday amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Football clubs, players and authorities from around the world have joined in condemning the conflict in Eastern Europe that has seen many lose their lives as a direct result. And along with their pitch tribute, Wolfsburg also wore the iconic peace symbol on their shirts, instead of the logo of long-time sponsor Volkswagen, as they took on Union Berlin. A statement on Wolfsburg's official club website read: ""The situation in Ukraine and the images of its war-torn areas are a source of concern and great emotion all around the world.

Rebuilding Barcelona: Spotify sponsorship just the first step in Laporta's grand plan,"On Tuesday, Barcelona announced their new sponsorship deal with music streaming platform Spotify, a significant step on a long and potentially painful path back to financial stability. The ""poisoned inheritance"" left for president Joan Laporta and his board by predecessor Josep Maria Bartomeu is well known, with the club over ‚Ç¨1 billion in debt.¬† What was less well known was exactly how they planned to get out of it, especially after rejecting La Liga‚Äôs proposed deal with private equity firm CVC.¬† Even following the torturous departure of legendary forward Lionel Messi, and the somewhat easier goodbyes to Antoine Griezmann and Philippe Coutinho, La Liga announced on Monday that Barcelona‚Äôs spending cap currently stands at an incredible -‚Ç¨144 million (-¬£121m/-$158m), making the Blaugrana the only team in the league with a negative figure. The next day Laporta confirmed the Spotify deal, which has been in the works for months and will bring in around ‚Ç¨280m (¬£235m/$308m) plus variables over the next four years. It sees the club sell something close to sacred, the name of their stadium, which will now be known as ‚ÄòSpotify Camp Nou‚Äô. However, while in years gone by, this move may have caused outrage, now it is being viewed as a necessary evil, given the dire state of Barcelona's finances. Indeed, the deal is likely to be ratified by the club's members on April 3 with the minimum of fuss. OFFICIAL: Barcelona announce partnership with Spotify which will see their stadium renamed to Spotify Camp Nou üéµ pic.twitter.com/qI9h7Qvl9T Other sacrifices will also have to be made. It's even possible that Barca could sell a stake in the club to investors, moving away from their entirely fan-owned business model. It is believed former CEO Ferran Reverter was interested in selling 49 per cent of the club to foreign investors to allow Barcelona to continue competing with state-backed super-clubs such as Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, but Laporta was not keen on the idea. By contrast, the Spotify sponsorship is a far easier sell, with many fans actually in favour of the deal. While not quite at the level of some previous deals, it is respectable given the many caveats. Spotify is a well-known company across the world and widely considered ‚Äòcool‚Äô despite the recent Joe Rogan-related controversy. From a public relations perspective, it is also arguably a step up from the previous agreements with e-commerce group Rakuten and Qatar Airways. Laporta is also being given credit for the timing of the first major deal of the post-Lionel Messi era. Barcelona, remember, are presently competing in the Europa League, while the world is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic and now bracing itself for the economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Context is always key and the circumstances surrounding this accord have made it far more palatable for Barcelona traditionalists. The fact that 'Camp Nou' will not be erased from the stadium‚Äôs name has also helped. It will still be informally referred to as Camp Nou by most. Even after its renovation, it won't lose its name. We‚Äôre partnering with @Spotify to bring football and music together like you‚Äôve never seen before üèü The deal, which will be worth ‚Ç¨70m (¬£59m/$77m) a season, will become active from July 1, so it will have an impact on the salary cap calculations for the 2022-23 season, which will likely go from negative to positive as a result. Nonetheless, Monday's figure was a timely reminder of just how far Barcelona have to go to get their house in order and it deflated any hopes that the club can sign Borussia Dortmund forward Erling Haaland this summer. After weeks of supposed signs that the Blaugrana could battle for the Norwegian's signature, it now seems certain that he will sign for either Manchester City or Real Madrid.¬† ‚ÄúWe will not do anything that puts the club, or its finances, at risk,‚Äù admitted Laporta. Barcelona still have a net debt of ‚Ç¨451m (¬£379m/$494m) and will, therefore, be concentrating on ensuring that both Antoine Griezmann and Philippe Coutinho ‚Äì presently on loan at Atletico Madrid and Aston Villa, respectively ‚Äì leave the club on a permanent basis this summer. Barca will also be looking for buyers for players such as Samuel Umtiti, Neto, Clement Lenglet and possibly Sergino Dest. In terms of incomings, the focus will again be on free agents and the hope is that Ajax‚Äôs Noussair Mazraoui will join when his contract expires this summer. ‚ùù@Spotify is an important and modern brand. Our agreement with them is a step forward for the club. I'm really happy‚ùûXavi pic.twitter.com/pCdp93WhH0 Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen and AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie are also poised to arrive for nothing at the end of the season. Work must continue to raise income, though, and the club are looking at all potential avenues in that regard.¬† From their failed bid to launch the European Super League with Real Madrid and Juventus ‚Äì a concept that is not yet dead ‚Äì it‚Äôs clear that nothing is out of bounds. Indeed, GOAL has learned that the club are considering selling 49% of Barcelona Licensing and Merchandising (BLM), as well as a 49% stake in Barca Studios. Barca are also working on a new deal with CVC after rejecting La Liga‚Äôs plan but may be open to agreeing to some sort of compromise. The last resort would be selling part of the club itself. That cannot and will not happen in the short term, but it remains a possible if unlikely scenario. Right now, though, the Spotify sponsorship has renewed optimism among the fans that there is a way out of the financial mire for their beloved Blaugrana. Selling the naming rights to Camp Nou would have been once unthinkable but it might just be the first step towards rebuilding Barcelona.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rebuilding-barcelona-spotify-sponsorship-first-step-laporta/blt9f20f8aef20986cd,Rik Sharma,634392e3-2040-4e2e-8958-cdab82a292b7
'Stuck 60 years in the past' - Italy's World Cup failure a mess all of their own making,"When Giorgio Chiellini appeared for his post-match interview, the camera crew gave him a stool to sit on. He'd only played six minutes but he looked like he needed it. Chiellini was, by his own admission, ""destroyed"". Italy had just failed to qualify for a second consecutive World Cup for the first time in the nation's history, their hopes of playing in Qatar 2022 ended by a humiliating 1-0 loss at home to North Macedonia. ""There's just a great disappointment but we need to start over,"" he told RAI.¬†""But right now it's difficult to even talk about it. There's going to be a great void."" How had this happened, though? How had the reigning European champions failed to qualify for Qatar, eliminated by the 67th-ranked team in the world? Chiellini struggled to find the right words, admitting, ""It's inexplicable."" There were several reasons, though, chief among them Italy's inability to score goals. Did they deserve to lose on the night? Hardly; they dominated possession and had 32 shots to North Macedonia's four ‚Äì the expected goals [xG] ratio was 2.43 to 0.16 in Italy's favour yet Aleksandar Trajkovski decided the play-off semi-final with a 92nd-minute winner from distance. It was cruel but, as Chiellini conceded, you always end up paying for mistakes at the highest level, and the Azzurri's attack ran up quite the bill in Palermo. NORTH MACEDONIA IN THE 92ND MINUTE! üá≤üá∞ITALY AREN'T GOING TO THE 2022 WORLD CUP ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/S0N7rsI0R4 Domenico Berardi missed what was essentially an open goal, presented to him by an awful error from North Macedonia goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski. At least Berardi had been one of Italy's brighter players, though. His fellow forwards had performed pathetically. Ciro Immobile may be a Lazio legend but he has never managed to transfer his prolific record at club level to the international arena and some have already suggested that he never play for the Azzurri again. The 32-year-old certainly looked too slow and too cumbersome for the highest level.¬† Shortly before his 77th-minute withdrawal, he set off after an inviting through-ball and yet somehow managed to end up further away from the goal than when he'd started his run. By that stage, the diminutive Lorenzo Insigne, who incredibly seemed to shrink in stature on the night, had already been taken off after a painfully ineffective performance. There remains, of course, a wonderful sense of togetherness within Roberto Mancini's squad; it was this unity, combined with the coach's atypically adventurous approach, which enabled the Azzurri to triumph at Euro 2020. So, it was no surprise to hear so many players attempt to deflect the focus away from the misfiring forwards. Jorginho, for example, was quick to acknowledge that if he'd scored either of his penalties in the home-and-away draws with Switzerland in the group stage, Italy wouldn't have even ended up in the play-offs. ""I do still think about those misses,"" the teary-eyed midfielder told RAI. ""It will haunt me for the rest of my life."" Jorginho üíî pic.twitter.com/9oQgtoNzns Italy's World Cup elimination, though, wasn't about one particular player; this was a collective failure, one that extends well beyond what happened in Palermo. Chiellini pointed out that the players paid the price for mistakes made in previous matches, but they're also counting the cost of years of mismanagement at the very highest level. ""We're reaping what we sowed,"" as coaching legend Arrigo Sacchi told the Gazzetta dello Sport. ""We talk a lot, but you don't resolve problems with only words."" Action is clearly required, as there is clearly something wrong with the production line. This is a nation that once brought Alessando Del Piero, Roberto Baggio, Filippo Inzaghi, Christian Vieri and Enrico Chiesa to the same World Cup. On Thursday night, in their desperate search for a goal, they brought the recently naturalised Joao Pedro off the bench for his international debut. The Cagliari striker hadn't even scored in Serie A for two months! There is no more damning indictment of the Italian game, which has been underperforming at both club and international level for more than a decade. Remember, it's not just that they haven't qualified for the past two World Cups; they haven't even made the knockout stage since winning the tournament in 2006, having failed to get out of their group in both 2010 and 2014. In that context, Italy's Euro 2020 triumph cannot be framed as anything other than a beautiful anomaly, one made all the more unbelievable by Serie A's struggles to remain relevant in continental competition. No Italian team has won a major European triumph since Jose Mourinho's Inter lifted the Champions League in 2010.¬† Furthermore, just like last year, Serie A won't even have a single representative in the quarter-finals of the game's premier club cup competition. Financial disparity is often put forward as an excuse for such underperformance.¬† Italian clubs aren't backed by oil states or boosted by gargantuan TV rights deals like the Premier League ‚Äì so, the argument goes, how can they possibly compete with the likes of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain? But the failings of the biggest Italian clubs cannot be excused. After all, Atalanta, with their tiny budget but fantastic scouting network, remain Serie A's last Champions League quarter-finalists, in 2020. By contrast, Juve, the tenth-highest revenue earners in Europe, have bowed in the last 16 for the past three years. The playing field in European football has undoubtedly been skewed by money but, again, the Italian game really only has itself to blame for falling behind. The golden years are long gone, because of incompetence, corruption, gross financial mismanagement and a devastating lack of foresight, leaving Serie A sides scrambling around trying to make up lost ground by whatever means necessary. Most top-flight stadia are a disgrace, literally falling apart, yet Italian bureaucracy makes renovation or the construction of a new home almost possible. It's a turn-off for fans. Go online and you'll actually see heated arguments over the standard of the toilets at the likes of the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Is it any wonder, then, that the grounds are so rarely full? And empty arenas do not make for good television.¬† Say what you will about the Premier League ‚Äì and there is plenty to say about the way in which many of its teams make their money ‚Äì but it was, and still is, masterfully marketed. Serie A is anything but, with the organisers doing a woeful job of promoting their product.¬† The league's supposedly English-language Twitter handle has become a figure of ridicule, a microcosm of the Italian game's inability to appeal to a larger audience. There needs to be a complete change of mindset, from top to bottom, because it's clear that the old ways are no longer working. ""Italian football suffers from cultural backwardness,"" Sacchi said. ""There are no new ideas. Other nations are evolving but we are stuck 60 years in the past.¬† ""I‚Äôll say it clearly: the least culpable for this situation are the players and the coach. The problem here is institutional."" One of Sacchi's principal gripes is with the amount of foreign players in Serie A academies and it's certainly concerning that, as Italian Football Federation (FIGC) chief Gabriele Gravina pointed out, ""only around 30 per cent of youth-team players are Italian"". However, as Gravina acknowledged, that wouldn't be quite so big a problem if the top talents were getting game time in the senior squads, but they're not, with forwards finding it particularly to make the breakthrough at big clubs. It's been this way for years, though, so it's no wonder that Mancini's matchday squad for North Macedonia didn't contain a single attacker from AC Milan, Juventus or Inter ‚Äì Serie A's superpowers. Mancini has been criticised for keeping faith with those that served him so well at the Euros, but that was hardly surprising.¬† It would have been a bold approach to gamble on younger players who are playing so infrequently in Serie A, given he gets so little time to work with them anyway. Indeed, it's worth noting that the league rejected Mancini's proposal to postpone the final round of fixtures just before the international break, meaning he was left with just one full day to prepare his players for a World Cup play-off. There is no better example of the self-destructive nature of the Italian game.¬† The issue was raised afterward the game in Palermo and Gravina said while the lack of preparation ""didn't help"" and that the top Serie A sides see the national team as a ""nuisance"", he didn't want to ""cause controversy"" by discussing the matter any further. Not for now, at least. But it's clear that a new approach is required; both reform and renewal utterly essential.¬† And Gravina, who's been at the helm of the FIGC for nearly four years, cannot shirk his responsibility for this catastrophe. He and his organisation have spoken a lot about problems yet done very little to resolve them. Italy failed to embrace change after the 2017 play-off loss to Sweden; the same mistake cannot be allowed to happen again. Investment must be made in every sector of the game, and inspiration taken from the way in which France, Germany, Spain and England have all previously overhauled their youth programmes after crushing international disappointment. However, after such a devastating defeat in Palermo, it was difficult for anyone to look too far ahead, least of all Mancini. He understandably couldn't quite work out how, in less than a year, he'd gone from the greatest night of his coaching career, to its worst. Gravina, Chiellini and others urged him to stay on to oversee the rebuilding job, but the coach would only say ""The disappointment is too big right now to talk about the future."" Indeed, for now, there is only ""a great void"".

"'Factory workers can complain, not Guardiola and Klopp' - UEFA president Ceferin hits back at Man City and Liverpool coaches over schedule complaints","UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has pushed back at complaints from leading managers such as Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp over the domestic and international fixture schedule crush, defending his organisation's logistical choices. Both the Manchester City coach and Liverpool boss have aired their grievances about the fixture congestion faced by top European sides, particularly as UEFA intend to push forward with a drastic restructure of the Champions League. But Ceferin has hit out at their complaints, indicating that they have nothing to complain about as major clubs are unwilling to make the concessions required themselves. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy always to attack FIFA and UEFA, but the thing is simple,"" Ceferin told Gazetta dello Sport. ""If you play less, you get less money. Who should complain are the factory workers who get ‚Ç¨1,000 per month. ""Everyone wants more cup games, but nobody gives up on anything.

They should understand that two domestic cups are too many."" Elsewhere, the Slovenian expanded upon the plans to increase the Champions League, which will move to one singular large group format from 2024 onwards, in part in attempt to stave off future European Super League breakaway attempts. ""Today, you can already predict who will play in the Round of 16 after the draw,"" he added.

Chelsea transfer target Kounde wants to leave Sevilla 'to play in a more competitive team',"Sevilla general manager Jose Maria Cruz de Andres admits that the club will struggle to hold on to Chelsea transfer target Jules Kounde this summer.  The Liga side turned down an offer from the Blues to take the defender to Stamford Bridge in 2021. But after another impressive year in Spain, it appears that Kounde is set for a move away in the near future. ‚ÄúThe case with Jules Kounde¬†is very similar to the case of Diego Carlos. Not in the timing because we received offers for Jules Kounde¬†in the last two seasons but always in the summer market,‚Äù¬†Cruz de Andres explained to¬†Sport Witness. ‚ÄúWe have rejected because we thought that this player can improve his performances. It was better to wait because the market at the time was depressing. We thought that waiting a while would [help us] obtain more money. ‚ÄúAgain, the player, I am sure, respects Sevilla FC. He is happy with us. In the case of Kounde, it is not a matter of money. It‚Äôs a matter of him wanting to play in a more competitive team than Sevilla FC."" GOAL has reported that Chelsea put plans in place to return for Kounde's signature before the completion of the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital consortium's takeover of the club at the end of May. Cruz de Andres is aware of the Blues' interest, but says some of Europe's other elite clubs will also be keen on a deal for the 23-year-old France international. ""I am sure he is a player that is attractive for teams like Chelsea, FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich and these types of teams.

Carvalho shuts down new nickname at Liverpool & reveals initiation song following ¬£8m transfer,"Liverpool's new recruit, Fabio Carvalho, has disapproved of the nickname that was bestowed upon him by his team-mates after the Portuguese joined the club earlier in the summer. As per the club's tradition, whenever a new signing joins the squad, he has to go through an initiation night arranged by colleagues. It was ahead of his initiation that Carvalho was given the 'nickname' Bruno Mars. It is hoping that moniker will not not stick, despite initially playing along with it. The Portuguese revealed that on the traditional initiation night, he sang a Bruno Mars number having been likened to the singer by his new team-mates. ""We had a few days where we went for food at the restaurant and then there was the initiation with the songs for the new lads which brought us closer, especially for me as I had to sing and so the lads were just laughing and joking,"" Carvalho told the club's official website. He continued, ""Things like that just bring the group together, even the young players who came with us as well. It just brings everyone closer.  ""When I first came my nickname from the lads was Bruno Mars, which I've now said no to! So to stick to that little joke, though, I sang Bruno Mars' The Lazy Song. It was alright!"" With Carvalho joining the Reds this summer, he got to reunite with his former Fulham team-mate Harvey Elliott, who signed for the club in 2019. He also revealed that not only are he and Elliott former colleagues, but the two also went to the same school and their friendship goes a long way back. He said: ""It's been sick! ""We played for the same team growing up but we also went to the same school [Coombe Boys' School in New Malden], which is something that some people might not know.

Lewandowski: Barcelona is the 'best place' for me to win,"Robert Lewandowski says he is ready to continue his winning streak with Barcelona, explaining that he believes he is in the ""best place"" to continue to build his legacy. The Poland international finalised his much-anticipated transfer from Bayern Munich to Camp Nou earlier this week, and was on hand to watch them sweep aside Inter Miami in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday.

Caf Confederation Cup: ‚ÄòOrlando Pirates lost a final they shouldn‚Äôt have against RS Berkane‚Äô ‚Äì Ncikazi,"Orlando Pirates co-coach Mandla Ncikazi believes his side deserved to win the Caf Confederation Cup final against RS Berkane in normal time because of the chances they created at Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo, Nigeria on Friday. The Buccaneers suffered heartbreak for the second time in the same competition after they lost 5-4 on penalties following a 1-1 draw in normal and extra-time. After the game ended 0-0 in normal time, it was Berkane, who were awarded a penalty in the fourth minute of extra-time and it allowed Youssef El Fahli to break the deadlock. However, the South African side responded when Thembinkosi Lorch levelled matters, ensuring the match went into a penalty shootout. It was Lorch, who missed the decisive kick for Pirates as they lost in the final. Ahead of the final, Pirates were looking to make things right, since they had lost at the same stage in the 2015 final against Tunisia‚Äôs Etoile du Sahel in a two-legged tie. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very sad for our team. We lost the final and we lost a match that we shouldn‚Äôt have lost,‚Äù Ncikazi told the media after the game as quoted by Idiski Times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a match that we should‚Äôve won in normal time ‚Äì the story of our season: you create so many chances, you dominate the match, you just don‚Äôt do what‚Äôs most important, putting the ball in the net.‚Äù The 53-year-old South African coach admitted he was feeling for the players since they had put in a brave fight but ended up losing on penalties. ‚ÄúI feel for the players because they fought very hard, I feel for the team. It is what is right now, we can‚Äôt change it,‚Äù Ncikazi continued. ‚ÄúThe disappointing part is that it is a final we shouldn‚Äôt have lost based on the dominance and the creation of chances that created, but football is like that, if you don‚Äôt convert the chances you create, this is the outcome.‚Äù Pirates reached their second final after a 2-1 aggregate result against Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya while Berkane, qualified for the final stage after securing a 4-2 aggregate win against TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/caf-confederation-cup-orlando-pirates-lost-a-final-they/blt5853776362dd65e0,Dennis Mabuka,c0d51a2b-5091-43b0-87eb-a6d0edf7a235
Mourinho doubts Arsenal-linked Abraham wants transfer but admits Roma striker can make move happen,"Roma boss Jose Mourinho admits that Tammy Abraham merely needs to ‚Äúclick his fingers‚Äù in order to make a Premier League transfer happen but, amid talk of interest from Arsenal in the England international, he doubts a move will be made in 2022. A talented 24-year-old striker took the brave decision to leave a comfort zone at Chelsea last summer and take on a new challenge with Serie A heavyweights at Stadio Olimpico. After registering 25 goals in the current campaign, there have been suggestions that efforts could be made in the next window to return him to his homeland ‚Äì with Mikel Arteta said to be in the market for a new No.9 at Emirates Stadium. Abraham joined Roma for a fee of around ¬£34 million ($42m), but it would likely cost considerably more to lure him back to English football. With that in mind, and with a Stamford Bridge academy graduate enjoying his time in Italy, Mourinho has told Sky Sports of the speculation surrounding the forward‚Äôs future: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an easy decision for a young, local player to leave his club, to leave his house, his city, his country, to leave the Premier League ‚Äì which of course is a competition that, when a player is in it, it‚Äôs hard to leave. ‚ÄúHe made that option and I think he made it by trust in me, and I think in this moment, if he wants to go back to England ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think he wants now ‚Äì but if he wants to go back to England he just needs to click his fingers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy for him, back to the national team, loved in Rome. I don‚Äôt want to say he‚Äôs proven everybody wrong, because I think everyone knows that he‚Äôs a good player. ‚ÄúAnd I think also with [Chris] Smalling and [Fikayo] Tomori showing the English boys that there is life outside the Premier League and in Italy there is a life that makes them even better players than they are.‚Äù Tammy Abraham has scored more goals (25) this season than any other English player in Europe's top five leagues ü§© pic.twitter.com/WSYWndTh2g While offering no indication that he will be pushing for a move away from Roma any time soon, Abraham has left a door open to potential suitors by admitting that a return to his roots in London does hold obvious appeal. He has told talkSPORT: ‚ÄúWhen I see reports linking me with other clubs it makes me feel good, it makes you feel like you‚Äôre doing something right. It‚Äôs a nice feeling seeing your name all over newspapers. ‚ÄúFor me it‚Äôs about focusing on doing my business here. I can keep getting linked with many clubs but who knows what the future holds? ‚ÄúOf course I grew up in England, I‚Äôm a London boy. So maybe one day I‚Äôll be back in the Premier League to make noise there. ‚ÄúFor me right now it‚Äôs about focusing on Rome, on doing the best I can and hopefully winning these guys a trophy which they haven‚Äôt done in many years.‚Äù Abraham has helped Roma into sixth spot in the Serie A table, while Mourinho‚Äôs men are also readying themselves for a Europa Conference League final clash with Feyenoord on May 25.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mourinho-arsenal-abraham-transfer-roma-striker-move/blteef90341f93e009a,Chris Burton,2a3ab60a-45b0-4757-ac34-65b6cd9f1d3d
'It is crazy to compare me with Messi' - Barcelona star Pedri responds after stunning solo goal vs Galatasaray,"Barcelona star Pedri labelled comparisons between himself and Lionel Messi ""crazy"" after his stunning solo goal against Galatasaray. Pedri's 37th-minute strike cancelled out Marcos' opener in the second leg of Barca's round of 16 Europa League tie with the Turkish giants on Thursday night. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang completed the visitors' comeback shortly after half-time to seal a 2-1 aggregate victory, and Pedri played down his contribution after the final whistle. Similarities were drawn between the Spanish midfielder and Barca legend Messi on social media after his eye-catching effort against Galatasaray. Pedri doesn't wish to be mentioned in the same bracket as his former team-mate, though, and says his latest goal was instinctive. ""No way! Messi has scored much better goals. It is crazy to compare me with Messi,"" he told reporters when quizzed on the comparisons. ""I don't really remember the goal, though, so I will have to watch it back. I remember Ferran [Torres] gave me the ball, I feinted [inside] because I saw a leg coming and again, I think, until I shot.  ""Things just come to me on the pitch. I'm lucky in that I don't have to really think."" Pedri's modesty was not mirrored by Barca head coach Xavi, who added in his post-match press conference: ""The goal is sublime. It's of real beauty, the pause in the build-up ... Pedri is capable of that and much more -- and he's still only 19. What a privilege. I can't praise him anymore."" Pedri is now back to his best after a frustrating first half of 2021-22 that saw him struggle with a serious hamstring injury. The 19-year-old, who also tested positive for coronavirus at the start of the year, has missed 24 games in total for Barca, but made his 17th appearance in all competitions against Galatasaray. Pedri took his tally of goals to three this season with his memorable strike, and now has seven to his name from 69 outings in a Blaugrana shirt - 771 behind the club's all-time record scorer Messi, who is now plying his trade at Paris Saint-Germain.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/crazy-compare-messi-barcelona-star-pedri-goal-vs-galatasaray/bltfd5e014312edaa9d,James Westwood,0c0a6793-89b0-40ba-a6c3-6e91290a5b9f
Nigeria's Eguavoen lacks tactical knowledge to qualify for World Cup ‚Äì Ebunam on Ghana showdown,"Former Nigeria midfielder Arthur Ebunam has called for the immediate sacking of Super Eagles coach Augustine Eguavoen insisting he does not have what it takes to handle the side. Eguavoen was handed the role to coach the side after Nigeria parted ways with German Gernot Rohr and he was in charge when they forced a 0-0 draw against Ghana in the first leg of their 2022 World Cup playoff fixture at Baba Yara Sports Stadium in Kumasi. Ebunam, who played for BCC Lions, Elkanemi Warriors, and Rangers has rated Nigeria‚Äôs performance against the Black Stars in the first meeting at 50 percent and went further to explain why Eguavoen is not the right man for the top job. ‚ÄúI appraise the Super Eagles performance against Ghana below 50%. Unless the coach is changed because he lacks tactical knowledge of the game, l don‚Äôt see the team going to Qatar,‚Äù Ebunam said as quoted by Completesports.com. ‚ÄúThe team has no pattern. A team that played four strikers with two midfielders and four defenders. The strikers were lost during the game against Ghana; no through balls to the strikers on a transitional play or on the counter-attack.‚Äù Ebunam has further stated Nigeria will face a huge task to qualify for the finals to be held in Qatar if Eguavoen does not change his starting team. ‚ÄúHonestly, I don‚Äôt know if Eguavoen will make some changes in the line-up, but if it stays the same, then there will be a big problem,‚Äù Ebunam continued. Meanwhile, defender William Troost-Ekong has admitted Nigeria are under pressure to get a positive result against Ghana on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe are always under pressure playing for Nigeria every time we are putting on the shirt and representing millions. We know how much it means for us and for our families,‚Äù Ekong, who features for Watford in the Premier League, said as quoted by the same portal. Despite picking a 0-0 draw in the first meeting, Ekong feels it was a good result for the Super Eagles. ‚ÄúGoing to Kumasi and getting a draw I think it wasn‚Äôt a bad result and come Tuesday we are hoping to secure the ticket,‚Äù Ekong continued.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifiers-nigeria-eguavoen-lacks-tactical/blt3a12af3f05b49a98,Dennis Mabuka,b2dbb746-e486-4709-8951-538aa776a474
Chelsea consider Leicester defender Fofana as Rudiger replacement,"Chelsea are interested in Leicester City centre-back Wesley Fofana as they weigh up their transfer plans amid contract disputes with Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. The 20-year-old is currently out injured after suffering a broken fibula and ankle ligament in a pre-season friendly against Villarreal. However, the France Under-21 international remains regarded among the best in his age group in world football, including by scouts behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea won't make a move for Fofana in January but will weigh up a big-money deal ahead next summer as they must wait and see how he recovers from serious injury, with a return slated for the next month or so. The Foxes will likely set a huge asking price on their prized asset, though, with his contract not due to expire until June 2025. Chelsea are also still interested in signing Sevilla's Jules Kounde having had a summer approach knocked back by the Andalusian club. The France international wanted to move to the European champions but they never met his asking price. Now, in January, Sevilla will not entertain any negotiations unless Chelsea force a move by hitting his ¬£68 million ($90m) release clause. Juventus' Matthijs de Ligt has also been offered to the Blues ahead of a possible summer move, with the Italian giants open to a sale to remove his sizable salary from their wage bill. The focus on defenders comes with Chelsea having so far failed to renew the contracts of either Rudiger or Christensen. Real Madrid are leading the race for Rudiger, but the Blues remain more hopeful of keeping Denmark international Christensen at the club for a while longer despite having faced problems in negotiations. Their deals expire in June 2022, along with the contracts of Cesar Azpilicueta and Thiago Silva. However, the talks around the two more experienced defenders are likely to be easier than with the younger stars who are generating huge interest over a free transfer. Rudiger ‚ù§Ô∏è's playing against Leicester...pic.twitter.com/oHKomc1eiA Chelsea are facing injury concerns in midfield and at left wing-back ahead of the January transfer window. In both areas, the plan is to bring players back from injury rather than dip into the transfer market. Ben Chilwell has suffered a partial tear to his anterior cruciate ligament and it is hoped that he can return by mid-January at the latest. Despite attracting loan interest in the winter window from teams in Serie A, Chelsea will block Malang Sarr's exit until they know whether Chilwell faces surgery. Sarr's few appearances for the Blues have attracted stronger interest in him after only receiving interest from Eintracht Frankfurt, Greuther Furth and Brest last summer. Manager Thomas Tuchel wants everybody in his squad to stick around and is moving players out of position to cover injury-hit areas. Saul recently played at wing-back with only Marcos Alonso available on the left but Tuchel is also willing to play Callum Hudson-Odoi or Azpilicueta in the role. Chelsea also have the option to recall Ian Maatsen who has excelled on loan at Coventry City in the Championship. In a similar vein, should Chelsea's midfield issues continue into January, they may opt to recall Billy Gilmour from his loan spell at Norwich City. There will also be a recruitment drive for English-based academy players in January after Brexit has curbed big clubs from dipping into the European market to boost their youth squads.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-leicester-defender-fofana-rudiger-replacement/blt289da0613a2c5aa7,Nizaar Kinsella,b53746d0-e47f-4b30-8f15-580c657c1f2d
Saint-Maximin outlines his future plans and who he wants Newcastle to sign in summer transfer window,"Allan Saint-Maximin says he does not see himself leaving Newcastle this summer, while weighing in on who he would like to bring to the club during the transfer window. The winger was signed from Nice in 2019 and has established himself as one of the mainstays for the Magpies over the past three years at St James' Park, with a particularly impressive campaign this term as part of Eddie Howe's resurgance. Those performances have seen him attract attention as he has featured alongside impressive new signings such as Bruno Guimarees and Kieran Trippier, but the Frenchman says he intends to remain loyal to a side who took a chance on him three years ago. ""To be honest, right now I don't see myself leaving Newcastle,"" Saint-Maximin told GOAL. ""After that, there are a lot of things that can change. Several big clubs approached me for a future transfer. ""These are clubs that did not come for me when I was in Nice. Newcastle came at a very important time in my career. They gave me a lot of confidence. I am a very grateful person.  ""That's why, moreover, even at times when it could be very complicated for the club, like last season, I decided not to leave so that I had the chance. I feel good here."" With a plus-sized transfer kitty at Howe's disposal, and with glowing testimonials from their new faces so far, the Magpies are poised to become a major transfer player this summer - and Saint-Maximin knows who he would like to join him at St James' Park. ""It's a conversation that we will certainly have between players, with the coach and the investors,"" he said. ""The coach has a well-defined idea of what he needs for his team. If I had to choose, it would be the heart that would speak. ""I would most certainly want my friends to join the club. I am thinking for example of Ludovic Blas. I really like the person and what he also does in Nantes. He scored a lot of goals. It is an essential element [at] Nantes. I know that Bruno is very fond of [Lucas] Paqueta.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saint-maximin-future-newcastle-summer-transfer-window/blt14b4679207cb052a,Elyes Khouaja,94d6e3f7-c591-4c78-b0c6-c14d0c42b71f
Partey & Ghana sent crashing out of Afcon as Comoros secure historic upset,"Ghana and Arsenal star Thomas Partey faces an early return from the African Cup of Nations after his side were eliminated on Tuesday in a shock defeat at the hands of the Comoros. The Black Stars went into the final round of Group C fixtures needing a victory to stay in the competition following a loss to Morocco and a draw with Gabon.  But they struggled to bounce back from Andre Ayew's early dismissal and were beaten 3-2 by the underdogs, despite overturning a two-goal deficit earlier in the game.  Comoros were expected to put up little resistance against the continental powerhouses in Tuesday's decider.  The island nation are playing their first-ever AFCON in 2021, and in their first two outings were beaten by both Gabon and Morocco.  Nevertheless, it took them just four minutes to get on the scoresheet against Ghana through El Ben Nabouhane, provoking wild celebrations as they marked their maiden goal in an AFCON finals.  Ayew's expulsion 25 minutes in raised the heat on the favourites, and Ahmed Mogni then struck in the second half to double Comoros' advantage.  It looked for a while that Ghana would recover from those setbacks, as Richmond Boakye and Alexander Djiku netted to bring the game back to 2-2.  As Ghana pushed forward for the winner, though, they left gaping spaces behind, and Comoros punished them with Mogni's third of the game in the 85th minute, finally ending the hopes of Milovan¬†Rajevac's charges.  Elsewhere in Group C, Gabon, without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mario Lemina after the pair were sent home, were pegged back by a late equaliser from Achraf Hakimi to draw 2-2 against Morocco, sending them back into second place behind the north African nation.  Comoros take third place and must now wait to see if they make the cut as one of the four who will advance to the next round, while Ghana finish rock-bottom of their group, missing out on the knockout stages for the first time in 16 years.  The Black Stars' anguish, though, may prove a blessing for Arsenal.  The Gunners are set to benefit from the early return of Partey, having been forced to request postponement of their weekend derby against Tottenham due to a lack of available players.

Man City have held off a Liverpool title challenge before - are they ready to do it again?,"The last time Manchester City were in a slugger‚Äôs duel at the top of the Premier League table with Liverpool, they had a pretty easy time of it when they visited Everton.  Goodison Park essentially shrugged its shoulders in February 2019 when goals from Gabriel Jesus and Aymeric Laporte secured a 2-0 victory for Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side, safe in the knowledge that they hadn‚Äôt helped their bitter rivals and their hopes of ending a 30-year wait for the title.  The second victory of a 14-match winning streak, that was about as easy as it got as City exchanged blows with Liverpool right until the final day of the season when they won the league by just a single point.  Win after win, test after test, the two best teams in the country kept responding without a single slip-up until they ran out of games.  And here we are again.  City's slip-up at home to Spurs last Saturday coupled with Liverpool‚Äôs midweek victory over Leeds has closed the gap to just three points and once again there is no breathing space.  This time, City don‚Äôt even have the luxury of starting against a pliant Everton, with new boss Frank Lampard desperately needing points to stave off the threat of being dragged into a relegation battle.  Guardiola and the majority of his players have been here before, but just because they were successful last time doesn‚Äôt mean there will be anything taken for granted.  ""We both know what we have to do,"" the City boss said ahead of the Saturday tea-time clash. ""I‚Äôve spoken many times to the players: focus on our job. If it is enough to be champions then good, if not then congratulations to Liverpool.""  The City boss, outwardly remained calm about the situation in his pre-match news conference even if the reality of needing to win all or most of the remaining 12 matches will be another tall order.  But the challenge of it - as well as trying to claim a first ever Champions League title - means there will be little danger of his squad losing focus.  ""As I get older, I‚Äôm learning to enjoy my profession ‚Äì to be more supportive than ever,"" Guardiola added. ""I accept the defeats in a more natural way.  ""I don‚Äôt like it, because I don‚Äôt sleep well after a defeat, but I accept that the other ones can beat you - they can be better than you. You have to improve, that there is still a margin to do better that we are still not doing.  ""I enjoy it. I‚Äôm not so dramatic, like: 'We are going to lose the Premier League'. What‚Äôs the problem? The problem is how you behave and how you are as a team, knowing that we want to win it ‚Äì we want to do it.""  The similarities between the teams that played out a spectacular title race three seasons ago are clear.  Liverpool can still be unstoppable with a dynamic attacking threat running through the team from full-backs to forwards - now with the added threat of Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz. City, meanwhile, maintain their control and domination, waiting for their opportunities to produce a killer moment.  The differences are small, however, they are there all the same.  Defensively, Jurgen Klopp's side aren't as mean as they were, having conceded 33 percent more goals than at the same time three years ago.  It's at the other end where City could be short, missing a striker and in particular one of Sergio Aguero's quality.  The Argentinian twice scored the winner in 1-0 victories during their title run-in, most notably the tense victory away to Burnley when his winning goal crossed the line by less than an inch.  It was the smallest of margins and so eventually was the title race, settled on the last day of the campaign.  Many expect the same challenge again but the way the gap has come down so quickly is still surprising. But when Guardiola described Liverpool as a ""pain in the ***"", it was because he knew they weren't going to surrender their challenge.  Now with the difference down to three points and a huge clash to come at the Etihad Stadium in April, they will race them all the way to the finish line.  And the way to keep their rivals in second place is simple from Guardiola's perspective.  ""I know what we have to do to beat Liverpool, we have to win a lot of games,"" he said. ""I didn‚Äôt just know that now. I knew it when we were 11 or 12 points ahead and they had two games in hand. I knew it, I felt it. I know the opponents and what can happen.""  From Saturday's return to Merseyside right up until the visit of Steven Gerrard's Aston Villa on the last day of the season, no one at City is expecting anything other than a fight to the end.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-have-held-off-a-liverpool-title-challenge-before/blt80218a31b3a3cc7c,Jonathan Smith,e89c28b2-1981-4bee-b9b7-12c2e81a9c04
Arsenal's Aubameyang dilemma: Arteta faces season-defining decision as Vlahovic uncertainty grows,"What do you do with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang? It's a question that Arsenal are debating right now and whatever they decide could prove pivotal to the club‚Äôs season. Aubameyang has not kicked a ball for the Gunners since the¬†Premier League loss at Everton on December¬†6, with the 32-year-old finding himself banished from the squad having been disciplined for arriving back late from an overseas trip to see his mother. It was the latest in a series of disciplinary breaches by the frontman and resulted in him being stripped of the captaincy by Mikel Arteta. The striker‚Äôs future has been in doubt ever since and now Arsenal are mulling over a firm bid for the former skipper from Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr, whilst there is also believed to be interest in him from several clubs across Europe. The offer from Al Nassr is for a loan until the end of the season, with an obligation to buy in the summer for around ¬£6.7 million ($9.1m). So far Arsenal have yet to respond, with Arteta and the club hierarchy still pondering what they should do. And it‚Äôs no surprise that they are taking their time as the decision could go a long way to deciding whether Arsenal can sustain their push for a top four finish in the Premier League this season. Arsenal would like to accept the bid and move on ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not as simple as that. Ever since Aubameyang was taken out of the squad, Arteta has been using Alexandre Lacazette as his central striker, with Eddie Nketiah his primary back-up option. So far, that has been enough for Arsenal to get by, but after a free-scoring end to December, the goals have dried up in January, with the Gunners scoring just once in four games. So, it would be a big risk to commit to playing the entire second half of the season with Lacazette and Nketiah ‚Äì who have just three league goals between them this season ‚Äì as your only central strikers. There is also the added complication that both are out of contract in the summer and expected to leave. Arteta has previously insisted that he is not concerned by either player's contractual status and he is confident both will continue to play with total commitment despite knowing they will be free agents at the end of the campaign. However, he will know that is far from an ideal situation, which is why the Gunners are in the market for at least one striker. ‚ÄúAt the moment, [the squad] is extremely thin,‚Äù Arteta admitted prior to Thursday night‚Äôs Carabao Cup semi-final defeat against Liverpool. ‚ÄúThat is why we have a plan to try to bring players in with the right qualities to improve the squad in the best possible way.‚Äù The big issue facing Arsenal, however, is being able to sign a top-quality striker in January. Dusan Vlahovic, the Fiorentina forward, is the name on everyone‚Äôs lips, but he and his agent are understandably keen to wait until the summer before deciding on his next move. With just 18 months left on his contract, Fiorentina want a transfer sorted now to ensure they get as high a fee as possible. However, Vlahovic and his representatives know that he will have a host of clubs queuing up for him this summer and, crucially, he will also know which of those interested clubs can offer him Champions League football. It will, therefore, be immensely difficult for anyone to convince him to make a move now. Arsenal hold a strong interest in Jonathan David and talks took place between technical director Edu and the Lille forward‚Äôs agent before Christmas to establish the Canada international‚Äôs availability. Again, though, David‚Äôs preference is to stay put until the end of the season before taking the next step in his career. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is another striker on Arsenal‚Äôs list, but it‚Äôs extremely unlikely that Everton would even consider allowing their star striker to leave in January while they are flirting with relegation. And that all leaves Arsenal in a difficult position when it comes to Aubameyang. On one hand, the prospect of removing his ¬£340,000 ($460,000) salary from the wage bill 18 months ahead of schedule is an enticing one, especially with a transfer fee ‚Äì albeit a relatively modest one ‚Äì also on the table in the summer. However, can they afford to take the risk of letting him leave now, when there is still so much of the season to play and without having a replacement already through the door? Of course, Arteta does have the option of making peace with his former captain. Should he bring him back into the fold, that would give the Gunners time to work on securing one of their key striker targets for the summer. A lot could depend on the results of the medical checks that Aubameyang has been undergoing with specialists in London during the past few days. Just as it seemed he was about to be available again, he was sent back to England ‚Äì with the Gabon FA announcing he had suffered some sort of cardiac complication. ‚ÄúHe is in London and now he is going through some examinations,‚Äù Arteta confirmed on Wednesday.¬† ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had any clarity from the Gabon national team about the reasons why he came back ,so obviously it is our obligation to make sure that medically the player is safe. ‚ÄúHistorically, everything we have done with the player, he has never had an issue. Hopefully, that is the case.‚Äù Aubameyang has since taken to social media to reveal that the checks didn‚Äôt pick up any issue. ‚ÄúMy heart is absolutely fine and I‚Äôm completely healthy,‚Äù he said, whilst also stating that he was ""already back at it"". Should that indeed be the case, then Arsenal have to decide what to do with Aubameyang. Either Arteta brings him back into the fold or the club lines up a replacement before letting the forward leave. Should Arsenal fail to do either, then a season that promised so much, could end up running out of steam.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-aubameyang-decision-vlahovic-uncertainty/blt69ab1b1f0a705d0b,Charles Watts,5e1a88a4-b590-4dee-bed5-427429c8b318
Nigeria must beware of growing Ghana force as Kudus excels in Kumasi,"Nigeria appeared to be largely pleased with their away first leg 0-0 draw in Friday‚Äôs World Cup playoff against Ghana. Ahead of the match, talk abounded about the ominous prospect of playing at the Baba Yara Stadium, and of the Black Stars‚Äô track record in Kumasi, but in the end, there was no repeat of Ghana‚Äôs famous 6-1 demolition of Egypt at the same stage four years ago. Instead, the two sides neutralised each other in a 0-0 draw that leaves both sides fancying their chances ahead of the return leg. Nigeria, who negotiated Kumasi, will be confident that they can take control in front of their own fans, while Ghana, coming off the back of a miserable Africa Cup of Nations, can take solace from how they stymied a stronger side. In my opinion, it‚Äôs the Black Stars who can be happier with how Friday‚Äôs fixture went, even if home advantage has now passed them by without their being able to secure a victory. Admittedly, Ghana offered precious little going forward, and clearly lack a cutting edge, but they have the kind of structure and form under new coach Otto Addo that wasn‚Äôt as apparent for Nigeria under Augustine Eguavoen. The Black Stars introduced an extra man into the heart of the park, with Mohammed Kudus playing ahead of Thomas Partey and Iddrisu Baba, and it gave them the control and solidity that had been lacking during the Nations Cup. Ok, so they didn‚Äôt get a goal in front of their home fans, but this was a marked change‚Äîand improvement‚Äîon the fare served up under Milovan Rajevac at the Nations Cup. Rajevac, of course, had to do without an unfit Kudus in Cameroon, and his introduction here enhanced both the midfield and the attack. With the Ajax youngster leading the charge, Partey could focus on more modest duties alongside Baba‚Äîboth of whom were helped by the absence of Wilfred Ndidi‚Äîwhile Kudus‚Äôs forward movement helped create space for those around him. Admittedly, perhaps the Dutch-based star‚Äôs use of the ball let him down on occasion, but Nigeria struggled to deal with his forays forward‚Äîand his footwork‚Äîwhich should offer some hope when the Eagles push forward in search of a winner in the return leg. While Jordan Ayew‚Äôs lack of goals appears unlikely to be remedied any time soon, he also played a critical role in battling with the Nigerian defenders, running the channels, and creating space for those around him. With Daniel-Kofi Kyereh using the ball intelligently during the latter stages, Felix Afena-Gyan showing maturity beyond his years on his international debut, and Abdul Issahaku showing promise in abundance, Ghana suddenly have an attacking schema brimming with ideas and invention. If they can transform that menace into a goal threat‚Äîand it isn‚Äôt immediately apparent to see where the goals will come from‚Äîthen they can stun Nigeria in Abuja on Tuesday.

Had Richmond Boakye been fit, he too could have given the Black Stars a focal point and a goal threat when they needed, having been underutilised by Rajevac in Cameroon, but Addo appears to have the nous and the vision to maximise the talent Ghana do have at their disposal currently. ‚ÄúThe result doesn‚Äôt change anything because we wanted to win and I think the Nigerians saw we can play as well,‚Äù he told journalists after the match. ‚ÄúThey are not up and we, down, even though the Afcon was not good, I think we matched them up and got respect,‚Äù the coach concluded. ‚ÄúThey have high-quality players, but I do not see them in the [advantage], the pressure will be on them a lot [in the second leg in Abuja].  ‚ÄúAway goals can hurt a lot.‚Äù Ghana remain outsiders across a one-off shootout for Qatar, but Addo and Kudus have at least restored some Black Stars pride following that miserable Nations Cup showing in Cameron.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nigeria-must-beware-of-growing-ghana-force-as-kudus-excels/blt06b4b338ccb9458e,Ed Dove,4f35683a-2e81-4d42-9913-dab436a8ee75
‚ÄòIt only took six years and a new hairline!‚Äô - Ramsdale jokes with Holding after Arsenal defender's first Premier League goal,"Aaron Ramsdale was happy to tease Arsenal team-mate Rob Holding after seeing him open his Premier League goal account against West Ham, with the Gunners goalkeeper eager to point out that it had taken ‚Äúsix years and a new hairline‚Äù for a club colleague to achieve that feat. The Gunners saw their defensive unit do the business during a meeting with the Hammers at the London Stadium, with Brazilian centre-half Gabriel Magalhaes also getting on the scoresheet in a 2-1 win. Holding was the man to put them on their way to a much-needed victory in an ongoing top-four bid, with the 26-year-old breaking his top-flight duck at the 81st time of asking. Arsenal‚Äôs goalkeeper could not resist taking a little dig at Holding after seeing him end a long wait for a Premier League moment to celebrate, with the England international telling Sky Sports: ‚ÄúIt only took six years and a new hairline!‚Äù Holding is happy to take the banter as, after previously netting in the Carabao Cup and Europa League, he finally has one monkey off his back. He said of opening his account: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve scored a few Carabao Cup goals but it‚Äôs nice to get my first Premier League goal and hopefully I can build on that now and get some more. ‚ÄúA clean sheet would have been a perfect day, but we were there or thereabouts.‚Äù Victory for Arsenal in east London has cemented their standing inside the Premier League‚Äôs top four. They are guaranteed European qualification for next season and could yet chase down Chelsea to finish in third place. Champions League football remains the ultimate target for Mikel Arteta‚Äôs men, but they know that nothing can be taken for granted. Arch-rivals Tottenham are still breathing down their neck, ahead of a crucial derby date on May 12, and Ramsdale is eager to keep collective focus locked on what the Gunners can do. He said when asked about an intriguing tussle with London neighbours: ‚ÄúIt was vital we won. I didn't know the [Tottenham] score before I went out but of course that was important if we want fourth or even third if we are looking higher.‚Äù Arsenal will be back in action next Sunday when they play host to relegation-threatened Leeds.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/six-years-new-hairline-ramsdale-jokes-holding-arsenal/bltaeefe316e7383526,Chris Burton,9c13a9d3-83c1-4625-950e-02351c253a4f
Camila Cabello complains of 'rude' fans following Champions League final performance,"Camila Cabello hit out at the ""rude"" fans after they sang over her performance at the Champions League final. The 25-year-old singer took to the stage to perform the opening ceremony for the final at the Stade de France on Saturday. But Cabello's voice was overpowered by the thousands of Liverpool and Real Madrid fans who sang over her. Cabello took to Twitter to voice her frustration, though she has since deleted the posts. She wrote: ‚ÄúPlaying back our performance and I can‚Äôt believe people were singing their teams‚Äô anthems so loud during our performance.  ""Like, my team and I worked tireless for so long to bring right vibes and give a good show. ‚ÄúVery rude but whatever. I‚ÄôM GLAD U GUYS LOVED IT!!!!!"" The fans' treatment of Cabello was not the most controversial incident around the match. Kick-off had to be delayed for over 35 minutes because of trouble outside the stadium, with a large number of supporters denied entry despite having tickets. Some supporters resorted to climbing over barriers to get into the stadium, resulting in police using tear gas in an attempt to control the situation.

Chelsea boss Tuchel issues verdict on Broja's future amid transfer speculation,"Thomas Tuchel does not expect Chelsea forward Armando Broja to depart the club this summer, despite interest from a host of Premier League rivals. The attacker spent last season on loan with Southampton and has attracted the attention of several other top-flight clubs, including West Ham and Everton. But speaking before his side take on MLS outfit Charlotte as part of their pre-season tour of the United States, Tuchel stated that while he knows of interest in the forward, he anticipates he will stay at Stamford Bridge. ""I don't expect Armando to leave,"" Tuchel told his pre-match press conference ahead of Wednesday's game. ""We are aware of offers and interest. We will take this decision together with the owner and the player. ""When he was here I was aware that he was trying to impress and become a Chelsea player as soon as possible."" With Romelu Lukaku dispatched back to Inter on loan, a potential place for Broja has opened up at the front of the Blues' attack, with Tuchel's outright strike options more limited than before. While new recruit Raheem Sterling could feasibly function as a nine, the England winger is anticipated to operate out wide for the Blues this season. Chelsea's only nominal strike options therefore are Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Michy Batshuayi, with Broja possibly set to battle the latter for the back-up spot - unless Tuchel acquires another major marksman up front.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-boss-tuchel-issues-verdict-broja-future-transfer/blt20f87207592a2df2,Andrew Steel,48a6410c-35e2-4e73-ac7f-2271a2ba5b3d
"Azpilicueta's Chelsea contract will be renewed, but Barcelona still want to sign Blues captain","Chelsea look set to renew Cesar Azpilicueta's contract, which will create a further block on Barcelona's intention to sign the 32-year-old on a free transfer or for a nominal fee. Thanks to a clause in Chelsea's agreement with their captain, another year on the Spaniard's deal will be activated based on certain conditions.  However, there is a lot of goodwill between Chelsea and the Blues captain, who is negotiating the situation without an agent, and they could step aside should he push for a new opportunity.  Chelsea have an option to extend Azpilicueta's contract for another year but it is conditional on his appearances in certain competitions.  Although the exact numbers are unknown, the defender is thought to be close to hitting the figure that would spark a renewal.  The Blues are currently under sanctions because of their owner Roman Abramovich and alleged connections to the Kremlin and Russian president¬†Vladimir Putin.  It blocks both transfers and contract renewals but Azpilicueta's deal would likely be waved through due to it being agreed before March 10.  Barcelona remain as confident as ever despite finding out about the clause in the contract.  The deciding point on whether they can complete the deal is by convincing Azpilicueta himself. They have offered a competitive two-year contract with an option for an extra year.  That's one year longer than the Blues, who have offered a one-plus-one-year contract deal.  The Catalan club are also in advanced negotiations with Andreas Christensen and believe they can beat Bayern Munich to his signature.  It comes after a complete impasse in talks between the west¬†London club and the Denmark international.

Felix says there's no chance of Atletico Madrid exit amid Premier League transfer links,"Atletico Madrid star Joao Felix insists that he is committed to his La Liga club despite rumours linking him with a move to England.  Premier League duo Arsenal and Tottenham are both reportedly considering a summer move for the Portugal international, who enjoyed an impressive 2021-22 before injury brought an early end to his campaign. But Felix wants to stay with Diego Simeone at the Wanda Metropolitano and affirms that a departure this summer is not an option.  ""An exit from Atletico is not on the table,"" the 22-year-old explained to reporters from his native Portugal.  ""I am calm about my future, and aware of what I can do, I feel good about myself. ""I am still on holiday, I have just started training to prepare pre-season but I'm not thinking about football too much."" Felix came through the ranks at Benfica as a teenager and earned a move to Atletico in 2019 after smashing 20 goals in 43 games during his debut season at the Portuguese giants.  While he is yet to return those numbers in Spain, he has proved a valuable first-teamer for Simeone, able to play at centre-forward, just behind the lead striker or on either flank, while showing a consistent improvement over his three years at the club to date.  Felix's talents have also seen him break into the Portugal team, where he has scored three times in 22 appearances.  Simeone is considering a move for Arsenal outcast Hector Bellerin, though he faces competition from Real Betis among other clubs.

Ronaldo's stern message to Man Utd: I don't accept anything less than top three,"Cristiano Ronaldo has warned those around him at Manchester United that he will not accept anything less than a top-three standing this season, with a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner pointing out that he is not about to settle for ‚Äúsixth place or seventh place‚Äù. A modern day superstar has grown accustomed to competing for major honours over the course of an illustrious career that has delivered trophy triumphs aplenty in England, Spain and Italy. The Portuguese icon will be turning 37 on February 5, with many starting to slow down by this point, but ambition burns as bright as ever for an all-time great and he is urging his team-mates at Old Trafford to raise collective standards in what has been an inconsistent 2021-22 campaign. With United currently sat seventh in the Premier League table, six points adrift of the top four but boasting games in hand, Ronaldo has told Sky Sports: ""I don't accept that our mentality be less than being in the top three in the Premier League. ""I think to build up good things, sometimes you have to destroy a few things. So why not - new year, new life and I hope that Manchester [United] can be the level that the fans want. They deserve that. ""We are capable of changing things now. I know the way but I'm not going to mention it here because I don't think it's ethical on my part to say that. ""What I can say is we can do better - all of us. Manchester [United] belongs to important things, so we have to change that. ""I don't want to be here to be in sixth place, or seventh place, or fifth place. I'm here to try to win, to compete. ""I think we compete but we are not yet in our best level. But we have a long way to improve and I believe if we change our mind, we can achieve big things."" Part of the problem for United is that the current campaign has delivered more change on and off the field, with continuity and stability proving hard to come by. Alongside the fresh faces snapped up last summer, Ralf Rangnick has taken over managerial duties on an interim basis following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Asked about the impact of coaching tweaks on efforts to build momentum, Ronaldo added: ""Not easy to be honest. We changed Ole, then [Michael] Carrick [caretaker manager], then this new coach. It's difficult when you change so much, it's always tough. ""It's always sad and tough. Ole used to play with me before and now he was the coach. A fantastic person. When he left everybody was sad, but it's part of football. ""When things don't go the way the club wants, the club has to change. I was disappointed but we have to understand the club. It was difficult but life continues. ""But I still believe that we are capable of doing a good season. We know it's going to take time to make the ideas of the new coach on the pitch. ""But I'm looking forward. We have to work hard, we have to be together as players. We know we are not in the best moment, but I believe with working hard we can achieve important things, even this year."" The Portuguese missed United's 1-0 win over Aston Villa in the FA Cup but says that he hopes to be back in time for the Premier League clash against the same opponents on January 15. ""I'm good,"" he told Premier League Productions. ""I just have a little touch but, you know, it's part of my work. ""You know, we have to feel some pain sometimes. It's nothing big and I hope to be good soon. ""I hope so (that he'll be able to play against Villa). We will try on Thursday. I will try to train as normal. Let's see how the body reacts. Fingers crossed. I'm confident.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-stern-message-man-utd-accept-less-top-three/blt9f0ddfd386fd129b,Chris Burton,394f5aa1-9bad-46b1-8d4f-6104d1bcd9c2
Allegri reveals overnight Real Madrid U-turn after signing contract as he decided to join Juventus instead,"Massimiliano Allegri has revealed that he signed a contract with Real Madrid to become their next manager, only to make an overnight U-turn on a decision that ultimately paved the way for him to return to Juventus. The Italian tactician agreed to head back to Turin for a second spell with the Bianconeri in May 2021, having previously guided Serie A heavyweights to five domestic title triumphs and two Champions League finals. His career path could, however, have been markedly different had he honoured an agreement with La Liga giants that barely saw his signature dry before said paperwork was ripped up. Discussing his links to Real, who had been in the market for a successor to Zinedine Zidane before settling on the familiar figure of Carlo Ancelotti, Allegri told GQ: ‚ÄúI had already signed an agreement with Real Madrid. ‚ÄúThen in the morning I called the president [Florentino Perez] and told him that I would not go because I had chosen Juventus. He thanked me. Since Juventus called me in May I have had no doubts.‚Äù He added on snubbing the Blancos for a second time in his coaching career: ‚ÄúOn a professional level [to become Real Madrid boss] it would have been the culmination of a path, of course: Milan, Juve, Real. ‚ÄúBut in your life you can't always have everything and I'm really happy and proud to have coached Milan for four years and now to be in my sixth year in a club like Juventus. ‚ÄúI said no to Real Madrid twice. The first time was while I was talking about a renewal with Juve - I told the Real Madrid president that I had already given my word to Andrea Agnelli.‚Äù In his absence, Real have made their way to the top of the Liga table and through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Juve bowed out of Europe at the last-16 stage against Villarreal, are seven points off the pace in Serie A and hold a narrow lead over Fiorentina in their Coppa Italia semi-final. Success is not proving as easy to come by for Allegri as it did during his first stint in Turin, but he is looking to embrace those challenges while returning an ambitious outfit to the top of domestic and continental games. Quizzed on whether Juve are a different club now to the one he left in 2019, the 54-year-old said: ‚ÄúIt is. And it is a nice, interesting challenge that I am lucky enough to face alongside owners that have always been the same, and that, like me, want to win again. ‚ÄúWhen I first arrived in 2014 it was all different; Antonio Conte had done a great job with the club, winning three championships and building a very strong team that only needed to be refined. ‚ÄúThis year is a very different team with many young players, with strong players that have less experience. But we are starting from a clear base, which is the DNA of Juventus, and which consists of returning to winning ways but knowing how to suffer and always want to fight.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/allegri-overnight-u-turn-signing-real-madrid-contract/blt41f62961ffafd4b4,Chris Burton,50673a39-2b79-49ed-b5f2-f44119231980
"Pulisic, McKennie and Adams start but Robinson steals show as USMNT move closer to Qatar with El Salvador triumph","Thursday night's World Cup qualifier was the first time in three years that Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams all started together. Gregg Berhalter's big guns, the three true pillars of this young USMNT, were together again, offering a glimpse into what this team can look like at full strength. But it wasn't McKennie, Adams or Pulisic that was made the real difference on Thursday night in a far-from-sexy win over El Salvador. Rather it was the team's go-to left back, a player that has solidified his spot as first-choice just as much as any of those three USMNT pillars. Antonee Robinson scored the UMSNT's lone goal on Thursday, leading the way in a 1-0 win over El Salvador in chilly Columbus. The win keeps the U.S. in pole position to qualify for the World Cup, moving it one step closer to solidifying their spot in Qatar without too big of a sweat. The goal came after yet another frustrating first half, a real reason for concern for the USMNT and Berhalter. Playing against an El Salvador team that is much, much better than most give them credit for, the U.S. was frustrated, both in terms of on-field play and in-head emotion, as the squad struggled to break El Salvador's back line down. The bad news? The U.S. has now gone scoreless in the first half in seven of their nine World Cup qualifiers. The good news? The group tends to find igs way in the second half. The Stars and Stripes did just that on Thursday, with Robinson's 52nd-minute goal easing any doubts before they had a chance to set in. It came as the result of a strong run from Tim Weah and some pure effort from Jesus Ferreira, the latter of whom squandered a pair of early chances after being handed the start ahead of Ricardo Pepi. But, on this sequence, Ferreira made the difference, flicking on a pass towards Robinson, who rifled home his second career USMNT goal. And, much like his first, he celebrated with a now-trademark backflip as he pushed the U.S. into the lead. aaaaannnndddd.... we're flippin'ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è @antonee_jedi ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/8tiyj37Zof It was a deserved goal for a player who has truly made the left back position his over the last few months with his play for both club and country. At Fulham, Robinson, who has been linked to West Ham in recent weeks, has been a key figure in the club's promotion push. Fulham have been decimating all in their way in the Championship as they sit first in the league. Since the start of the year, they've won each of their four games in the league by a combined score of 22-6 with Robinson providing a goal and two assists during that span. With the U.S., Robinson has started five of the team's last six qualifiers, all but putting to rest the idea of inverting Sergino Dest to free up the logjam on the right. Sam Vines, George Bello and Joe Scally are all young players still in the mix, but the left back spot truly is Robinson's, something Berhalter admitted in the lead-up to Thursday's match. ""Antonee Robinson, it's a great story,"" Berhalter said. ""The story's about a guy who doesn't make  the Gold Cup team, and I say all the time just because you don't make one roster doesn't determine your status with the team indefinitely...Antonee is a guy who clawed his way back into it and is the clear starter at left-back.  ""He's done a great job with his club. They're in great form. He's scoring goals. He's relentless attacking, and he's done a good job with us. He's had assists and goals in qualifiers and been rock steady back there."" pic.twitter.com/7XvkWBrOtY He wasn't the only rock steady presence for the USMNT on Thursday. McKennie, in the form of his life with Juventus, was fantastic once again, marshaling the U.S. midfield. Weah showed dangerous flashes, making his own case for a spot in a crowded winger position. But, as the U.S. squad continues to take shape, Robinson has given Berhalter one less thing to worry about.  With spots still up for grabs in central defense, on the wing, in goal and up top, there's no doubt who the USMNT's starting left back is. Like Pulisic, McKennie and Adams, Robinson is a penciled-in, full-time USMNT starter and, on Thursday night, he helped the U.S. inch their closer to its end goal.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-pulisic-mckennie-adams-start-robinson-steals-show/blt556e002b07affe30,Ryan Tolmich,20479ea2-5ee9-476a-87bb-4840cfa1f665
Conor McGregor confirms intention to buy a football club amid Chelsea sale,"Conor McGregor has confirmed his intention to buy a football club amid the ongoing sale of Chelsea. Roman Abramovich officially put Chelsea up for sale on March 2, having initially passed on ""stewardship"" of the club to trustees following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Blues are now fielding interest from a number of parties, including McGregor, who has also hinted at trying to buy Manchester United and Celtic in the past. The two-division UFC world champion said he wished to explore the purchase of Chelsea after Abramovich's announcement and tweeted that he had submitted a ¬£1.5 billion bid for the club on Friday. McGregor has taken to social media once again to reiterate his desire to own a football club, but he is not putting all his eggs in the Blues' basket. ""I do not speak in jest. I am exploring this, as I said. Celtic from Dermot Desmond, Manchester United from the Glaziers (sic), and now the recently up for sale Chelsea football club,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""All being explored. A football franchise purchase is in my future make no mistake about it. ""Everyday I ball. How wouldn‚Äôt I lead a team of young, dedicated athletes to glory. I‚Äôm perfect for the job. Pray it‚Äôs your team."" A US-Swiss consortium led by Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss are thought to be leading the race to buy Chelsea, who have set a deadline of March 15 for all offers to be submitted. However, McGregor's bid is also on the table and AB Grup chairman Muhsin Bayrak has emerged as a candidate in recent days. Bayrak has confirmed that negotiations with Abramovich's legal team are already underway, with the Turkish businessman eager to ""fly the Turkish flag in London"" after submitting a formal offer. ‚ÄúYes, we definitely confirm [our offer].

'Football is cut-throat' - How Liverpool are helping former youth-team prospects become 'Cyber Stars',"A well-timed run and a perfectly-weighted through ball. A quick look up before a slick, right-foot finish inside the near post. A punch of the air and a smile that could have lit up all of Dublin. Jack Dunn remembers the moment as if it were yesterday, and why wouldn‚Äôt he? It may not have been the most significant goal ever scored ‚Äì the fourth in a sleepy, end-of-season friendly win over Shamrock Rovers at the Aviva Stadium ‚Äì but to a boyhood Liverpool fan it was everything. ‚ÄúI was living the dream,‚Äù Dunn tells GOAL now, more than eight years on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd been at Liverpool since I was seven, and all I‚Äôd ever dreamed of was playing and scoring for the first team. When it happened, it felt like the whole world was there for me.‚Äù At that time, Dunn was tipped as a potential star for both club and country. A technically-gifted, left-footed forward, he shone for Liverpool at youth level, and played alongside the likes of Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Jordan Pickford, Eric Dier and Patrick Bamford with England‚Äôs U17 and U19 sides. In 2011, he played at the U17 World Cup in Mexico, but despite showing promise in loan spells at Cheltenham, Burton Albion and Morecambe, he would never play a competitive senior game for Liverpool, and his professional career would be over at the age of 24.  These days, he works full-time as an online personal trainer while playing for Marine in the Northern Premier League, the seventh tier of the English pyramid.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying it,‚Äù he says, but that hasn‚Äôt always been the case. For a long time, he admits, football was anything but fun. Dunn‚Äôs story is a common one: the dedication and the dreams of a young man, the disappointment of rejection, the difficulty accepting your fate and then the dread of starting a new life. Recent figures show that only 0.01 per cent of the 1.5 million players who play organised youth football in England will make it to the Premier League, meaning the onus is on clubs to provide support, pathways and aftercare for those who fall short. Liverpool, it must be said, have become something of a standard-bearer in that respect. While much of the focus is on those who do make it at Anfield, such as Trent Alexander-Arnold or Curtis Jones, the Reds‚Äô real success stories can be found far and wide, and not just in professional football. Dunn, for example, is one of three former Liverpool prospects to have recently completed the first PSM ‚ÄòCyber Stars‚Äô Digital Academy programme, an initiative aimed specifically at helping current and ex-players into a career in the cybersecurity industry.¬† ‚ÄúIt all came from [Liverpool‚Äôs former head of education and welfare] Phil Roscoe,‚Äù he explains.¬† ‚ÄúHe started up an ‚Äòalumni‚Äô email, which goes out to ex players every quarter, and he and [education manager] Caitlin Hawkins, always keep in touch with us all, and are really helpful in pointing us towards different courses and opportunities.¬† ‚ÄúIt (cybersecurity and technology) is something I‚Äôve always been interested in, so when I saw this programme on the email, I jumped at it.‚Äù The ‚ÄòCyber Stars‚Äô course, Dunn admits, was challenging, consisting of five months‚Äô intense online training. Not easy when juggling a full-time job, a semi-professional football career and, most importantly, a young family too. Complete it he did, though. He, together with fellow ex-Reds Josh Sumner and Josh Dobie, attended a graduation ceremony at the AXA Training Centre in Kirkby last week, where they were presented with their qualifications by former Liverpool stars John Barnes and Michael Thomas. Breaking NewsWe are proud to announce that our first cohort have graduated from our Cyber Stars Programme at Liverpool FC. Congratulations to all our graduates! A huge thank you to @thinkbitgroup @CompTIA @hackthebox_eu and @LFC for supporting this project. #cybersecurity pic.twitter.com/DqoMKQ210f ‚ÄúIt's a much more well-rounded industry now in terms of taking into consideration 'the human being' as opposed to 'the player',‚Äù says Barnes.  ‚ÄúWhereas years ago, the footballers were the ones clubs cared about and took care of, but if you didn't make it, you were left on your own.¬† ""Years ago, when I was at a club, if you didn't make it, there was nothing else you could do. And while this may be a cyber security opportunity specifically, there may be other opportunities to go into further education as well, so it is a great thing.‚Äù Dobie, who played alongside Alexander-Arnold as a teenager and now works full-time at the Ashworth high security psychiatric hospital in Maghull, as well doing some part-time scouting for Liverpool at youth level, is certainly grateful for the opportunity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a blessing, to be honest,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe support from the club, especially Phil and Caitlin, has been brilliant. It‚Äôs just good to know that they are still interested in their former players.‚Äù After leaving Liverpool at 18, Dobie admits he ‚Äúmassively fell out of love‚Äù with football. He tells a familiar tale, one of dropping down the levels and finding it hard to adjust.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a kid, and you‚Äôre getting elbowed and kicked by all these old fellas,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúYou want to play out from the back and you can‚Äôt do that.  ""And because you‚Äôve been at Liverpool, you‚Äôre a target as well. People expect things from you, and it‚Äôs hard to get your head around.‚Äù Thankfully, the love has returned in recent years. Dobie played for Prescot Cables last season and would like to find a club again this term, if his schedule permits. Dunn has signed permanently at Marine, while Sumner, a midfielder who spent 10 years at Liverpool before being released in 2012, is one of the stars of the competitive Sunday League scene on Merseyside, regularly contributing spectacular goals for AFC Bull, many of which have been captured by the brilliant @MOTJGOALS Twitter account. Amazing vision and finish by the brilliant @joshsumner94 to put @AfcBull 1-3 up against @thecampfieldfc in the @BusinessHouses2 earlier today!#bestsundayleagueintheland pic.twitter.com/KzkjXZTPfS All three speak about the dangers of pursuing a career in professional football, and the pitfalls which await those who don‚Äôt consider, or prepare for, the worst-case scenario. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a bubble,‚Äù Sumner, who now works as a mechanic, says. ""You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever gonna end, but it can end quickly, trust me.‚Äù Dunn can certainly relate to that. ‚ÄúWhen I was young, I was blinkered,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere was no doubt in my head that I was going to make it. I was progressing through the age groups, doing well, playing a year up, training with the first team.¬† ‚ÄúIt never crossed my mind that I could be let go.‚Äù The message from all three is clear: think about the future, have a backup plan, learn and pick up skills that can help you, however your career eventually turns out. ‚ÄúFootball is ruthless, cut-throat,‚Äù says Dobie. ‚ÄúYou always have to have a Plan B.  ""I tell my little brother Zach that now. He‚Äôs in a similar situation to me, but I tell him to always have something in the back of his mind in case the worst happens.‚Äù Dunn nods his head in agreement. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see any other avenue,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere was no back-up plan. ‚ÄúThen, when I was playing semi-professional and working as a PT, the pandemic came and all of a sudden the football stopped and the gyms closed!  ""So, that‚Äôs two sources of income stopping abruptly, and as a new father that was just‚Ä¶wow!‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúWhat I would always say to any young player is to learn as many skills as you can, give yourself as many opportunities as you can, because you never know. You think it‚Äôs going to last forever, football, but it doesn‚Äôt.

Pepi to Augsburg: What USMNT star's move means for 2022 and beyond,"The months-long saga over Ricardo Pepi's future came down to one late twist, and it will no doubt have lasting ramifications for the U.S. men's national team (USMNT) in the months and years to come. Linked to Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Real Madrid and just about every other major club, Pepi's next step will instead come at Augsburg, who broke the bank to sign the highly-rated American prospect. Augsburg have forked over a club-record fee for the now-former FC Dallas star, reportedly $20 million (¬£15m/‚Ç¨18m) plus add ons, putting Pepi right into the Miguel Almiron and Alphonso Davies stratosphere of MLS sales. It's one of the biggest moves in American soccer history, both financially and in importance. The price tag is significant for a player who, less than 12 months ago, was a totally unproven youngster that looked years away from his big move. That big move is here, and it's one with many layers that impact the 18-year-old star's immediate and long-term future. Over the last few months, since emerging as American soccer's brightest young star and the USMNT's No 9 of the present and future, Pepi has made no secret of his long-term goals. He's spoken openly about his desire to some day play for Madrid, to reach the highest levels of the game, to prove himself one of the best of the best. So, in that sense, his move to Augsburg is somewhat of a surprise. Until just days ago, Augsburg weren't even on the radar. Wolfsburg appeared to be the team in pole position and Pepi seemingly had a big, but manageable, jump lined up. Wolfsburg are a Champions League team, but not a Champions League contender. He wouldn't be competing against Robert Lewandowski or Karim Benzema for minutes, but he would be playing against them on Europe's biggest stage. Yet in swooped Augsburg at seemingly the last minute, offering FC Dallas a much larger financial package and Pepi a much different challenge. At Wolfsburg, Pepi could have quickly become a key piece if he proved himself. At Augsburg, he will have to be. Now arriving in Augsburg: Ricardo Pepi üöÇ pic.twitter.com/pLVjFK5RNN Augsburg currently sit just one point above the relegation playoff spot, having scored just 17 goals in as many games. They're far from a Bundesliga power or a Champions League contender. They just spent a record fee to bring in Pepi. They didn't just do that for Pepi's future, which obviously remains bright. They also did that for Pepi's present, as they believe that he is the player that will fire them to safety and beyond. When you're a club like Augsburg, you don't spend that much money on a striker that won't save you this season. That's just one aspect. The second is what this means for Pepi and the USMNT in general. At Augsburg, Pepi will be given every chance to succeed. He will not be benched after a few bad games or cast aside for a shiny new signing in six months. The club is committing to him in a big way, and that's a good sign - but there is still reason for concern, and one only needs to look at another USMNT striker to understand that. Josh Sargent found himself at a similar level at Werder Bremen, but struggled to truly emerge as a goalscorer for what was a truly bad team. He then moved to Norwich and, so far, has learned that the grass isn't always greener, even if the bad team you now play for is in the Premier League. The good news for Pepi is that the underlying numbers with Augsburg offer reason for hope. They have the eighth-best possession percentage in the league and generate the sixth-most shots per game. From those numbers, it's quite clear that they just need a goalscorer, and Pepi is that in the purest form. Pepi isn't overly fast, strong or tricky, but he is a real scorer. He puts himself in positions to do damage, and he's complete enough in every aspect of the game to threaten most defenders. In that sense, it's very possible that Pepi is that missing piece, the one that turns that possession and those chances into the goals that save their season. As always, there's risk. This is a World Cup year, after all and, for the USMNT to be the team they want to be at the World Cup, they'll need a No 9. Pepi so far has been that No 9, scoring three times in his seven appearances, but he's still young, still growing, still learning, and the USMNT will need Pepi to keep doing those things if he's to be who they need him to be in Qatar. The U.S. do have a backup plan, in the form of another player who recently made a big move of his own. His stock has fallen a bit in the last six months, as fatigue seemingly caught up to him, but Daryl Dike certainly still has a part to play in this race. His move to West Brom gives him a chance to regain ground in this race, which also includes Sargent, Jordan Pefok and Matthew Hoppe, just to name a few. There's no perfect science when it comes to making the leap from MLS to Europe, no true roadmap that can pinpoint what's right and wrong. That line, the one that determines success or failure, is often so fine, especially at the top levels of European soccer where competition is fierce and the level is very high. Over the next 12 months, we'll learn a lot about Pepi's decision, and perhaps even more about the young striker himself. We'll learn just how good he can be, how many goals he can score, how well he can handle the pressures that come with a big-money move.  His first big-money move is now behind him, but there's a long road ahead for a player who is, and will remain, the talk of American soccer.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ricardo-pepi-augsburg-usmnt-star/bltb0d18bbc66547dc7,Ryan Tolmich,b01902bb-6cfa-483a-9f3f-ba020e38fe99
Manchester City interested in River Plate striker Alvarez,"Manchester City are considering a move for River Plate forward Julian Alvarez, GOAL can confirm.  The 21-year-old Argentina international is understood to have a release clause in his contract set at around ¬£17million ($23m).  City have been without a striker all season after missing out on Tottenham's Harry Kane in the summer, but he is unlikely to go straight into Pep Guardiola's side this season with the coach keen on signing a front-line forward in the summer.  River are keen to keep him for the next six months and he could then be loaned out to a sister club within the City Football Group.  A former Real Madrid youth player, Alvarez scored 18 goals in 21 appearances in the Argentinian top-flight last season. He is one of Argentina‚Äôs most promising young players, making five appearances for the national team in World Cup qualifiers and Copa America.  He was with the Madrid academy for two years, but was unable sign for them as he was under 13.  Madrid have been linked with a return for the forward and he has been as a potential target for a host of European giants including Manchester United and Barcelona.  After returning to Argentina with River Plate, he made his professional debut in 2018 and has 36 goals in 96 appearances.  Relatively small and with a low centre of gravity, Alvarez has drawn comparisons with fellow Argentinian and City's record goalscorer Sergio Aguero but he also has the ability to play anywhere across the front three.  ‚ÄúPlaying in Europe is most people's dream because of those leagues' quality and what it means to be at those clubs,‚Äù Alvarez told Radio La Red in 2020.  ‚ÄúI am taking it easy. Obviously I talk to my agent and my family, but I know I have to stay focused on what I'm doing.  Later the time will come, through the work I am doing. On the Playstation, I play with Barcelona or Manchester City.‚Äù  Meanwhile, River Plate president Jorge Brito has all but confirmed that Alvarez will leave the club this year, albeit without naming City directly.""If you look at everything that Julian has done, it was always likely that someone would pay his release clause,"" Brito has told ESPN. ""The most difficult thing was to keep him on loan, as he is almost irreplaceable for Marcelo [Gallardo] and the squad.  ""Contractually, even though the loan is until July 7, there is a clause that as long as River continues in the Copa Libertadores, he will stay with us.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-city-river-plate-alvarez/blt86f2473f42a803c8,Jonathan Smith,03d903a2-9ac4-425f-80a2-61a49edfce0d

Robertson: Scotland have to be ready for the challenge and emotion of Ukraine,"Andrew Robertson has warned Scotland ""have to be ready for the challenge and emotion Ukraine will provide"" when the two teams meet in their 2022 World Cup qualifying semi-final playoff this week. The semi-final clash had originally been scheduled three months earlier, but was pushed back as a result of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of civilians have died in the conflict already while many more have been forced to flee the country, and Robertson has expressed his ""sympathy"" towards those affected. However, the Liverpool star says Scotland have to try and stay focused on the task at hand when the Ukraine national team arrive at Hampden Park on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe have huge sympathy for the people of Ukraine, of course we do,‚Äù Robertson told The Guardian. ""I think it‚Äôs fair to say everyone at the Scottish FA and in this team has stood behind them from the start.  ""What we have seen there is horrendous. For 90 minutes or 120 minutes, we need to separate our thoughts. We want to get to the World Cup, we have to be ready for the challenge and emotion Ukraine will provide."" Scotland are now just two wins away from reaching their first World Cup since 1998, with Steve Clarke having overseen a significant turnaround in fortunes since replacing Alex McLeish in May 2019. Clarke's team have bounced back after a disappointing showing at last summer's European Championships, and Robertson is excited about what the future holds under his stewardship. ‚ÄúHe has made us believe,‚Äù he said of his national team boss. ‚ÄúHe has made us believe that we are a good team. I believe with the players we have, the standard we play at [domestically] is high but it was always about bringing that together into a team. Sometimes we didn‚Äôt have the balance quite right; the formation, the tactics. ‚ÄúThe gaffer and his staff have been a breath of fresh air.

How will Ronaldo have reacted to Man Utd benching? Ferdinand says Portuguese superstar will be 'absolutely fuming',"WHAT HAPPENED? A five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner, who has spent much of the summer generating talk of a move being made elsewhere, has been named among the substitutes for the Red Devils‚Äô last two Premier League games. Having hit 24 goals last season, and with ambition continuing to burn bright, an all-time great is not expected to have taken his snub lightly. WHAT THEY SAID: Ferdinand, who enjoyed Premier League and Champions League successes alongside Ronaldo at Old Trafford, has told his Vibe with Five YouTube channel: ‚ÄúWhether he stays or not none of us know, but knowing Cristiano, I know for a fact that he will be absolutely fuming right now. Forget who‚Äôs starting in front of him, it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs not starting. You don‚Äôt get to do what he‚Äôs done in his career over this amazing amount of time at the levels he‚Äôs been playing and be someone who‚Äôs going to accept not starting and being a sub for a team that‚Äôs not in the Champions League. ‚ÄúCristiano Ronaldo, no matter what anyone says about running, pressing etc, he‚Äôll be sitting there going ‚ÄòI scored 24 goals last year, talk to me‚Äô how many times did anybody else get near that in this team?

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 20+ club goals in 16 consecutive seasons in all competitions. WHAT NEXT FOR RONALDO?

'Maybe he wants to work at Man Utd' - Man City boss Guardiola hits back at Evra over PlayStation comments,"Pep Guardiola has hit back at Patrice's Evra's comments that his management style makes players feel like they are stripped of autonomy and commanded as if in a Playstation game, with the Spaniard suggesting his jibe is an attempt to get a job at rivals Manchester United. The former Red Devils favourite praised the Citizens boss earlier this week while admitting he was glad to have never played under him and his micromanagement style during his career. Now, Guardiola has fired back, and suggests that the Frenchman's words are intended to offer some tactical analysis in search of a job at his old club, while pointing to the calibre of players he has possessed over the years. ""I don‚Äôt want personality? Well. I don‚Äôt agree, Patrice!"" Guardiola stated. ""I don‚Äôt play. I need personalities and good players to play on the pitch. Otherwise, we wouldn't [be here]. ""I didn‚Äôt read it or know [what he‚Äôs said]. I have had nice, incredible players in my past as a manager at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and here.

Do World Cup hosts automatically qualify for the tournament? ,"It is a rare privilege in hosting a World Cup tournament, with thousands from around the world descending on the country and partaking in its culture and sights. Hosting a World Cup tournament also comes with the right to automatically qualify ‚Äì so how does that work, and what happens when there are multiple hosts to a competition? GOAL has what you need to know and more. From the 1938 World Cup going forwards, every host nation has automatically qualified for the tournament. The host nation is the first country to qualify for the tournament, and they are not required to play qualification matches. This is an obvious advantage to smaller countries who typically wouldn't have a great chance in qualifying for the World Cup through the traditional qualification means, like Qatar (who are hosting World Cup 2022). South Korea and Japan both automatically qualified as hosts when they were awarded hosting rights to the 2002 World Cup. This, however, was the last time that more than one country automatically qualified as hosts of a World Cup. The 2026 World Cup will see the United States, Mexico and Canada all co-hosting the tournament, but FIFA has not yet confirmed the qualification process ‚Äì and so it is still unknown if all three will be awarded automatic hosting rights. The 2026 edition will be the first to include 48 teams, expanded from 32, so it is possible that all three host nations qualify automatically ‚Äì but this has yet to be confirmed. This would be a major boost for Canada, who last qualified for a World Cup tournament in 1986, while the United States Men's National Team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Defending World Cup champions were given the right to automatically qualify for the next competition between 1938 and 2002, but this rule was discarded from the 2006 World Cup onward, when reigning champion Brazil had to qualify through the traditional process.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/do-world-cup-hosts-automatically-qualify-for-the-tournament/blt550ef68c6581844b,Cady Siregar,a62c6b4d-2e26-4d44-9941-1efab1d2d613
'McKennie lives in a different world!' - De Ligt singles out USMNT star as funniest Juventus player while hailing midfielder's improvement,"Matthijs de Ligt singled out Weston McKennie as Juventus' funniest player, saying that the American midfielder lives ""in a completely different world"" than the rest of his team-mates. McKennie is currently out injured, but recently said he hopes to be back fully fit within the next few weeks, giving him an outside chance of featuring for Juve before the end of the season. De Ligt, surely, would welcome him back, as he says McKennie has made himself a vital piece of the team on and off the field. ""I think McKennie,"" De Ligt said when asked by CBS who the funniest Juve player is. ""Weston, he lives in a completely different world than us. It's so funny to see.  ""He's from America, of course, and I think he made a big, big improvement in his game with us. In the team, he's such a funny guy and he's really important."" McKennie has certainly shown his personality since arriving at Juventus from Schalke in 2020.

The Figo Affair: Netflix's deep dive documentary about controversial Barcelona - Real Madrid transfer,"Luis Figo once found himself at the centre of one of the most controversial transfers football had ever seen, and a remarkable agreement that took him from Barcelona to Real Madrid is set to become the subject of a Netflix documentary. El Caso Figo, or The Figo Affair, will offer unique insight into how a stunning deal was done and why it caused such a fuss. Plenty of football followers, from Portugal to Catalunya, will be eager to catch a glimpse of what promises to be an intriguing tale, with GOAL on hand to deliver all of the information you need to get in on that act. Back in July 2000, with Portugal international winger Figo having spent five years on the books at Barcelona, Real Madrid and their Galactico-hungry president Florentino Perez agreed to trigger a buyout clause that existed in a contract completed by their fiercest rivals. The Blancos made it known that they would be willing to pay ‚Ç¨62 million (¬£53m/$62m) ‚Äì a world record fee at the time ‚Äì for a proven performer in La Liga that they believed could make a telling contribution at Santiago Bernabeu. Barca supporters felt betrayed by a player they had welcomed into their hearts, as he crossed a fierce Clasico divide in Spanish football, and Figo quickly morphed from hero to villain in the eyes of those at Camp Nou. He was mercilessly taunted during any subsequent outings against the Blaugrana, with a first return to Catalunya in October 2000 seeing Figo become a target for banners and missiles from the stands. His most infamous retracing of steps to Barcelona came a year later, though, in November 2002 when, as projectiles once again rained down on him from the terraces, a pig‚Äôs head was thrown in his direction as he prepared to take a corner. Some 20 years on from a transfer that sent shock waves around the world, Netflix has gained access to the men that made a move possible and found themselves filling prominent roles in a thrilling sporting soap opera. The documentary will also dive into the business of backroom deals, a historic and passionate rivalry that is shaped by a deep cultural divide and, of course, that pig‚Äôs head. The Figo Affair will be made available to stream on Netflix from August 25, 2022. The documentary has been made by David Tryhorn and Ben Nicholas, who are best known for their work on the biographical film ‚ÄòPele‚Äô from 2021. Tryhorn has said of turning attention towards another all-time great: ""After the success of Pele, Ben and I were delighted to partner with Netflix again on El Caso Figo. ""It‚Äôs increasingly hard to find sports documentaries that are saying something new, that aren‚Äôt simply biographies or histories of sporting successes, so we believe El Caso Figo is unique. ""Focusing on the transfer rather than Figo‚Äôs career, the film informs us about truth, greed, morality, and the inner workings of the world‚Äôs most popular sport. ""We were delighted that all those involved in the deal were willing to participate in full. Everyone, from Florentino Perez to Pep Guardiola, was generous with their time but Luis Figo was particularly accommodating, desperate as he was to finally set the record straight after two decades of avoiding the question of his transfer."" The Figo Affair will be released exclusively on the Netflix streaming service. It is a Spanish language production, but will be made available to a global audience with subtitles. A basic Netflix subscription in the United Kingdom costs ¬£6.99 per month, rising to ¬£15.99 for the premium package, while that translates to $9.99 and $19.99 respectively in the United States. You can watch the trailer for the documentary in the video above.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-figo-affair-netflix-documentary-controversial-barcelona-real-/blt386b726a87f223fe,Chris Burton,3493824e-e7b3-4d50-bd08-ce786efbb35c
Watch: Payet scores 25-yard Puskas Award-contending goal with thunderbolt half-volley for Marseille,"Dimitri Payet has always been a player that is capable of producing moments of jaw-dropping magic, and the Marseille star did just that during a Europa Conference League clash with PAOK as he fired in an early contender for the 2022 Puskas Award. Ligue 1 heavyweights were already leading 1-0 as half-time approached during a continental outing against Greek opposition, but the roof was taken off Stade Velodrome by a stunning volley from a mercurial France international. Former West Ham star Payet loitered on the edge of the box as Marseille lined up a corner in the 45th minute, with the ball fired into him as he spun on the spot and made a perfect connection with a 25-yard thunderbolt that scorched into the top corner.

Stade d‚ÄôOlembe will host Afcon final despite deadly stadium stampede,"The Africa Cup of Nations semi-final and final will both take place at the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe less than a fortnight after eight people lost their lives at a crush at the stadium. The Confederation of African Football confirmed on Sunday that, in light of assurances received by local authorities following a hearing into the causes of last Monday‚Äôs crush, there will be no venue change for Cameroon‚Äôs semi-final against Egypt nor the tournament final on January 6. As well as eight deaths, 38 people were injured‚Äîseven seriously‚Äîbefore Cameroon‚Äôs Last 16 meeting with Comoros, prompting Caf to take the quarter-final due to be held at Olembe away from the 60,000 stadium. While any further matches at the area were only to take place pending an investigation, a Caf statement issued on Sunday indicates that the organisation are content that there will be no repeat of the deadly scenes in the upcoming fixtures. ‚ÄúHaving noted the recommendations and undertakings from Government in regard to additional security provisions over and above those which were already successfully implemented at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium during the Morocco and Malawi match and at the Japoma Stadium during the Gambia and Cameroon match, the CAF Organising Committee unanimously agreed to lift the suspension imposed on the Olembe Stadium,‚Äù read a Caf statement as seen by GOAL. ‚ÄúCAF, the Local Organising Committee and the Government of Cameroon having significantly increased security and resources at the Olembe Stadium, are confident that the safety and security of spectators and visitors will be assured.‚Äù During a swathe of fixture changes announced earlier this week, Caf took one quarter-final away from Olembe, as well as removing a Last Eight tie and a semi-final away from the Stade Japoma in Douala. In light of the incident, CAF announced their own investigation into the crush, while Cameroon head of state Paul Biya also confirmed that the government would be examining the causes of the incident. Speaking on Friday, Sports Minister Narcisse Mouelle Kombi went into some more detail about the causes of the crush, blaming a ‚Äúmassive and late influx of supporters‚Äù while also indicating that ‚Äî as Caf President Dr Patrice Motsepe had suggested on Friday ‚Äî the closing of a stadium door ahead of the match also played a part. Stadiums at the Nations Cup have been capped at 60-percent capacity for matches, with an extra 20 percent permitted for Cameroon games. However, Kombi also indicated that close to 60,000 fans had attempted to enter the 60,000-capacity Olembe Stadium ahead of the Indomitable Lions' 2-1 victory over the Comoros as they reached the Last Eight. ‚ÄúThere was a gate that was closed that was meant to be open, and if it had been open, people would have walked through,‚Äù Motsepe told GOAL on Tuesday. ‚ÄúFor inexplicable reasons, it was closed. ‚ÄúIf it had been open, as it was supposed to, we wouldn‚Äôt have had the problem we have now‚Äîthis loss of life. ‚ÄúAs part of this hearing, we want to know who closed it and who is responsible, because we mustn‚Äôt compromise in our insistence to have appropriate measures which are the best in the world,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThere may be unforeseen circumstances when a gate that is supposed to be open is closed, but we and our partners, we have a huge commitment to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place so that this doesn‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù Barring further venue changes, Cameroon and Egypt will meet in the second semi-final at the Stade d‚ÄôOlembe on February 3, with Burkina Faso facing the winner of Senegal or Equatorial Guinea at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo the evening before.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/stade-d-olembe-will-host-afcon-final-despite-deadly-stadium/bltc7ca5515b3d73069,Ed Dove,1ae85e94-d02d-45c2-b957-1d5418a82862
Haaland only has himself to blame for transfer rumours and media circus,"At this stage, Erling Haaland should not be surprised by the questions he gets asked after matches: But when former Norway striker Jan Age Fjortoft used the opportunity to ask him about both topics after Haaland's double against Freiburg on Friday, the 21-year-old seemed annoyed by the line of questioning. ""The last six months, I have chosen not to say anything out of respect for Dortmund,"" Haaland told Viaplay. ""But now the club has started to pressure me into making a decision, but all I want to do is to play football. ""They press me to make a decision now about my future. So that means I have to make a decision soon. ""I have said from the beginning that I want to focus on football, because that is when I am at my best, not when other things come into my mind. ""Now they have put pressure for a while. So it is time to get things started. All I want to do is to play football, but I can't do that now."" If all Haaland wants to do is play football, though, he has gone the wrong way about doing it. His own decisions have led to this point - where all anyone inside and outside Borussia Dortmund is focused on is Haaland's future. When he was 17 and playing for Molde, Haaland visited Leeds with his father, Alf-Inge, to discuss a potential move to Elland Road. Molde wanted ¬£4 million for a player who would have joined the Leeds academy rather than the first team at the time, and West Yorkshire outfit decided not to gamble. Soon after, super agent Mino Raiola came on the scene and brokered the deal that took Haaland to Red Bull Salzburg. Raiola had a plan for the striker's career and that plan has worked splendidly so far, making Haaland into one of the most sought-after players in world football. But having someone like Raiola as an agent does not come without its drawbacks for Haaland. If the 21-year-old is annoyed at the media speculation regarding his future and the pressure he is feeling at Dortmund about making a decision, he only has himself and Raiola to blame. When Raiola talks to the media about Haaland's future, he is speaking on his client's behalf. So when he lists potential suitors for a summer 2022 transfer, that is only because that is something he has likely spoken to his client about too. ""He can and will take the next step,"" Raiola told Sport1 in December. ""Bayern, Real, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãCity - these are the big clubs he can go to. City has won the championship five times in recent years, significantly more than United. ""When we moved to Dortmund, we all knew that this step would come. Maybe this summer, maybe the summer after. But there is a great chance that Erling will leave this summer. We will see."" The language is telling: ""We all knew that this step would come."" How many #Bundesliga goals will @ErlingHaaland finish with this season? ‚ö´Ô∏èüü° pic.twitter.com/tQFvAoLVJL This transfer talk is not a shock for Haaland. It was part of the plan all along. The plan he signed up for when he appointed Raiola as his agent. In the same interview, Raiola said he actually likes it when sporting directors hate him. ‚ÄúI'm ready to go to war for my players. I am ready to do anything, as I would for my sons,"" he said. ‚ÄúThe sporting directors hate me? How come? I've never sat with a gun on the table in negotiations. I just know very well what value my players have and what the clubs need. ‚ÄúIf they hate me, then it's the biggest compliment for me. Then I'm doing something well. If they said ‚Äòit's good that the Raiola advises the player, it'll be easy for us,‚Äô then I'd have a problem.‚Äù Dortmund's directors don't hate Raiola, and they were glad to do a deal with him back in December 2019. But now they want clarity on the situation. The Bundesliga side want to convince Haaland to stay, doubling his contract and removing the transfer clause that would see him leave the club this summer. But time is running out for all parties. Raiola stands to make around ‚Ç¨20m in agent's fees if a transfer happens this summer. Dortmund are out of the Champions League this season and need to know if they can rely on Haaland to be around next year, or whether they should they start looking for a replacement. The person affected the least by this transfer talk is Haaland himself. He will play at a big club next season and be paid more money regardless of what happens. For now, he can keep scoring goals and let his agent do the talking for him off the pitch. That is what he signed up for.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/haaland-himself-blame-transfer-rumours-media-circus/bltf0c85f1410f1f97a,Ronan Murphy,40fc2a74-3e99-40e8-b34a-1a7fbd969cf3
'Bernardo does like Barcelona' - Guardiola addresses transfer rumours as Xavi confesses 'love' for Man City star,"WHAT HAPPENED?

'Still got a few tricks' - Fabregas says he 'felt good' in first game in seven months amid retirement reports,"Cesc Fabregas has shared footage of his return to the pitch with Monaco as the former Spain international continues to work his way back from injury. The former Arsenal and Barcelona star has been beset by issues this term, including a hamstring problem and a bout of coronavirus, seriously hampering his season. But, amid speculation over his retirement, he returned to action on Saturday by playing for Monaco's second team against Aubagne before being replaced. Taking to Twitter to showcase his return to the pitch, the former Chelsea midfielder showcased a video featuring his recognisable talents with a caption heralding his comeback.

But whether he will call time on his career remains to be seen. Though he has been plagued by injuries since arriving at Monaco, the 34-year-old's determination to continue means he could well have gas in the tank left. However, with a contract set to expire this summer, it may well be that he has to find a new club to finish his career with if he intends to prolong it.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fabregas-felt-good-first-game-seven-months-retirement/blt92f56054ad8458dd,Andrew Steel,56f2bf98-1bf1-4f48-a9f4-e897505b4fa2
Tuchel has 'no hard feelings' toward Conte after bust up but vents anger at referee Taylor,"Thomas Tuchel has insisted that there are ""no hard feelings"" between himself and Antonio Conte, despite the two managers clashing during Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Sunday. However, Tuchel was not so forgiving to referee Anthony Taylor, whom he hinted should be barred from officiating his side's games.  This weekend's London derby was one of the fiercest in recent memory with Tuchel and Conte both being sent off at full time.  Chelsea went ahead early on through home debutant Kalidou Koulibaly, before Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg netted a controversial second-half equaliser. Reece James then thought he had won it for the hosts, only for Harry Kane to pop up with a 96th minute header to earn Spurs a point.  After nibbling at each other all game, the two managers then went nose to nose after a heated post-match handshake, which earned them both a red card.   ""It's emotional, football. We don't need to heat it up. You have emotional coaches on the touchline and that's it. If we meet [later], we meet. If not, then not. Come on guys, it's between two competitors and nothing bad happened,"" Tuchel told Sky Sports. He later added to the BBC: ""It was hot from the temperature and hot between the benches and hot on the field and hot between the spectators - everything that you want and what you hope in a match like this early in the season.  ""It was a brilliant match and unfortunately we didn't get the win that we deserved.  ""There's no hard feelings [with Conte] - I feel like it was a fair tackle from him and a fair tackle from me. We did not insult each other, we did not hit each other, we were fighting for our teams and from my side there's absolutely no hard feelings. I'm surprised that we both got a red card for that."" Once again, Taylor was at the centre of several controversial decisions that cost Chelsea. In the lead up to Spurs' first goal, Kai Havertz appeared to be fouled by Rodrigo Bentancur, while Marc Cucurella had his hair pulled just before Kane netted his late equaliser.  Chelsea fans have been vocal in their criticism of Taylor in recent years, and Tuchel hinted that his players had begun to notice a trend of disappointing decisions too.  ""I don‚Äôt think just some of the fans think that. I can assure you the whole dressing room of us, every single person, thinks that,"" he said.  ""I can‚Äôt understand how the first goal is not offside and I can‚Äôt understand when a player is pulled by their hair, the other player stays on the pitch.  ""Pull someone else‚Äôs hair, stay on the pitch and attack the last corner. This is for me without any explanation and I don‚Äôt want to accept it. Both goals should not stand and it‚Äôs a fair result because we were brilliant, deserved to win. This is my point of view.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tuchel-has-no-hard-feelings-toward-conte-after-bust-up-but-vents-/blt2397de354bd4734b,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,d9ae1901-f7d7-4b76-94be-60ea21240824
Pogback! Can Man Utd flop really rescue his club career at Juventus?,"In July 2016, Massimiliano Allegri issued a warning that was clearly intended for Paul Pogba. ""Anyone who has the opportunity to leave Juventus has to consider things very carefully because, right now, Juve are among the top four European clubs,"" the Bianconeri boss stated. Sadly, that warning went unheeded. Even though Pogba's then-agent Mino Raiola had always insisted that his client would only leave Juve at the right time, for the ""right project"" and the ""right team"", he instead joined Jose Mourinho's Manchester United. Essentially, Raiola and Pogba could not have got the most important move of the midfielder's career more wrong. There were sentimental considerations, of course. Pogba hadn't really wanted to leave United for Juventus in 2012. He felt ""Mancunian"". He wanted to prove himself at Old Trafford. So, he was ""shocked"" by the way in which talks over a renewal collapsed, with Raiola and then-United manager Sir Alex Ferguson clashing during a decisive meeting over the midfielder's future. Raiola later admitted in an Amazon Prime documentary that he deemed United's offer derisory, telling Ferguson, ""For this money, my chihuahua would not walk on the grass of the training centre!"" The Scot's subsequent retirement thus facilitated Pogba's return four years later; but it also doomed it to failure.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/pogba-wasted-six-years-man-utd-juventus-another-disaster/blt028ffb5ee3eea4d1,Mark Doyle,d4d67cfa-3ae3-4952-9be1-8f23c22b5b3f
Calvin Ramsay: Scottish teenager earning Premier League and Serie A interest,"Calvin Ramsay is a Scottish full-back with a difference. With Andy Robertson established as one of the world‚Äôs finest left-backs at Liverpool, Kieran Tierney well on his way to joining him in that bracket at Arsenal, and Aaron Hickey impressing in Serie A with Bologna, it is clear there are an abundance of talented left-sided options at Steve Clarke's disposal. Ramsay, though, promises a similar standard of player on the right ‚Äì a role that has been a problem position for the international team for years. Having turned 18 right at the beginning of the 2021-22 season, Ramsay has gone from strength to strength in an Aberdeen side that has, on the whole, disappointed in the Premiership. His quality is underlined by the statistic that Ramsay, with eight assists in all competitions, is only eclipsed by three players in terms of teenage goal creators in top-flight European football this season: Bayer Leverkusen ace Florian Wirtz, Sparta Prague sensation Adam Hlozek and Borussia Dortmund wonderkid Jude Bellingham. Impressive company, indeed. Little wonder, then, that the scramble to sign the young Scot has been intense. Aberdeen are understood to have knocked back bids from Leeds United, Leicester City and Bologna already, while Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham have been keeping close tabs on a player who only made his senior debut in March 2021 in a Scottish Cup trip to Dumbarton. Ramsay‚Äôs most obvious qualities are those he provides going forwards. His distribution is excellent over a variety of ranges, he is a strong set-piece taker and his willingness to attack opposing defenders is more reminiscent of a winger than a full-back. He is also blessed with excellent ability on both feet. This was amply demonstrated as Aberdeen posted a tweet of him scoring a stunning 30-yard strike with his weaker left foot while playing for the youth team. A strong runner, he looks every inch the modern full-back, with a style reminiscent of those at the very top of the game, such as Trent Alexander-Arnold or Kyle Walker. There is a long way to go before he hits such heights, but the intent and desire is there. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ‚ÄúHis quality of delivery from set-pieces and open play has brought him plenty of assists for Aberdeen. For someone so young to come in and make the impact he has is a great credit to him,‚Äù former Dons boss Derek McInnes told The Scotsman. ‚ÄúWe had earmarked this season as his turn to make the breakthrough and he has taken these opportunities brilliantly.‚Äù Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack has also been particularly vocal over the quality of player that the club have on their hands, enthusing in December: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a lovely kid who looks after himself and has his feet on the ground. And he can use both feet! ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not many right-backs like him at that age doing what he does when you look at all the data. All these clubs look at the same systems. They will have seen the same things that we have: that he‚Äôs in the elite upper bracket for a young right-back in Europe. He's right up there across Europe, and they are seeing that.‚Äù Little wonder Aberdeen are proud of him. Ramsay joined the club as a nine-year-old and has emerged through their academy system to graduate to Scotland Under-21 honours ‚Äì skipping the step of playing for the U19s side along the way. Even before he had kicked a ball for the first team, he had also been given a major vote of confidence with a contract that runs until 2024. Videos have been posted on social media of the young Ramsay training with a ball wearing an Aberdeen shirt in his garden at just 13, showing footwork and a technical gift that many much older boys would be envious of. He is a player his coaches have earmarked for years, and thanks to his hard work, their efforts are being rewarded. As with many young players, though, Ramsay‚Äôs trajectory has not been linear. A hamstring injury suffered in October sent him to the sidelines for the best part of two months, and since he has returned, he has struggled to recapture the sparkling form he displayed in the early weeks of the season. Of course, the constant noise over his future has not helped ‚ÄúIt has definitely affected him a touch, I think anyone can see that,‚Äù manager Stephen Glass said. ‚ÄúI am not surprised it has affected him a little bit, being only 18 and the first time he has been through this.‚Äù During his time, the weaknesses in his game have become more apparent. He must bulk up physically before he is ready for the top level ‚Äì something that can be easily remedied by some hard work in the gym ‚Äì and he must work on his defensive attributes, particularly in terms of aerial duels and tackle success. Given the right coaching and mentorship, though, he has the capacity to make it all the way to the top of the game, and with the correct application and perhaps a little luck, there is no reason he cannot match the achievements of Robertson and Tierney in the Premier League.

International breaks 2021-22: When are they and what competitions are there?,"The international football calendar does not have a major end-of-season tournament to build up to for summer 2022, but there are plenty of fixtures arranged between the top national sides across the globe. Qualifying for the World Cup, which will take place in November/December 2022, is approaching a conclusion, with the UEFA play-offs set for March 2022. The Africa Cup of Nations will then take centre stage at the start of 2022, with some World Cup qualifiers scheduled to take place when that competition's knockout matches begin. The build-up to Qatar 2022 will reach its final stages in March, one month before the draw for the World Cup group stage. There are five international breaks planned for the 2021-22 season. This season's first set of international fixtures took place between August 30 and September 8, and were followed by the next break in club football that ran from October 4 to October 13.

Burkina Faso right-back Kabore named Afcon 2021 Best Young Player,"Manchester City loanee and Burkina Faso right-back Issa Kabore has been named the Best Young Player at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Although he did not score a goal in the tournament, Kabore played a key role in Burkina Faso's run to the last-four stage with his attacking and defensive contributions. The 20-year-old, currently on loan at Troyes, played every minute of the Stallions' matches in Cameroon and he contributed three assists. Burkina Faso played Cameroon in the third-place play-off on Saturday evening but they lost the chance of claiming a bronze medal after giving up a three-goal lead and eventually bowed to the host nation in a penalty shoot-out. Troyes is part of the City Football Group and Kabore has made 17 appearances in Ligue 1 so far in this campaign. Other players who scooped individual awards at the end of the biennial showpiece in Cameroon include Senegal duo Sadio Mane and Edouard Mendy who were named Player of the Tournament and Goalkeeper of the Tournament respectively. Meanwhile, Cameroon captain Vincent Aboubakar claimed the Golden Boot after scoring eight goals in seven matches.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/burkina-faso-right-back-kabore-named-afcon-2021-best-young/bltdb1ebe9c7df49afd,By Taiye Taiwo,edc0c9cc-47c6-4de6-952d-1ed725f0369e
AC Milan fan threatens leg amputation over Leao transfer rumours - and forward responds,"AC Milan's Rafael Leao has responded to a fan that threatened to amputate his leg if the forward does not sign a new contract at San Siro this summer. Leao, whose current deal is due to expire in 2024, has spent the last three years of his career on Milan's books and played a vital role in their run to Scudetto glory last season. The Italian champions are reportedly working to tie the 23-year-old down to fresh terms, but he has been linked with a summer transfer amid links with top clubs such as Chelsea - which has been a source of great distress for one Rossoneri supporter. The fan in question happens to have a tattoo of Leao on his lower leg, which they showed off in a video posted on their Twitter account on July 14. The account, created under the name Gabriele, also included a rather disturbing caption. ""If he [Leao] doesn't renew I'll cut my leg,"" the caption read. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ The post has received over 700 likes, and has even been seen by Leao, who has replied directly in order to try and dissuade the supporter from carrying out his threat. The Portugal international simply wrote back with a series of crying face and prayer hand emojis - picking up over 2000 likes for himself in the process. Leao recorded 11 goals and eight assists in 34 Serie A outings for Milan in 2021-22 to help them land their first title in 11 years. The talented attacker addressed speculation over his future mid-way through the campaign, telling DAZN: ""I‚Äôm happy with AC Milan and I want to make history here. I‚Äôm really loving my life with this club."" Leao also confirmed that his lawyers were in direct talks with Milan officials over a contract extension, and recent reports suggest he has been offered a new five-year deal.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ac-milan-fan-threatens-leg-amputation-over-leao-transfer-rumours-/blt13e9fe047b34959d,James Westwood,bb3f1137-392e-4d6a-84bd-73abbb54f5f1
Pitch-invading Nottingham Forest fan who headbutted Billy Sharp given 24-week prison sentence,"The pitch-invading Nottingham Forest supporter that headbutted Sheffield United striker Billy Sharp at the end of a Championship play-off semi-final encounter at the City Ground has been sentenced to 24 weeks in prison. Robert Biggs of Ilkeston, Derbyshire must serve jail time after admitting to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Nottingham Magistrates‚Äô Court on Thursday. His actions, which left Blades skipper and former Reds frontman Sharp requiring four stitches to a cut on his lip, were caught on camera as Forest celebrated booking tickets to Wembley after a thrilling penalty shootout. Biggs, a Forest season card holder, could clearly be seen on television charging at Sharp ‚Äì who missed the game in question through injury ‚Äì after entering the field of play as part of a mass pitch invasion. Prosecutor Marianne Connally told the court as his sentence was handed out: ‚ÄúA large number of fans entered the field of play. ‚ÄúMr Sharp hadn‚Äôt directly participated in the game. He appears to be standing with his hands in his pockets. ‚ÄúMr Biggs can be seen to run along the pitch. He then headbutts Mr Sharp. ‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äôs case is that this is a deliberate and senseless act of violence.‚Äù Biggs did not oppose an application for a football banning order during his hearing, with Forest having already vowed to prevent him from attending any further games in the future. They said in a statement released shortly after the incident in question: ‚ÄúThe club will work with the authorities to locate the individual in order they are held to account for their actions, which will include a life ban from Nottingham Forest.‚Äù Sharp, who is recovering from the injury he suffered, has posted on social media: ‚ÄúOne mindless idiot ruined what was an unbelievable night of football. Congratulations to Nottingham Forest on their victory and good luck in the final. ‚ÄúAs an ex-Forest player I will not let one scumbag ruin my respect for the Forest fans. ‚ÄúIncredibly proud to be captain of this group of Sheffield United players, they gave their all and can hold their heads up high. We will be back and go again. Thanks for all your messages and support after the incident.

'People talk too much!' - Neymar slams Messi critics after PSG stars combine to inspire Trophee des Champions success,"Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar has hit out at critics of team-mate Lionel Messi following the team's 4-0 win against Nantes in the Trophee des Champions. The Argentine attacker was a key figure in the French champions' first trophy win of the season, having scored the opening goal in the victory against last season's Coupe de France winners. Messi and Neymar received a lot of criticism last season as they and PSG failed to live up to expectations, but they have made the best possible start to the 2022-23 campaign. Neymar jumped to the defence of his fellow forward when he was asked if Sunday's performance was the beginning of a new Messi at PSG. ""I don't think so. I think people talk too much,"" he said to Prime Video. ""They don't know what's going on every day, what's going on inside.  ""Leo, it's Leo. It's still Leo, it doesn't change. No, he continues to make the difference. He adapts.  üîùüèÜ ùë≥ùíÜùíê ùë¥ùíÜùíîùíîùíä named MVP in the #TDC2022 ! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô pic.twitter.com/1BsGUKexGn ""It is obvious that we hope that everything goes well for the three of us, for me, for Leo, for Kylian [Mbappe]. If the three of us are well, I'm sure it's good for the team."" He added: ""I'm satisfied, we had a very good match with the team. It's very important to start winning, it's a match that ends in a trophy. Whatever happens, you have to win."" Messi and Neymar were targeted by PSG fans last season amid the team's failure in the Champions League. They crashed out at the last-16 stage after suffering a defeat against eventual champions Real Madrid. Messi put up good numbers in the European competition as he netted five times in seven games, but his record of six goals in Ligue 1 left many underwhelmed despite his 14 assists. Much more is expected of the ex-Barcelona hero this time around as PSG look to challenge for more silverware under new coach Christophe Galtier. Neymar, who scored two in Sunday's victory against Nantes, is also under pressure to make a bigger impact in the final third after finishing the 2021-22 campaign with 13 goals and six assists in the French top-flight. üèÖ After his brace, @neymarjr was in charge of distributing the medals ‚ú®Good night to all ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô pic.twitter.com/CHpoAtpopf",https://www.goal.com/en/news/people-talk-too-much-neymar-slams-messi-critics-psg-trophee/blt79854930a807d3bf,Peter McVitie,67bf5840-184a-45e8-b751-765a5fea750d
From Bayern troublemaker to Champions League star: Why the whole world wants to sign Karim Adeyemi,"When Bayern Munich face Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League on Wednesday, only two of the 22 players on the pitch will be Bayern academy graduates. Thomas Muller is a Bayern legend already, with 10 Bundesliga titles, two Champions Leagues and over 600 games for the club where he grew up. The other ex-Bayern academy player in the starting XIs will be Karim Adeyemi. The striker was also on the books in Munich but was cut as a nine-year-old back in 2012 and now finds himself lining up against the Bavarian giants. Bayern are often criticised for not producing enough top-class players through their academy, with then-club president Uli Hoeness even mentioning these failings when their new campus opened in 2017. ""In the last few years, the results of our work haven't been good. No player has even come close to making the first team since David Alaba,"" Hoeness said.¬† ""The new FC Bayern Campus will also provide one answer to the current transfer madness and the explosion of salaries."" Adeyemi looks like the perfect example of someone who would make the Bayern first team and negate the need for them to spend big on a long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski. However, he is very much the one that got away. After Bayern released him for punctuality reasons, he stayed in Munich, joining Unterhaching, a former Bundesliga side now languishing in the lower divisions. He impressed in Unterhaching's youth teams and despite Chelsea's scouts watching him closely and a trial with Liverpool, Adeyemi decided to join Salzburg for a fee of ‚Ç¨3.4 million (¬£2.9m/$3.7m). The staff at Unterhaching had helped him focus on his school work and improve his behaviour, particularly club president Manfred Schwabl, whom he views as a mentor. ""Karim was a little rascal in his childhood. We had to straighten him out a bit when it came to school. That he got there on time, had everything with him,"" Schwabl told GOAL. ""When he was 16, some clubs from England wanted to sign him. For example, some scouts from Chelsea came, but I don't know if that would have worked out. ""The move to Salzburg was exactly right because it's not too far away from his home in Munich. The closeness to his family is very important. He has a very good and stable environment."" Schwabl helped Adeyemi improve his grades at school by banning him from training and playing for the club. The teenager would still ride his bike from home to the training pitch, but Schwabl held firm and Adeyemi's effort at school quickly improved. There was no question mark over his application on a football field and, as an 11-year-old, he scored against Bayern's Under-11 side to knock them out of the 2013 Merkur Cup. At 15, he was playing for Unterhaching's U17s and, in a Champions Game with Heidenheim, with his side down to 10 men and the scores level at half-time, Adeyemi took it upon himself to be the hero. ""When we were in the dressing room,"" coach Ognen Zaric told GOAL and Spox, ""Karim suddenly spoke up and said, 'Coach, stay calm, I'll fix it.' ""In the end, we won the game 2-0 and Karim scored both goals after great solo runs."" Salzburg was the perfect next step for Adeyemi, initially honing his trade in Austria with sister club FC Liefering in the second division. Now, he is the latest free-scoring forward in Salzburg, following the well-trodden path of Erling Haaland and Patson Daka, with 14 goals in 18 Austrian Bundesliga games. Even more impressive is his Champions League return, with three goals and two assists in six games to send Salzburg into the last 16 for the first time in their history. Fate obviously paired him with Bayern Munich, who turned down the chance to sign him back before he moved to Salzburg. ""Manni Schwabl also contacted Uli Hoeness at the time and we weren‚Äôt willing to pay that much for him,"" former Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge admitted in 2021. ""At that time the transfer was supposed to be around ‚Ç¨3m (¬£2.5m/$3.4m). That was a very significant sum for a 16-year-old. ""He has developed well now. I have watched him play for Germany and now in the Champions League. He is an interesting player. ""We'll have to wait and see what's happening. Now he might cost an extra zero at the end."" Karim Adeyemi is a special talent... üî•And he's only turned 20 today! ü•≥#HBD | #UCL pic.twitter.com/xl8sq6S1DL Adeyemi greatly matured at Unterhaching and holds no ill will towards Bayern, preferring to focus on his present and his future as he continues to develop with Salzburg. ""At¬†Bayern¬†it quickly became clear that there was a precise plan. If you, as a player, stepped out of line or did not stick to this plan, you usually received little support,"" Adeyemi told GOAL. ""It remains to be seen whether they felt I had a lack of discipline. I don't think that was the decisive factor. It just didn't fit with Bayern anymore. We didn't get along so well anymore. ""The relationship between my parents and the sports director at the time was no longer as it should be. But that's yesterday's news."" Today's news is that Adeyemi could have the greatest revenge on his former club in the Champions League and then go one step further by joining their Bundesliga rivals. Unsurprisingly, Bayern have met with Adeyemi, while Liverpool have been linked, but the three-time Germany international looks set for a summer move to Borussia Dortmund. He has already agreed personal terms with BVB, but the clubs still need to agree a transfer fee. Rummenigge's ‚Ç¨30m (¬£25m/$34m) prediction may even be too low, with the forward now valued at ‚Ç¨40m (¬£33m/$45m) ‚Äì a figure which could rise even further if he can knock out Bayern, just like he did as an 11-year-old. Somewhat strangely, Bayern Munich's greatest recent academy product will end up being Dortmund's new superstar striker.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-troublemaker-champions-league-star-whole-world-wants-sign-/blt6d02ea0b5bf9ecfc,Ronan Murphy,5f0dd95f-e4cc-4de9-8a1f-ea6df1ad8742
Why did VAR rule out Nketiah goal & give Arsenal penalty but didn't award Man Utd spot-kick for Cedric handball?,"VAR has been a regular source of controversy ever since being introduced in the Premier League, and it caused confusion and outrage again in the first half of Arsenal's meeting with Manchester United on Saturday. Eddie Nketiah appeared to have put Arsenal 2-0 ahead against United - but VAR disallowed the goal for offside, only to give a penalty to the Gunners instead, which Bukayo Saka scored. There was controversy just before that too as Arsenal defender Cedric Soares appeared to handle the ball in the Gunners penalty area, but nothing was given. So why did this strange series of incidents occur and what decisions were made? GOAL takes a look... It goes from bad to worse for Man Utd...Alex Telles was judged to have fouled Bukayo Saka, who made it 2-0 from the spot after VAR intervened. pic.twitter.com/FO01aaKEoD Arsenal appeared to have gone two ahead in a crucial battle for the Premier League top four, when a slick Martin Odegaard pass from midfield was flicked on by Saka for Nketiah to finish past David de Gea. However, the referee was instructed by VAR that Nketiah was in an offside position when he got the ball, so the goal was disallowed - but matters did not stop there. As Saka flicked it on, he was clumsily fouled by Alex Telles, and so on-pitch referee Craig Pawson was summoned to look at the incident on his pitchside monitor. The penalty was given after video review, and was dispatched by Saka to put Arsenal 2-0 up - albeit not in the manner they originally expected.  In the first half, the Arsenal right back went to the floor under pressure from Jadon Sancho. As Cedric clambered on all fours to try and get back on his feet, his hand made contact with the ball and appeared to drag it away. Despite television cameras clearly picking this up, VAR did not call on Pawson to review the incident - with Sancho and his United team-mates left roaring in frustration. üì∏ - The Cedric/handball moment from earlier this game. pic.twitter.com/on2G5dYE0U",https://www.goal.com/en/news/var-nketiah-goal-penalty-saka-arsenal-man-utd/blt9d4a1cffd9a018ee,Emma Smith,94aad7f9-88d3-40f6-bd47-2a0558fcad3e
Watch: Dybala welcomed to Roma by 8000 fans in spine-tingling scenes at Square Colosseum,"Paulo Dybala received a glorious welcome to Roma on Tuesday as thousands of the Serie A side's fans turned out to see him. The Argentina star arrived at Rome's iconic Palazzo della Civilta Italiana, better known as the Square Colosseum, to give the capital club's supporters a first look at him in the famous Giallorossi jersey. Dybala made the switch to Jose Mourinho's side in a free transfer after leaving Juventus at the end of last season. Roma fans are jubilant about the arrival of the 28-year-old. Over the weekend, over 500,000 jerseys with his name and number were sold by the club shop, breaking a record for most shirts sold that had been set by Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus. The supporters got their first up close and personal look at him in the Roma shirt at his official presentation, with 8000 spectators reportedly showing up to welcome the Argentine forward.

However, the ex-Palermo attacker turned down the gesture and instead opted for No. 21. He said: ""The director had suggested that I take 10, which is very important here for what Totti has done. ""That shirt must still be his. I thanked them, because for such a shirt there must be respect and responsibility. ""Maybe one day I'll wear it, but today I'm happy with 21.""

'Stop the madness!' - Shakhtar CEO Sergey Palkin urges end to crisis in Ukraine after confirming youth team coach killed 'by fragment of a Russian shell',"Shakhtar Donetsk CEO Sergey Palkin has called for an end to the ‚Äúmadness‚Äù of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine while confirming that a youth coach employed by the club has been killed ‚Äúby a fragment of a Russian shell‚Äù. Millions of people in Ukraine are now living in fear after seeing Vladimir Putin sanction military advances into their country. Many have fled into neighbouring nations, but others have been left behind as flights are grounded and exit routes become shut off, with Palkin among those urging the people of Russia to stand up against the actions of their president. The Shakhtar CEO said in a message on Facebook: ‚ÄúI would like to address the owners, management and football players of Russian football clubs. Russia has carried out a terrible and treacherous military attack on Ukraine. A country in which each of you has visited and where you have always been welcomed. A country in which you have relatives, friends, acquaintances. The country where some of you were even born. And this country and its people are today being destroyed by the Russian army with all kinds of weapons. ‚ÄúYou are becoming an outcast. Russia, from a nation that has made tremendous efforts to defeat Nazism, is turning into a nation of terrorists, a nation of silent cowards. The whole world is watching you today. And the world expects you to act in a way that will stop the madness. But you're afraid, you're scared. In sports, fear is a feeling that reduces the probability of victory to zero. Your fear of going against the war in Ukraine has destroyed cities, your fear is thousands and thousands of deaths among civilians, your fear is dead children and maimed fates of millions. Your fear of going against the bloody regime is your greatest defeat. ""Although you did not give the order to exterminate Ukrainians, your silence is an aid to mass murder and destruction. ‚ÄúAn employee of ours was killed yesterday. Kids coach. He was killed by a fragment of a Russian shell. Russia, you are killing Ukrainians. Stop this madness! Don't be silent, speak up! Otherwise, it will be your personal defeat. A defeat that will be remembered by all generations to come. A defeat that cannot be erased from world history. And each of you will be guilty and responsible for the crimes committed.‚Äù Palkin also posted a number of pictures alongside the message: ‚ÄúLook at what the Russian military is doing to our cities!!!‚Äù FIFPRO confirmed on Tuesday that two Ukrainian footballers had been killed as political unrest in Eastern Europe escalates.

What is Lionel Messi's net worth and how much does the Inter Miami & Argentina star earn?,"Lionel Messi has headed to the United States for what could be the final chapter in his playing career, with David Beckham's Inter Miami providing the World Cup-winning Argentine a new challenge. In joining the Major League Soccer team, Messi has bid farewell to European football, but he will still be lucratively rewarded. Having made the bulk of his earnings across a lifetime at Barcelona and boosting that by joining Paris Saint-Germain - one of the richest clubs in the world - the Argentina captain, has commanded massive financial rewards. But exactly how much is Messi worth? While it's difficult to get an exact figure, we can accumulate plenty of information from what has been reported and compare his earnings to his rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi's net worth is estimated to be around $600 million (¬£464m) by Forbes, who put his total overall career earnings at $1.28 billion in 2023. These figures are speculative, though, especially as his business interests tend not to be widely publicised. The World Cup winner was placed second in Forbes' 2023 list of the highest paid athletes in the world in 2023, with reported earnings of $130 million, a figure which saw him place marginally behind Cristiano Ronaldo, whose move to Saudi Arabia helped him top the list. Interestingly, Messi was top of the 2022 list, with his earnings also reported at $130 million that year, with basketball superstar and part-owner of Liverpool, LeBron James, coming second. Forbes ranked Messi first among athletes on their list of the 100 highest-earning athletes of 2019, putting his income for that year at $127 million (¬£98m), and fourth overall, making him the best-earning footballer and athlete in the world. His position dropped to third in Forbes' 2020 list, behind Ronaldo and tennis star Roger Federer, in a year that saw many industries take a hit as a consequence of the global Covid-19 pandemic. However, Ronaldo was back up in Forbes' 2021 list, with total earnings of $120 million. Former UFC Featherweight and Lightweight champion Conor McGregor was first on the list with $180 million earned. The 1xbet welcome bonus is an exclusive offer for new customers Inter Miami are set to pay Messi between $125 million and $150 million (¬£100m and ¬£120m) across his two-and-a-half-year contract with the club. His annual salary, then, is roughly between $50 million and $60 million (¬£40m and ¬£46m), which is a slight improvement on what he was reportedly earning at PSG. If Messi's salary is $50 million a year, that works out at just under $1 million a week ($961k) and if it stands at $60 million a year, it would be just over $1 million a year ($1.1m). As well as a base salary, it is understood that Messi is set to receive bonuses based on performance and revenue generated. Read more about Messi's Inter Miami contract. Much like Ronaldo, Messi's many sponsorship deals are too numerous to list in their entirety but the most significant is with the makers of his boots. Their rivalry continues in the battle between Nike (Ronaldo) and Adidas (Messi) off the pitch. A couple of months or so after Ronaldo signed a ""long-term"" deal with Nike in 2016 that was rumoured to be similar to the lifetime agreement penned by basketball star LeBron James - and potentially worth $1 billion - Messi, lo and behold, did similar with Adidas. The exact terms were not disclosed, but reports in Spain suggest it will take him through at least until the end of his playing career. Messi has also been part of prominent campaigns with Pepsi, Gillette and Turkish Airlines. As part of their 2023 celebrity rich list, Forbes valued his endorsements at $65m¬†(¬£50m) for that year in total. His off-field earnings have increased with his on-field. More recent sponsorship partnerships include brands such as Hard Rock Cafe, Socios.com, Konami Mastercard, Lays, SikSilk, Leafty, Jacob & Co. and Gatorade. Part of Messi's appeal, of course, is his image as a pure footballer who takes little interest in the lavish lifestyle available to him off the field. His apparent lack of desire to branch out into other ventures and create a personal brand in some ways became a brand in itself, and is attractive to sponsors. But while Messi is not known to push lines of underwear and fragrances like Ronaldo, he has a line of clothing, featuring his own logo, at The Messi Store. He has also invested in property, including homes in the United States. Around his birthplace of Rosario in Argentina, for example, he put money into the Azahares del Parana project (a set of gated communities out of the city) as well as an apartment building in the city centre. Like many footballers, Messi also dipped his toe into the investment worlds of cryptocurrency and NFTs, working in partnership with Ethernity, a company which also worked with Pele and Luka Modric among others. There's almost certainly much more than that, but - as tends to be the case with Messi - it is kept pretty private. As is the case with his business interests, Messi's charity work is considerable but tends to be focused through sources and ventures he trusts. He has his own organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which he asked for donations to instead of wedding gifts when he married long-term partner Antonela Roccuzzo. The initiatives Messi backs are generally related to vulnerable children and their healthcare, and he was appointed an ambassador for Unicef in 2010 having worked with them since 2004. In 2020, during the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic Messi made donations to hospitals in Spain and Argentina to the tune of ‚Ç¨1 million. The foundation has also donated money to UNICEF and awards funding to research ventures as well as training programmes. Messi boasts extremely popular Facebook and Instagram pages but is not on Twitter, save for a 'Team Messi' account created by sponsors Adidas. As of July 2023, Messi had 480 million followers on Instagram and 115 million on Facebook, - a combined total of 595 million followers.

The forward's scoring performance equalled his career best between club and country for a single match, tying the mark he set in the Champions League against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. Messi has enjoyed a fantastic couple of weeks for the Albiceleste, as he played a lead role in their Finalissima victory over Italy last Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhat Leo generates is incredible,"" said team-mate Alejandro Gomez after the match. ""We know that in front of the goal he doesn't forgive you."" Head coach Lionel Scaloni added: ""I don't know what else to say about Messi, it's very difficult. You have no words left to describe him. Everything he generates is unique and it's a pleasure to have him in this group. I only have words of thanks to him. It's a pleasure to see him.""

'We only knew when UEFA put it on social media!' - Inside Portugal's crazy qualification for the Women's Euros,"""Did you see that you‚Äôre going to the Euros?"" That Andreia Jacinto‚Äôs mother saw the confirmation of Portugal‚Äôs participation in the 2022 UEFA Women‚Äôs Euros before the midfielder sums up the chaos surrounding the Seleccao's qualification. Moments later, the 19-year-old was celebrating with friends having seen the announcement herself on television.  After not thinking about the tournament for months, following defeat to Russia in the play-offs over a year prior, suddenly Portugal had just 65 days to prepare for what promises to be the biggest Women‚Äôs Euros yet. It was April 2021 when Francisco Neto‚Äôs side were beaten over two legs by just a single goal, a result that had every player in tears.  ‚ÄúWe knew that we could have done better in that play-off,‚Äù Jacinto tells GOAL. ‚ÄúOur goal was so close and we couldn't reach it. It was devastating.‚Äù However, in February, UEFA confirmed that Russia would not be allowed to compete in the Euros ‚Äì one of the many sporting sanctions it has been hit with following the country's invasion of Ukraine. As those who failed to qualify for Euro 2022 were waiting to find out who would replace them, none waited quite as anxiously ‚Äì or hopefully ‚Äì as Portugal, the team Russia had defeated and the one with the best record of the sides that had failed to qualify. It would be three months until the decision was communicated ‚Äì three long months of trying not to get their hopes up, while also focusing on World Cup qualification. Even things like end-of-season vacations had to be scheduled just right, just in case.  Jacinto made sure to plan hers for early June, while for Ines Pereira, the Portugal goalkeeper, her season would end on June 6, giving her just six days off in the end. Behind the scenes, the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) also needed to plan just in case the national team was to be given Russia's spot. They‚Äôd need the right friendlies to prepare, to think about camps and lots more. It was early May when the doubt was erased and plans could be properly put in motion. Pereira found out in quite a different way to most.  While the majority of her international colleagues had other team-mates around them, given all but two players in Portugal‚Äôs squad are based in their home country, the goalkeeper lines out for Servette in Switzerland. ‚ÄúWe only knew when UEFA put it on social media,‚Äù she explains to GOAL.  Of course, taking Russia's place also meant being in the same group as Switzerland. ‚ÄúRight away, my team-mates started asking about Portugal and saying they are going to win,"" she continued. ""It's a good competition between us. I'm looking forward to playing against them and ensuring that Portugal is going to win. ‚ÄúIt is a dream come true for me because the last time Portugal was at the Euros [in 2017], I was in the under-19 national team and I stayed at home, watching the games. ‚ÄúI called my family right away. I said, 'Portugal are going to the Euros and I'm going to work to be there'. ‚ÄúThey congratulated me and the team and they said, 'The hardest part, it's already done. Now it's the easiest part because the hardest part is to go to the Euro.' ""Now, we have to enjoy it but work hard to be the best version of us.‚Äù The Netherlands, the reigning champions, and Sweden, many people‚Äôs favourites, are also in Portugal‚Äôs group, but the Switzerland game will understandably be special for Pereira. Meanwhile, Jacinto, another of the 10 players in the squad that has never played at a major tournament, will be relishing another. ‚ÄúI really like to watch [Vivianne] Miedema play and we are going to play against the Netherlands in the group stage,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI just really want to play against her. She's such a complete player, then she finishes so well.‚Äù It‚Äôs certainly a difficult group, even without the short notice confirmation of qualification. But maybe it will work in Portugal‚Äôs favour. Perhaps this team, who beat a fancied Norway side in February, will be underestimated. ‚ÄúPeople don't really expect something from us,‚Äù Jacinto believes. ‚ÄúWe are just going to do our best and maybe we can surprise. ‚ÄúI think that the team really became more together [after the Russia defeat]. Failures are really important to grow, on the pitch and also mentally. Mentally, I think that we have really improved.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can see that in the Euro qualification, we got 19 points,‚Äù Pereira adds. ‚ÄúSome teams are at the Euros and they got less than that. ‚ÄúYou can see that Portugal are a team that is really hard to beat. We only conceded two goals [in qualifying]. We have to score more, but if you don't concede a goal, you are closer to winning the game.‚Äù Here are 23 players who didn‚Äôt think they were going to play at a major tournament this summer, 10 of whom have never done so. After a crazy few months of waiting and wondering, they are not going to let this chance pass them by. ‚ÄúI think it will be encouraging to know that maybe some people think that Portugal is a team that only goes to the Euro because of Russia,‚Äù Pereira says. ‚ÄúBut the truth is that we are going to show what we are, and we are going to try to do our best.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/uefa-social-media-portugal-qualification-women-euros/blt02640addb3e32722,Ame√© Ruszkai,83a1f44d-3378-43ac-9b6c-d01c632a0328
Bayern Munich sign Ajax full-back Mazraoui on free transfer,"Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of Ajax defender Noussair Mazraoui on a free transfer. The 24-year-old has signed a four-year deal and will officially join the club when his contract at Johan Cruyff ArenA expires at the end of next month. The Netherlands-born defender made more than 100 appearances for Ajax after graduating from the club‚Äôs youth academy, winning three Eredivisie titles and two Dutch Cups. Speaking about his move to the German champions, Mazraoui said: ""Straight from the first discussions with FC Bayern, I had a good feeling and I'm excited about joining one of the biggest clubs in Europe. ‚ÄúFC Bayern have just become German champions for the 10th year in a row and will be among the contenders to win the Champions League again next season.

We also really like his mentality - he's fired up for this challenge at FC Bayern."" Mazraoui joined Ajax‚Äôs academy at the age of eight before graduating to the senior side in 2018. He made 137 senior appearances for the Dutch giants, scoring 10 goals, but his departure had been expected after the defender made it clear he was not going to sign a new contract, with Bayern reportedly winning the race for his signature ahead of Barcelona. Though born in the Netherlands, Mazraoui has Moroccan nationality and made his debut for the national team in 2018, earning 12 international caps so far. He missed the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year after a falling out with Morocco coach Vahid Halilhodzic, but has since returned to the side and is likely to play a key role at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-munich-sign-ajax-full-back-mazraoui-on-free-transfer/blt9f5fb3fdb675d7d3,Tom Mallows,10d8d97b-b5f5-4c22-b94d-a5da65a5f598
Aston Villa‚Äôs Traore honoured to be managed by Liverpool legend Gerrard,"Bertrand Traore stated it is a privilege to be managed by England and Liverpool great Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa. Following the sack of Dean Smith, the English manager left his post at Rangers to become the Premier League side‚Äôs permanent manager. Under Gerrard, the Burkina Faso international has struggled for playing time¬† - featuring in just seven league matches in the 2021-22 campaign - with six of them as a substitute.¬† Notwithstanding, the 26-year-old forward claimed he has benefitted from learning from the retired English midfielder.¬† ""I watched him and supported him. We dream about this kind of player, now I am happy to be his player,"" Traore told BBC Sport Africa. ""He is one of the greatest players of the game. It is always a privilege to be coached by a legend. ""These kinds of players have experienced a lot, won a lot and know everything about the game.""It is always good to have advice from somebody who has so much experience and has done a lot in the game."" The former Chelsea and Olympique Lyon man remains the only player from Burkina Faso to have ever graced the English top-flight and also find the net. He went further, aiming to pass on his experience to his compatriots. ""I try to bring back this experience together with the other players,"" he continued.¬† ""We have some [others] who play in good leagues so we try to bring everything together and try to get the best team as possible."" Traore moved to Villa Park after falling out of favour at Lyon where he scored just four goals and provided five assists in 35 competitive appearances, his lowest goal involvement for the French giants.¬† His career began at Chelsea where he played 16 times between 2014 and 2017, scoring four goals and providing an assist. During that time, he was loaned out to Vitesse Arnhem and Ajax in the Netherlands. The African would be hoping to be considered for action when Aston Villa host Tottenham Hotspur in Saturday‚Äôs Premier League outing.¬† Having lost their last three games in all competitions, Gerrard‚Äôs men - who currently occupy the 11th position having accrued 36 points, would be aiming to return to winning ways.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aston-villa-traore-honoured-to-be-managed-by-liverpool/blt572f57d9c15e17c6,Shina Oludare - @sportingshina,9e7dd099-345e-4811-8a41-60844e870cd8
Premier League to introduce sexual consent training for all players in 'defining moment for football',"The Premier League is set to introduce mandatory sexual consent training for all players and staff. The news follows much-publicised police action against several top-flight footballers over the past year.  Women's groups have been calling for the Premier League to do more to educate its players on consent for some time.  Back in February, The End Violence Against Women Coalition, The Three Hijabis and Level Up penned an open letter to the FA and Premier League requesting action, and the latter has now acted.  As first reported by the Telegraph, the training will include content on recognising sexual harassment and bullying, relationships and obtaining consent.  The Premier League has previously run workshops for players aged between 14 and 23, but this is now being extended to all players and staff.  Although the Premier League has decided to introduce these measures, it is unclear whether the training will be extended to the entire footballing pyramid. Shaista Aziz, co-director of the Three Hijabis, has claimed that the FA are yet to engage with the group following their open letter.  ""We‚Äôre pleased to see the Premier League has adopted the action plan we sent in our open letter to them and the FA on the urgency needed to tackle gender-based violence in football,"" Aziz said.  ""This is an important first and long overdue step in the right direction. However, we need greater transparency on how this new guidance will be implemented by Premier League clubs. ""Any programme to tackle gender-based violence must be delivered by Violence Against Women and Girls specialists if it‚Äôs to be a meaningful change.  ""The details matter, as does transparency and accountability. We‚Äôve had productive meetings with the Premier League on these issues and look forward to meeting again to discuss implementation of our demands.  ""The FA, in contrast, continues to be opaque, out of step, and dismissive in its behaviours towards us. We call on the FA to urgently engage with tackling gender-based violence across football."" PFA chairman Maheta Molango also welcomed the news, saying: ""More needs to be done in terms of the education of the player ‚Äì sexual consent, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable, and making sure that this is part of their mandatory education.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/premier-league-sexual-consent-training-all-players/blt33eaaeab4f853b99,Matt O'Connor-Simpson,110468da-445b-448f-8687-53ac59b21e46
Scholes reveals Lingard has told him Man Utd dressing room 'is a disaster' in stunning revelation,"Manchester United legend Paul Scholes says Jesse Lingard has told him that the club's dressing room is a ""disaster"" as the Red Devils continued their slide with a loss to Arsenal on Saturday. In a match that was vital to the club's hopes of securing Champions League football for next season, Man Utd came undone as they fell 3-1 to Arsenal, another contender in the hunt for a top-four place. With the loss, Man Utd have lost three of their last four Premier League matches, with Scholes revealing that the atmosphere around the club has deteriorated. ""It's an absolute mess. It's a disaster of a dressing room,"" Scholes said on DAZN. ""I had a quick chat with Jesse the other day. I'm sure he won't mind me saying: that dressing room is a disaster."" It's been a difficult year at Old Trafford, with neither Ole Gunnar Solskhaer nor Ralf Rangnick able to steer the club in the right direction. As things stand, Man Utd sit sixth in the Premier League with there still being a possibility that the club misses out on European football altogether for next season. Man Utd are now six points behind Arsenal, who have a game in hand in fourth place, while Tottenham sit fifth, three points ahead of the Red Devils despite playing two fewer games.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/scholes-lingard-man-utd-dressing-room-disaster/blt805a1a3a184e3156,Ryan Tolmich,3cf97fb9-f30c-4841-9191-56900fb18961
Houghton & Kirby named in England's provisional UEFA Women's Euro squad but Nobbs out through injury,"England head coach Sarina Wiegman has named Steph Houghton and Fran Kirby in her provisional squad for the UEFA Women's Euro, giving both the chance to prove their fitness ahead of the tournament. The 28-player group was announced on Tuesday afternoon and will be cut to 23 in mid-June, with that final list of players to represent their country at a home Euros. The Lionesses will play three friendly matches in preparation for the tournament throughout June, facing Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland before kicking off the competition at Old Trafford against Austria on July 6. The inclusions of Houghton and Kirby are the most notable, given neither have played for their club for several months. Kirby has been struggling with a fatigue related problem since February but has made good progress on that front, training all of last week with Chelsea in the build-up to their Women's FA Cup final with Manchester City, which they won in extra time on Sunday. Kirby was an unused substitute at Wembley, making the Blues' squad for the first time in three months. ""I don't want to put any pressure on her because I love that kid and she's been through a lot, but she looked like she hadn't even been away,"" Hayes said. ""She looked that good in training and it was nice to see the smile on her face."" Houghton, meanwhile, has not played since January and had surgery on an Achilles problem the following month. The doubt surrounding her participation this summer was highlighted by Wiegman's decision to confirm Arsenal defender Leah Williamson as the captain of the national team going forward. ""The past 12 months have been very difficult from a football perspective, in trying to overcome a number of injuries,"" Houghton, England skipper since January 2014, wrote in a statement after the decision was announced. ""Sarina and the England staff have been hugely supportive but with the injuries, I understand and respect Sarina's decision to name a new captain. ""For me, I don't feel my England story is complete and I continue to work hard with my rehabilitation in trying to make the squad for this summer's home European Championship."" Another noteworthy inclusion is that of Chloe Kelly, the Manchester City winger having made her return from an ACL injury in April and been in superb form since. Sandy MacIver and Lucy Staniforth are also back in the squad after some time away. One of the stand-out absences in the team is Jordan Nobbs, the Arsenal midfielder who was ruled out for the final weeks of the Women's Super League season after picking up a knee injury at the beginning of May. On Tuesday, the Football Association confirmed that she has now been ruled out for the summer and will therefore miss the Euros. It's more disappointment for one of the country's most talented footballers, who was cruelly denied a place at the Women's World Cup just three years ago because of an ACL injury. Speaking upon the announcement of this provisional squad, head coach Wiegman said: ‚ÄúThe Euros are getting closer, and this is a big step towards the tournament. We have a settled squad and I know we have players in our team that will give everything to make it a summer to remember. ‚ÄúIt is important the players have the chance to get some rest now after a very busy season before we get back to our work. We then have a series of prep camps coming up and it is important we use this time to build an even closer connection on and off the pitch. ‚ÄúWe also look forward to welcoming those who have been working individually and with their clubs on their fitness in the past few weeks. We are hoping to have them back on the pitch when the series of prep camps start, so we can see where they are at.‚Äù England's first pre-tournament friendly is on June 16 against Belgium, with a game against Wiegman's home country, the Netherlands, to follow on June 24. The Lionesses' preparation will finish with an away fixture against Switzerland on June 30.

Neymar 'angry' at Champions League elimination amid 'difficult days' for PSG,"Neymar has admitted that he was ""angry"" after Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League elimination amid ""difficult days"" for the squad as a whole. PSG were in a strong position to reach the 2021-22 Champions League quarter-finals after winning the first leg of their round of 16 clash against Real Madrid 1-0 at Parc des Princes. Kylian Mbappe scored his and PSG's second goal of the tie to extend their lead at Santiago Bernabeu too, but Madrid completed a stunning turnaround to progress 3-2 on aggregate as Karim Benzema hit a hat-trick in the final 30 minutes. Neymar expressed his frustration over the final result while speaking at an event organised by one of his sponsors this week. ""I'm disappointed with the Champions League elimination. I was angry,"" said the Brazilian. ""I want to keep getting better. I want to keep scoring goals and winning titles. ""They were difficult days, difficult weeks for us. We didn't want to lose. We're not here for that, we didn't plan it."" PSG's commitment as a collective was called into question following their latest Champions League elimination, with Neymar one of several players accused of failing to deliver on the biggest stage. A number of supporters booed Neymar and Lionel Messi in their subsequent Ligue 1 victory over Bordeaux, while others resorted to vandalism as the outside walls of Parc des Princes were sprayed with graffiti taking aim at the club's sporting director Leonardo and president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Neymar has rejected the claim that PSG's loss to Madrid was down to a lack of effort, though, and says he pushed his body to the limit in order to even participate in the tie after a serious injury layoff. ""Nobody slowed down for this. Quite the opposite,"" said the 30-year-old. ""We dedicated ourselves, we committed and trained for this. ""I came back from an injury giving my life to be there at that time, even if it meant losing, but at least I would be with the team.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-angry-champions-league-elimination-difficult-days-psg/blt33f48340b0a39e0b,James Westwood,fc3ef1d9-2297-451d-9471-674dca401215
"Real Madrid‚Äôs Baby Galacticos: Rodrygo, Camavinga & Vinicius vindicating Perez‚Äôs transfer strategy","It starts with Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, but it ends with Rodrygo and Eduardo Camavinga. And the ending can be just as important as how it begins. Real Madrid‚Äôs feted veterans have played key roles in their conquest of La Liga and run to Saturday‚Äôs Champions League final, but their 'Baby Galacticos‚Äô have also been decisive from the bench in the suffocating final minutes, when legs are tiring and it's hard to keep a cool head. Against Manchester City and Chelsea in the semi-final and quarter-final second legs, respectively, the introductions of Rodrygo and Camavinga, in particular, were crucial in helping Madrid triumph in extra-time. And in the previous round against Paris Saint-Germain, Madrid were 2-0 down on aggregate until the same dynamic duo came on with 33 minutes left of the tie. One Benzema hat-trick later, and they won 3-2. Los Blancos‚Äô strong spine is known and admired, from Thibaut Courtois between the sticks, to experienced centre-back David Alaba, to the midfield trio which won three consecutive Champions Leagues between 2016-18, and spearhead Benzema, in the form of his life. However, the supporting cast of young talent that Ancelotti has been able to rely upon, largely from the bench, has also been crucial in Madrid reaching the final. Florentino Perez‚Äôs change in transfer strategy, dating back to 2015, deserves credit. Madrid have largely stopped trying to make huge signings for big transfer fees ‚Äì even their failed pursuit of Kylian Mbappe was technically on a Bosman ‚Äì and instead are investing in supremely talented young prospects who can explode at Santiago Bernabeu. That is why they are financially healthy, compared to rivals Barcelona, who under Josep Maria Bartomeu‚Äôs presidency adopted an early-2000s Madrid, Galactico-targeting approach to the market. The world in reverse. While Bartomeu burned hundreds of millions of euros on Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele and Antoine Griezmann, Madrid were more shrewd. With the exceptions of Eden Hazard and Luka Jovic, they have not spent more than ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£42m/$54m) on a single player since buying James Rodriguez in 2014. Camavinga arrived from Rennes for ‚Ç¨31m (¬£26m/$33m), Alaba on a free transfer, Rodrygo from Santos for ‚Ç¨45m (¬£38m/$48m), Vinicius from Flamengo for the same amount, Courtois from Chelsea for ‚Ç¨35m (¬£30m/$37.5m), and Toni Kroos for ‚Ç¨25m (¬£21m/$27m). This summer, Antonio Rudiger will arrive for free from Chelsea. Neymar is a figure who has played a big role both in Barcelona‚Äôs financial chaos and Madrid‚Äôs change in strategy. Having missed out on the Brazil star back in 2013, Perez signed both Vinicius and Rodrygo in a bid to find the next Neymar. Meanwhile, Barcelona, drunk on the ‚Ç¨222m (¬£189m/$238m) in cash PSG paid for Neymar, overspent that and then some trying to replace him. The shift in Madrid‚Äôs approach has also ensured the transition period from their multi-Champions League winning side of the 2010s will be far less painless than Barcelona‚Äôs post-Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi malaise. Despite the quality Modric is still showing at 36, and Benzema is at 34, change is inevitable. Madrid, though, have a stable of players who could potentially become greats themselves, with a little luck and more opportunity. Some say Ancelotti has kept them on the leash too long this season, with the exception of Vinicius, but the coach would argue that it means they are fresher and more desperate to impress, becoming the catalyst for their devastating impact in big games against PSG, Chelsea, City, as well as in La Liga in the thrilling 3-2 comeback against Sevilla, which Rodrygo sparked as a substitute. The one position in Real Madrid‚Äôs starting line up which doesn‚Äôt have a clear ‚Äòowner‚Äô is the right-wing spot in attack. Ancelotti has used Marco Asensio there, Ernesto Valverde there as a more defensive, hard-working option, and recently, Rodrygo has stepped into the limelight. From the word go it was clear that the NXGN 2020 winner has ‚Äògol‚Äô in his boots, bagging a perfect hat-trick against Galatasaray on only his second Champions League appearance, at 18 years and 301 days old. He beat Wayne Rooney‚Äôs record famous treble against Fenerbahce by 39 days, and the only player younger than Rodrygo to achieve the feat was Real Madrid legend Raul, who did it at 18 years and 113 days old, against Ferencvaros. Vinicius is the more explosive, thrilling player and has established himself as a key figure on the left flank, but Rodrygo‚Äôs natural nose for goal has made him an essential tool for Ancelotti to rely on when Madrid need to claw their way back into a game. OH WOW, OH WOW, OH WOW, OH WOW!!!!!Rodrygo bags his second goal in a matter of minutes!How has this happened!? üò±#UCL pic.twitter.com/WuimFkZdvI TWO GOALS IN TWO MINUTES FROM RODRYGO TO LEVEL THE TIE. BERNABEU BEDLAM!  ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/UAr6zwvhm2 Against PSG, his dangerous ball for Vinicius was badly cleared by Marquinhos for Benzema to convert the game-winning goal, and he drew fouls in dangerous areas with his quick footwork. Then, with Chelsea destroying Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, 3-0 up on the night and 4-3 up on aggregate, Modric sent an astonishingly good sliced, dipping cross to the back post, and Rodrygo maintained his composure to volley past Edouard Mendy. It forced extra time, and Benzema headed home the winner to fire Madrid into the semi-finals. This time, the glory was Rodrygo‚Äôs. Madrid were on the ropes, entering the 90th minute and 5-3 down on aggregate. Then, the 21-year-old darted to the near post to finish Benzema‚Äôs cut-back and a little over a minute later, the Brazil international headed home Dani Carvajal‚Äôs cross to force the game into extra-time. Madrid were ascendent, and when Rodrygo fired in a low cross for Benzema to run onto, the Frenchman was fouled by Ruben Dias. ‚ÄòKing Karim‚Äô converted the penalty, and Real Madrid were in the final. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain it,‚Äù said Rodrygo after the game. ‚ÄúGod looked at me and told me, today is your day.‚Äù Camavinga, meanwhile, has had an impact less easy to define by match-winning moments, but one which has been just as crucial in changing the game state to one which suits Madrid. The France midfielder helps whip the game into an intense frenzy, appearing everywhere, all at once, helping create the conditions that suit Madrid‚Äôs ability to mount comebacks. Sometimes it feels like Camavinga doesn‚Äôt have a set position at Madrid, in part because of the longevity of the current midfielders, none of whom he is a clean replacement for. But it‚Äôs also because he‚Äôs so capable of both big attacking and defensive jobs, driving past players with the ball, showing exquisite passing range and getting stuck into tackles. ‚ÄúThe future is secure,‚Äù said Ancelotti, considering Camavinga and Valverde in the midfield, and Rodrygo and Vinicius in the attack. With Uruguay international Valverde, 23, and Camavinga, 19, he has two-thirds of a potential Madrid midfield for the next decade. And after their impact this season, the future can‚Äôt come soon enough. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like not playing, I want to play more, but it will come naturally,‚Äù Camavinga told Telefoot.  He has started just 13 games in La Liga this season, coming on in 13 more. Eight of his nine Champions League appearances have come as a substitute, and he is hungry for more opportunities. Despite the Mbappe snub, Madrid have plenty to be excited about in the years going forward ‚Äì and it‚Äôs already paying dividends now. Liverpool will be dreading the sight of Rodrygo and Camavinga warming-up and waiting on the touchline in Paris, because as PSG, City and Chelsea can testify, it‚Äôs time to batten down the hatches ‚Äì trouble is coming.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-baby-galacticos-rodrygo-camavinga-vinicius/blt904579f42a9ee551,Rik Sharma,79f9642a-b2d2-4de8-aa48-93648d2ac1c4

The hosts on Saturday, however, are massive favourites to claim three points, with bet365 pricing them at 1/10 (1.10), with the draw at 9/1 (10.00) and the visitors at 25/1 (26.00). Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez are the two favourites to break the deadlock at 4/1 (5.00), while Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Raheem Sterling are all offered at 9/2 (5.50). The shortest priced Watford player to score first is Josh King at 22/1 (23.00). Watford's away form has been considerably better than their record at home, with Roy Hodgson's men winning two of their last five games on the road, as well as claiming a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, Saturday's return to Manchester is likely to be a much tougher prospect and City will be relishing the prospect of playing vulnerable opponents. The Blues look set to have all their attacking players available for the game and they have shown this season they are capable of demolishing sides in the lower part of the division. With a Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid in a few days' time, Guardiola will want to get the game won with the minimum of fuss and to try and give players a rest in the second half if possible. To that end, backing the hosts to get among the goals in the first half could make sense. Over 1.5 goals in the first half is offered at 10/11 (1.91) and looks like an excellent option for this game, one which has paid out in five of City's last eight home league matches. Odds correct at the time of writing. 18+. begambleaware.org ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/manchester-city-vs-watford-predictions-tips-and-betting-odds/bltcc4fe6c65c02609e,Phil Kitromilides,0705d823-86e7-41f9-99e2-9aaba4737b27
"Chelsea, Man City & Tottenham all keen on Cucurella transfer as interest in Brighton defender builds","A busy summer lies in store for Brighton defender Marc Cucurella as, after establishing himself as a Premier League star during his productive debut campaign at the Amex Stadium, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham are all now monitoring his situation. The 23-year-old, who is a product of the famed La Masia academy system at Barcelona, has seen his stock rise to the point that heavyweight outfits from the top four of English football are now mulling over summer approaches for his signature. Cucurella, who has one senior cap for Spain, may soon have some big decisions to make, while Brighton‚Äôs resolve to keep him in his current surroundings could be tested, with interest in his services continuing to build. The reigning Premier League champions are understood to be in the market for reinforcements down the left-hand side of their team. While Joao Cancelo is capable of filling a number of different positions in Pep Guardiola‚Äôs plans, he is not considered to be a natural fit at left-back. Oleksandr Zinchenko does slot seamlessly into that defensive berth, and could yet leave the Etihad Stadium this summer, with Cucurella viewed as a useful option to add depth and competition. GOAL first reported back in the spring of 2020 that Cucurella ‚Äì who was on loan at Getafe at the time ‚Äì had started to register on recruitment radars at Chelsea. The Blues remain admirers of the combative Spanish star, but are not expected to formalise their interest unless another international performer from that part of the world leaves Stamford Bridge. Barcelona are among those to have been linked with Marcos Alonso, but he remains in west London for now ‚Äì alongside England international Ben Chilwell ‚Äì and left-back is not a priority position for Thomas Tuchel to fill as yet. Antonio Conte is understood to have cast admiring glances in Cucurella‚Äôs direction due to his ability to slot in at left-back and centre-half. Spurs have been asking Ben Davies to do likewise of late, with the Wales international faring admirably, but another option would be most welcome in north London when it comes to that area. Cucurella started 35 Premier League games for Brighton last season, completing the full 90 minutes in 32 of those contests, and is clearly a key part of Graham Potter‚Äôs plans with the Seagulls. His only senior outing for Spain came in June 2021 when members of the Under-21s squad had to fill in against Lithuania during an outbreak of Covid-19 in Luis Enrique‚Äôs ranks, and he has not been called upon again since. He is a player that remains in contention for selection, though, and another big move would aid his cause in that department. Any deal will not come cheap for an ever-growing list of suitors, though, with the latest reports in England suggesting that Brighton will demand around ¬£45 million ($56m) from any sale.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-man-city-tottenham-cucurella-transfer-brighton/bltc794e1092c988d09,Jorge C.

Watch: Bayern defender Hernandez tricked into handball error after sly move from RB Lepzig's Dani Olmo,"Bayern Munich defender Lucas Hernandez was fooled into a handball error after a sly move from RB Leipzig's Dani Olmo in the German Super Cup final. The reigning Bundesliga champions won Saturday's contest 5-3, with Jamal Musiala, Benjamin Pavard, Serge Gnabry, Leroy Sane and new recruit Sadio Mane all on target. Bayern didn't have everything their own way, though, and Hernandez allowed himself to be deceived by Olmo in a particularly eye-catching incident deep into the second half. In the dying minutes of the game, Bayern full-back Alphonso Davies limped off the pitch after picking up an injury which halted the game and Leipzig had to give possession back to Julian Nagelsmann's side.  Leipzig winger Olmo did the honours but carefully left the ball dangling on the touchline, tricking Hernandez into believing that the ball had gone out for a throw-in.  As soon as Hernandez picked up the ball, the linesman raised his flag to signal a handball and a free-kick in Leipzig's favour. Dani Olmo leaving the ball on the line so he gets a handball freekick is the football IQ we love üß† pic.twitter.com/Jm5rR4At5W The cheeky gesture did not amuse the Bayern players, who were visibly annoyed and expressed their displeasure to the match officials after the incident.

Musona retired when he was still loved by Zimbabwe fans - Mapeza,"Zimbabwe coach Norman Mapeza said the time was right for Knowledge Musona to retire from international football. The 31-year-old opted to call it a day last week after playing for the Warriors since 2010, a period in which he featured 51 times and scored 24 goals. It was a decision taken a few months after Khama Billiat also announced his exit from the national team. Mapeza, who recently worked with Musona in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroon, described the level of professionalism exhibited by the former captain as second to none. ""I think it was the right time for him to call it a day when he was still loved by the fans, but we'll miss him,"" the 50-year-old tactician told BBC Sport Africa. ""His contribution to Zimbabwean football was immense. I gave Knowledge his first cap in 2010 and he was one of those guys that you could tell was committed to his job. He was very disciplined, a fantastic player. ""From his generation, he's one of the best players I worked with, and his professionalism was second to none."" In his retirement statement, the Al-Tai FC forward stated he wants to focus on his club career. ""It is with a heavy heart that I officially announce my retirement from national duty with our beloved national football team, the Warriors,"" Musona said. ""It‚Äôs a decision that I did not take lightly after representing our beloved country for 12 years, starting with my first appearance on March 3, 2010, in a game against South Africa. ""I am retiring to concentrate on my career at the club and to afford my other teammates and rising stars the opportunity to represent our beloved country. Over the course of my football career with the Warriors, I have been truly blessed in both the low moments and many wonderful highlights.""

'I don't remember him as a mentality monster' - Klopp bites back at Agbonlahor over unfair Man Utd criticsm,"Jurgen Klopp has hit back at Gabby Agbonlahor over his excessive criticism of Manchester United following their poor start to the season. Defeats against Brighton and Brentford have brought all the wrong headlines for Erik ten Hag and his side, with the ex-Aston Villa forward leading much of the negativity. Agbonlahor has built a relationship as quite a divisive figure during his time as a pundit at talkSPORT since retiring from his 13-year playing career. Klopp is clearly not a fan of his analysis and, in his pre-match press conference ahead of Liverpool's trip to Old Trafford, he made his feelings towards the former England international extremely clear. Discussing Manchester United's heavy defeat at Brentford last weekend, Klopp was keen to heap praise on Thomas Frank's side before outlining his disgust at the punditry offered by Agbonlahor. ""For United it is clear, it was not a nice week for United after the Brentford game,"" claimed the Reds boss. ""But we forget in these moments how good Brentford is, to be honest. ""It was that bad, I watched the first half here then I drove home and considered listening to talkSPORT and Gabby Agbonlahor. He lost against us 6-0 in my first year, I cannot remember him as a mentality monster on the pitch. But what he said about United on that show, I was close to calling in! I was close to calling in to tell him ‚Äòyou have forgot completely that you have been a player‚Äô. ""It was unbelievable and if ex-players are already like this, you can imagine how everything else is going. Now you just have to ask yourself ‚Äòhow would you want to react in a situation like this?‚Äô And you would, of course, fight back.

""Of course we spoke to Darwin and the reaction is like the reaction is in these situations,"" he said. ""He was very disappointed with himself. The things the centre-half [Joachim Andersen] did, he's not the only player in the world doing these kind of things. ""It's about emotions, it's about all these kind of things. We've never had a situation like this before it and that's why I'm not an expert in these talks because I don't need to have them that often. ""But it was that obvious that he knew anyway. He apologised which is absolutely fine but it's not necessary that he walks through the building with his head down, we told him that.

Everton sign Tarkowski on a free transfer after defender leaves Burnley following Premier League relegation,"Everton have completed their first signing of the summer transfer window after confirming the arrival of Burnley defender James Tarkowski. Twice-capped England international Tarkowski has arrived on a free after running his contract down at Turf Moor, ending his six-and-a-half year association with the Clarets. The 29-year-old could not stop Burnley from suffering relegation to the Championship last season, but will remain in the Premier League after signing up with Frank Lampard at Goodison Park. After undergoing a medical, Tarkowski has put pen to paper on a four-year contract, which will keep him on Merseyside until the summer of 2026. First signing of the summer: ‚úÖ pic.twitter.com/Zy3Jg2jGq2 Following their narrow escape from relegation in 2021-22, Lampard is overseeing a squad overhaul at Everton as he aims to have the Toffees back fighting in the top half of the Premier League table. Defence was a real area of concern last season, with Everton returning the fifth-worst record in goals conceded in the top flight with 66 from their 38 matches. Michael Keane and Mason Holgate were consistently criticised, while injuries to Yerry Mina and Ben Godfrey also hit the team hard. Tarkowski will add plenty of experience to the backline, having made 194 Premier League appearances. Known for having a no-nonsense style that was honed under Sean Dyche, the ex-Brentford man should add steel and grit to a defence that too often crumbled under pressure over the past 12 months. It looks set to be a busy summer at Everton, with Lampard having plenty of holes to fill if he is to avoid another relegation battle in 2022-23. Central midfield is the most pressing need, with Tottenham's Harry Winks the man most recently been linked with a move to Merseyside. Much of what Everton do will likely come down to whether they need to replace any departing players, most notably in attacking areas. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been linked with a move away from the club, and is reportedly a target of both Arsenal and Newcastle. Richarlison, meanwhile, has departed in a ¬£60 million switch to Tottenham.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everton-tarkowski-free-transfer-burnley/blt0b7c1c076397ada9,Tom Maston,144fc5ff-eda0-4df0-b3f5-7a140972ad64
Mendy wishes to see Mane win Champions League with Liverpool to stand chance of winning Ballon d'Or,"Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has revealed he would love to see Sadio Mane lifting the Champions League trophy with Liverpool to stand a chance of winning the Ballon d'Or. The Reds will be battling Real Madrid for the elite club competition title in Europe on Saturday at the Stade de France. Mane, who plays for Senegal alongside Mendy, has had a good campaign with Liverpool, winning the League Cup, the FA Cup and finishing second in the Premier League behind Manchester City. The Lions of Teranga attacker managed to score 16 Premier League goals and provided two assists. In the Champions League, he has played 12 matches and scored five times. The 30-year-old helped Senegal win their maiden Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) title at the beginning of the year. He has also steered the team to the Fifa World Cup to be held in Qatar later in the year. Mendy believes securing the Champions League title might work to Mane's advantage. ""I want Sadio to win the Champions League of course,"" the Blues shot-stopper told Foot Mercato. ""He is having an exceptional season, he is in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the Champions League will mark a turning point. He plays against his biggest competitor. Whoever emerges victorious will score a lot of points."" Mendy also lauded Los Blancos striker Karim Benzema for his achievements this season. He scored 27 goals and provided 12 assists to help his team win La Liga.  In the Champions League, the French striker also managed to get 15 goals in 11 matches played. ""Yes, [Benzema] he is one of the best strikers but when you play in the Premier League, you play against the best in the position in the world. He is part of it,"" Mendy continued. ""He has been at a very high level for many years. Everything that happens to him, he deserves it enormously, whether in the club or the recall in selection which dates from last year. He worked for and it is quite logical that he performs at this level.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mendy-wishes-to-see-mane-win-champions-league-with-liverpool/blta40d176ef345349f,Seth Willis,1ee48a1d-45f0-46ec-b66d-3d803ceb152d
Ten Hag fires warning to Ronaldo & Co as incoming Man Utd boss insists 'I won't change my view',"Erik ten Hag has warned Cristiano Ronaldo and the rest of Manchester United's superstars that he will not change his tactical approach to accommodate their needs, stressing that he intends to build a side in his own image. The Dutchman will succeed interim boss Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season, leaving Ajax to take up a contract at Old Trafford with the Red Devils. He will inherit a squad with no shortage of star names among the ranks, including Portuguese legend Ronaldo - but speaking now ahead of his arrival, Ten Hag says that he will stick to his tried-and-tested methods rather than breaking in new styles to appease big players. ""I think so, but I'll always be myself,"" the 52-year-old Dutch newspaper Trouw. ""I will not change my view on coaching. The type of players you have determines the way you play, but I'm in control of the demands and tasks that are asked of the players. ""I decide what task a player has. If someone doesn't perform his tasks, he will be made aware of that, no matter whom it may be. I will not compromise on that. I make demands about the way I want to work before I sign. If those demands aren't met, I'm not signing. ""The buck stops with me and I will be judged on the results of the team. I don't want to be a dictator, I want to work together, but I wanted to have a say in transfers, that was a condition for me."" Ten Hag is walking into a club struggling to recapture their faded glories, particularly after the apparent false dawn of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's final full season in charge. But the incoming boss acknowledges that there will be immediate pressure to perform, even if silverware may be a bridge too far straight out of the gate. ""I'm aware of that,"" he added. ""You just have to win, otherwise you'll be judged. And it's never enough.  ""For example, Ajax got more points per game after the winter break than before, but the view people have is that we were way better in the first half of the season.""

Lukaku returns just in time to keep Chelsea's title dreams alive,"With Chelsea's Premier League title hopes seemingly slipping away from them in recent weeks, Thomas Tuchel needed a hero. Fortunately for the Blues' manager and all of the club's fans, he is finally able to call upon his ¬£97.5 million ($136m) club-record signing Romelu Lukaku, and at Villa Park on Boxing Day, the Belgium international showed the difference he can make when he is fit and firing. Facing a nine-point deficit to leaders Manchester City at kick-off and after struggling for much of the first half against Aston Villa, Lukaku was introduced off the bench for only his sixth appearance since mid-October. What he produced could yet be the catalyst for the European champions to get their season back on track, as Lukaku first headed Chelsea in front 10 minutes after his introduction, before winning a stoppage-time penalty to seal the points in a 3-1 come-from-behind victory. As if to highlight Chelsea's attacking struggles this season, Jorginho is yet again the club's top scorer after his brace of penalties on Sunday took his tally to nine for the campaign. Lukaku was brought in to nudge the Italy midfielder off the top of that chart, but injury and Covid-19 have kept him on the sidelines for much of the first half of the season. ""Hopefully it will not be Jorginho at the end of the season as our top scorer!"" Tuchel said in October. ""We like him a lot and it is no offence to him, but we want our main guys to score regularly, hopefully, we can provide and create chances for them."" Both creating and finishing chances has been difficult for Chelsea during their run of just three wins in their last eight league matches, and in the first half against Villa they again lacked potency in attack. Christian Pulisic, yet again being utilised as a false nine, was largely anonymous through the opening 45 minutes, with the United States star unable to offer the outlet that Tuchel's possession-based side require from their attacking focal point. At the other end, Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins caused Chelsea's defence plenty of problems with their pace and movement, and Villa's lead was deserved, if not a little fortunate, when Reece James flicked a header into his own goal from Matt Targett's cross. Jorginho equalised fromt the spot before the break after Callum Hudson-Odoi was fouled by Matty Cash, but it was not until Lukaku was introduced that Chelsea managed to sustain an attacking threat. His return could not come soon enough, with the likes of Wolves, Everton and Manchester United having blunted the Blues with low blocks in recent weeks, and it was clear from his goal how his presence will allow Chelsea to play differently. Hudson-Odoi's in-swinging cross would not have been anywhere near as dangerous were Pulisic still playing up front, but Lukaku's physicality and intelligence of movement left Tyrone Mings flat-footed, with the striker's header his first league goal since Chelsea beat Villa on September 11. Just 10 minutes after coming on, Lukaku has his first Premier League goal since September üî•His movement is brilliant, nipping in front of Mings and glancing a header past Martinez! #AVFC 1-2 #CFCüì∫ Watch live on Sky Sports PLüì≤ #AVLCHE blog üëâ https://t.co/SdcdnD8pem pic.twitter.com/ItoUfqscUN Lukaku heads Chelsea into the lead! üì∫: NBC #AVLCHE #MyPLMorning pic.twitter.com/lxksobXzwQ After spending six weeks on the sidelines with an ankle injury, it was hoped that Lukaku would have been starting regularly by now, but a positive Covid-19 diagnosis has further stalled his second stint in west London. The 28-year-old has been using his home gym to remain in good condition during his week of self-isolation, and the work he has been doing could be seen with his final action of the game, as he burst away from the Villa defence before being brought down by Ezri Konsa for the game-sealing spot-kick. It was a run that harked back to Lukaku's time at Inter, and one that he described as his ""preferred action"" to Sky Sports post-match. Whether it will be one that he can repeat given Chelsea's general style remains to be seen, though there is no doubt that he can be a difference-maker in the second half of the season. Regarded as a leader in the dressing room due to his stature within the game and his ability to speak six languages, Lukaku's return to the fold will give anyone inside the club who was doubting Chelsea's title credentials a timely boost. If he can stay fit, then the title race has a real chance of remaining a three-horse affair.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-return-keep-chelsea-title-dreams-alive/blt023608e9e27e1bba,Nizaar Kinsella,73b3e812-5341-470e-886b-a1fe2140c59f
Inter release Eriksen following serious health scare for Danish playmaker at Euro 2020,"Serie A champions Inter have agreed to terminate the contract of Christian Eriksen, with the Danish midfielder unable to play competitive football in Italy following a serious health scare at Euro 2020. The 29-year-old suffered cardiac arrest when representing his country at last summer‚Äôs European Championship finals. He was subsequently fitted with a defibrillator and prevented from competing again in Serie A despite being tied to a deal at San Siro through to 2024. A statement on the club‚Äôs official website reads: ‚ÄúInter can confirm an agreement has been reached to terminate Christian Eriksen's contract by mutual consent.

""Let's see what January will bring us. I'll say more: two clubs have already called me to find out how he's doing,"" he said to La Gazzetta dello Sport.  ""And this happened some time ago, when he was still under contract with Inter but was already training on his own, away from the spotlight."" He added to The Daily Mail: ""Things look good. And he is feeling good. All physical results are positive. Christian has his dreams. ""Christian is doing really well. He has been training himself for months and things are going very well. ""It was clear that we would work towards this solution for a long time. Italy is simply the only country where as a rule you can't play with an ICD. ""So its a pity especially since Chris is so immensely loved by the fans. But on the other hand it's also positive because Chris now can look at the future with another perspective."" While Eriksen is unable to turn out in the Italian top-flight, he is free to continue his playing career elsewhere. He has been using the training facilities at Odense in his homeland with the intention being to stay in shape ahead of the winter transfer window. Eriksen, who has 109 international caps, can now start to sound out new employers with various clubs reported to have interest. There has been talk of Eriksen returning to Eredivisie giants Ajax, where he played in their famous academy.

'I don't regret a word' - Souness refuses to take back 'man's game' comments after criticism from Lionesses,"Graeme Souness has refused to backtrack on comments he made during Sky Sports' broadcast of Chelsea's fiery 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Sunday, despite receiving criticism from Women's Euro 2022 winner Bethany England and Lionesses legend Eniola Aluko. During his analysis of the hotly-contested fixture, Souness controversially remarked: ""It's a man's game all of a sudden again"". Souness was later criticised for his words by Aluko and England, with the latter telling him to 'get in the bin'. After his initial response to the controversy sparked further backlash, he has since released a statement saying football is ""for everyone to enjoy"". The former Liverpool boss insisted that he did not have any regrets when asked about the incident on talkSPORT. ‚ÄúNot a word of it,"" he said. ""Let me explain. I‚Äôve been advocating for years that the referees have such a major part to play in the success of the Premier League. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to be careful what we say today and I‚Äôve not been very good at that, but we were becoming like other leagues. ‚ÄúThey were blowing the whistle all the time and it wasn‚Äôt a good watch. Our game has always been unique, more meaty, more in your face and more intense and we got away from that. ‚ÄúMy comments yesterday were saying we‚Äôve got our game back. That is the kind of football I remember playing in. ‚ÄúI enjoyed two games of football yesterday where men were playing men and they got about themselves and were falling out with each other.‚Äú After initially failing to backtrack on his comments, Sky Sports eventually released a statement from Souness in which he claimed that 'football is a game for everyone'. ""To clarify my comments from yesterday, I was referring to the two Premier League matches I watched live on Sunday afternoon, rather than the sport of football,"" he wrote. ""Football is a game for everyone to enjoy.""

'You sh*t yourself in front of me' - Mourinho clashes with 'super aggressive' radio reporter,"Roma boss Jose Mourinho once more clashed with reporters in a fiery press conference on Saturday, telling one journalist 'you sh*t yourself in front of me'.  The ex-Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United manager was speaking ahead of his side's trip to Sampdoria this weekend.  But, as often happens, the 'Special One' drew all the headlines with some choice words for one of his interrogators at the conference.  ‚ÄúI expected a much more violent question from you. I heard you on the radio yesterday, you were much more aggressive, much more critical, much more violent. I was not expecting such an easy question,"" he fired upon receiving one particular question about his defence. ‚ÄúThe conclusion I therefore reach is that you are super aggressive and super violent on the radio, then you come here and sh*t yourself in front of me."" Mourinho's Roma remain in contention for Europe as the Serie A season enters its final stages.  With eight games left in 2021-22 they currently occupy sixth place, good enough as it stands for a Conference League berth, though Atalanta are hot on their heels with a game in hand.  Capital rivals Lazio, meanwhile, sit just a point ahead in Europa League qualifying; while even Juventus, in the fourth and final Champions League spot eight points above Roma, are not yet out of reach should Mourinho's charges enjoy a strong end to the campaign.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/you-sh-t-yourself-in-front-of-me-mourinho-clashes-super/bltcad62d2f73c99c2b,Daniel Edwards,5106df7a-f096-4fe6-bce7-542489e415fb
"PSG confirm Pochettino sacking as Galtier takes over to lead Mbappe, Messi and Co.","Paris-Saint Germain have simultaneously announced the sacking of manager Mauricio Pochettino and the hiring of his replacement Christophe Galtier amid a leadership restructure after forward Kylian Mbappe made the decision to snub Real Madrid. Mbappe extended his contract with the French champions in late May, much to the surprise of many observers, and changes within the organisation were expected to follow. Luis Campos has already replaced Leonardo as sporting director, and now Pochettino's exit is further show that PSG's ownership would not put up with another Champions League failure. Galtier, who last season managed Nice, has agreed to a two-year deal at Parc des Princes with the option of an extra year. He led Lille to a shock Ligue 1 title triumph in 2020-21, as PSG finished as runners-up, and guided Nice to the Coupe de France final and Europa Conference League qualification in 2021-22. Christophe Galtier is the new manager of PSG üá´üá∑ pic.twitter.com/LeAV97e5Fx A compensation package with Nice has been agreed that will allow Galtier to inherit the reins at Parc des Princes, with Pochettino heading elsewhere. Pochettino and his coaching staff have been paid a ‚Ç¨15 million compensation fee after being relieved of their duties, with Miguel d'Agostino, Jesus Perez, Sebastian Pochettino and Toni Jimenez following the Argentine out the exit door. While the club did not outline specific reasons for the move in their initial announcement, their Champions League exit to Real Madrid in the competition's last 16 was the turning point in the campaign that made the head coach's job tenuous. Pochettino and his players were forced to combat angry crowds at Parc des Princes for the remainder of the season, even as they won Ligue 1 by a wide margin. OFFICIAL: Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by PSG ‚ùå pic.twitter.com/kOUJay1yf2 In the end, the domestic success was not enough to save the 50-year-old's employment. The Argentine manager won the Coupe de France in 2021 after taking over mid-season from Thomas Tuchel before claiming Ligue 1 this term. But his side's European slip when in a winning position against Madrid, failure to defend the French Cup, and struggles to integrate new signings properly into the fold cast a shadow over his only full campaign. There have been reports that the forward only renewed on the condition that he could call some the shots at PSG - including forcing Pochettino out - but he has strongly denied that speculation. World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane has not been brought back to his native France just yet, despite initial links to the PSG job. GOAL reported on June 10 that discussions had been held between PSG and the legendary former Real Madrid boss. Positive progress was made with a big offer put on the table, but ex-Marseille star Zidane distanced himself from a move to the French capital as he delayed making a return to management. PSG went on to publicly deny interest in the manager, with president Nasser Al-Khelaifi claiming: ""I'll tell you one thing: we never spoke with him, neither directly nor indirectly.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-sack-pochettino-galtier-replace/bltce56476f303ee3bc,Dan Bernstein,3a151396-6559-4c0f-94d6-f167b52863db
'The Hand of God' is why Maradona was hated by some but loved by millions more,"Diego Maradona once said that his enduring fame owes much to the 'Hand of God'. ""That goal became part of soccer history,"" he wrote in his autobiography. ""There are still 10-year-old kids out there today with 'Maradona' on their backs. ""And that kind of insanity can only be explained by one goal. ""Or maybe two..."" Indeed, it is impossible to discuss Maradona's first goal for Argentina in their 2-1 win over England in the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup without almost immediately mentioning his second. The two are bound together in footballing folklore, perfectly contrasting examples of the ingenuity of the most polarising personality the game is ever likely to see. Maradona was the quintessential troubled genius, a man blessed with a gift that cursed him with a level of fame which he found himself unable to handle. Were he playing today, he would¬†undoubtedly benefit from more protection from referees ‚Äì and arguably from himself. ""In our era, footballers didn't get the support they needed,"" ex-England international John Barnes tells GOAL.  ""So, you had lots of players like Maradona back then who were considered a bit crazy. ""Now, though, I think that with the support and discipline inherent in the modern game, you don't get players like that anymore."" You don't get goals like the 'Hand of God' anymore either. With VAR, Maradona's opener against England would have been swiftly disallowed. There may not have been as many cameras at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on June 22, 1986 as there would be at an average top-flight game today, but it was clear to many of those¬†watching in real time that Maradona had used his hand to flick the ball past the onrushing Peter Shilton and into the net. ""We all saw it,"" Barnes said. ""All of us on the bench ‚Äì the players, the coaches, the manager ‚Äì we all saw it clear as day. We all knew he'd handled the ball, so we just couldn't believe the referee hadn't seen it."" Ali Bin Nasser has never blamed himself for failing to notice Maradona using his left hand to beat the onrushing England goalkeeper¬†Shilton to a miscued attempted clearance from Steve Hodge in the 51st minute of the game. The Tunisian official has always insisted that he was let down by his linesman, Bogdan Dochev. ‚ÄúIf you look at the match, you can see that Dochev was in a better position,‚Äù Bin Nasser told Ol√© in 2001. ""I had my doubts, but when I saw that the linesman was running toward the centre circle, I gave the goal because I was obliged to follow FIFA's rules [that the decision of the official with the better vantage point should take precedence]."" In Bin Nasser's defence, not everyone watching was sure what had happened either. Commentator Barry Davies, who was covering the game for the BBC, had initially thought that England's players were appealing for offside. Terry Fenwick, though, had seen the handball clearly and he raced up to the halfway line to remonstrate with Bin Nasser. However, only Glenn Hoddle was as visibly incensed as Fenwick, which bemused Argentina defender Oscar Ruggeri. ""Imagine if it had been the other way around,"" Ruggeri says to GOAL. ""We would still be chasing the referee today! ""But some of them, like us, probably thought Diego had beaten the goalkeeper to the ball with his head. Diego even told us that it had been a header! It was genius how he ran off celebrating. ""Myself and Tata (Jose Luis Brown) at the back didn't have permission to celebrate goals at the other end of the field because it would have meant an 80-metre sprint at altitude in insane heat. ""But Diego told the other guys, 'Celebrate, hug me!'"" Indeed, Maradona was initially worried that one of his own team-mate's¬†bemused reaction to such a blatant foul might result in his 'header' being disallowed. ""Checho (Sergio Batista) came over and asked me 'You knocked it in with your hand, right? Did you use your hand?'"" the legendary No.10 wrote in 'Touched by God'. ""And I answered, 'Shut the f*ck¬†up and keep on celebrating!' We were afraid they would disallow the goal but they didn't."" Maradona always remained unrepentant, partly because of the opposition that day. The quarter-final was played just four years after the Falklands War, which Argentina and the United Kingdom had fought over two British-dependent territories in the South Atlantic. The Albiceleste captain had insisted in the build-up that the game was ""only about football"" but both Argentina striker Jorge Valdano and England counterpart Gary Lineker have subsequently admitted that it was impossible for both sets of players to ignore the bitter political backdrop. Maradona himself admitted in Asif Kapadia's documentary on the Argentine's career that beating England was ""a beautiful feeling, a type of symbolic revenge against the English"" for the loss of las Malvinas. He has also claimed that he told his team-mates that he felt no shame about the deceitful nature of 'The Hand of God', as he christened it afterwards. ""I said to them: 'Those who steal from a thief are entitled to 100 years of forgiveness',"" he explained on his TV show 'La Noche del 10'. ""And the English had done a lot of things to us..."" The politicisation of the goal upset Shilton, who even turned down an invite to attend the premiere of the Maradona documentary last year.  He remains incredibly bitter about the fact that he will remain forever tied to the most memorable act of cheating in football history, primarily because he never received an apology from the perpetrator. ""After 30 years in the game there are a few things I‚Äôm really proud of,"" Shilton told The Guardian. ""The three that really matter are the most competitive games in professional football because it shows my longevity. ""Winning 125 caps for England sits alongside it and the other one is the joint-record of [most clean sheets in international football] along with Fabien Barthez. ""That obviously would have been my record if it hadn‚Äôt been for a certain Mr.¬†Maradona... ""I did everything I could to stop that handball and the famous photo shows that I‚Äôm closer to the ball than his head. That‚Äôs why he punched it in with this hand. ""You always have people saying: ‚ÄòOh, he out-jumped you.‚Äô He didn‚Äôt out-jump me. He cheated. ""So, to be associated with that moment..."" Shilton has even argued that England's players were still in a state of shock when Maradona scored his wondrous second goal just three minutes later, when the diminutive attacker slalomed his way through nearly the entire England team after picking up possession on halfway. ‚ÄúIt was typical of what he could do,‚Äù Shilton admitted. ‚ÄúBut we weren‚Äôt in the right frame of mind after what happened. When you know someone‚Äôs cheating, in a big match like that, your stomach drops. ""So, we weren‚Äôt quite tuned in to our defending after that... But you can‚Äôt take anything away from him. Maradona did what he‚Äôs capable of doing.‚Äù Barnes, meanwhile, maintains that Maradona's second goal was in no way influenced by his first. ""We were all international footballers, we'd all been playing professional football for a long time, so we'd seen many injustices in league games where goals shouldn't have been allowed for blatant offsides, fouls or whatever,"" the former Liverpool ace argued. ""So, for professional footballers to claim that they were stunned by the handball shocked me. To say that it had anything to do with the second goal is rubbish. ""I don't believe that it affected us in that way at all. Yes, there was a feeling of injustice. But it didn't affect the way we performed."" It certainly did not¬†affect Barnes, whose introduction with 16 minutes to go changed the game. The then-Watford ace teed up Lineker for one goal with a fantastic cross from the left flank and the pair would have conjured up an almost identical goal in the dying seconds had it not been for Julio Olarticoechea, who produced the most sensational clearance to seal victory for Argentina. Naturally, that England had come so close to forcing a draw only added to their sense of frustration at full-time.  Manager Bobby Robson bemoaned the standard of officiating, while Terry Butcher, Gary Stevens and Kenny Sansom confronted Maradona when they were all summoned to submit urine samples in the doping room afterwards. ""He came in and he was the last person we wanted to see,"" Butcher told the Daily Record.  ""He didn't speak English and I didn't speak Spanish but when I asked him whether he had used the head or the hand, he pointed to his head. ""Maybe that was because it was a small room and he feared us because there were three Englishmen and we weren't very happy! He probably took the safe option but that irritated me even more. ""If he had come in and said, 'It was my hand and I apologise', then I would probably have only hit him four or five times rather than the 20 I felt like. ""But I would pay a few thousand pounds to be in that room after the match again... Let's just put it like that."" Barnes, though, holds no ill will towards Maradona. ""I don't blame Maradona,"" he insists. ""I blame the referee and the officials for not seeing it. I don't have anything against Maradona. ""He was the best player in the world. And I was just watching everything he did. Of course, I was following the game and cheering us on. ""But I even watched him warm up. Watching the best player in the world¬†‚Äì possibly the best ever ‚Äì going through his repertoire was a thrill. ""And, you know, his second goal wasn't bad, was it? He ran half the length of the pitch! So, that was something to see. ""Also, it's not as if we've not seen other players handle the ball. We've all seen the likes of Michael Owen and Paul Scholes try to get goals that way. ""They just didn't get away with it because they weren't as clever as Maradona. And that quarter-final was all about Maradona."" As Valdano later stated, his team-mate's two goals of wildly contrasting qualities afforded the game a ""mythical status that the game probably didn't deserve"". For better or for worse, the match also propelled Maradona towards superstardom, casting him as the game's most compelling anti-hero. Should the 'Hand of God' have been disallowed? Absolutely. But there is no denying the perfect poetry of the most divisive figure in football following up the most infamous goal in history with its most beautiful just four minutes later. ""I‚Äôve never seen a better goal and it was my privilege to be on the pitch when it actually happened,"" said Hodge, who ended up in possession of Maradona's shirt, which sold for a record-breaking ¬£7.1 million ($9m) at an auction earlier this month. ""You say to your kids and your grandkids, ‚ÄòSee that fella there, I played against him twice and I tell you what‚Ä¶ he was brilliant!‚Äô"" There is so much more to the Maradona story than what happened that day in Mexico City but that game perfectly encapsulated his character.¬† It will clearly never be forgotten either.  Even after his passing, the English tabloid press labelled him ""a villain"" and ""a cheat"", with the Daily Star even asking ""Where was VAR when we needed it most?"" while the rest of the football world was mourning the death of its god. And that level of polarisation, that kind of insanity, can only be explained by two goals ‚Äì not just one.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-hand-of-god-why-maradona-is-hated-by-some-but-loved-by/5rztyc0ej6i31xcmft9uko4s5,Mark Doyle,91e3ef3f-9773-4596-8b0a-d576ac7cd8c4
Seven goals and pitch invasion mark chaotic last League Two matchday as Bristol Rovers claim incredible promotion,"Bristol Rovers earned an incredible 7-0 victory to claim their place in League One on the final day of the season on Saturday - and also saw their own fans storm the pitch in chaotic scenes against Scunthorpe.  The club needed to overturn a hefty goal deficit in order to pip Northampton to the third and final League Two promotion spot.  They reached their target with just minutes to go, sparking bedlam at Memorial Stadium which delayed confirmation of their ascent. Going into their clash with Scunthorpe, Bristol Rovers needed to either better Northampton's result against Barrow or else finish with a superior match goal difference of at least five in order to take third.  All indications pointed to disappointment, as their rivals ran out comfortable 3-1 winners at Barrow to sit on the verge of promotion.  Playing against the already relegated visitors though, Rovers came out firing and led 4-0 after an hour of play, a result still insufficient to top Northampton.  Just when it seemed time was up the hosts went up another gear, adding two more goals before Elliott Anderson headed in a seventh to put them ahead on goal difference.  Absolute madness for goal 7.It‚Äôs 7-0 to #BristolRovers üò≥ pic.twitter.com/2qWhsfkZIk Manager Joey Barton's hopes of calmly seeing out the final 10 minutes were extinguished when, immediately after Anderson's goal, scores of home fans started invading the pitch. ‚ÑπÔ∏è The game has been temporarily suspended as officials clear the pitch of supporters.

Rovers then suffered no other complications on their way to the final whistle and a much-desired return to League One, a year after suffering relegation to the fourth tier.

Maradona's son: I am convinced Messi will return to Barcelona ,"Diego Maradona's son Diego Sinagra has expressed his belief that Lionel Messi will return to Barcelona - perhaps even as soon as in the summer transfer window. Messi began his career at Barca back in 2004 and went on to help the club win 34 trophies, including 10 La Liga titles and the Champions League. The Argentina international also won seven Ballon d'Or awards at Camp Nou while becoming the club's all-time top goalscorer, but they had to let him go due to a financial crisis last summer - with Paris Saint-Germain subsequently snapping him up on a free transfer. Messi has so far failed to transfer his best form to Parc des Princes, scoring just seven goals in his first 22 games for Mauricio Pochettino's side. Sinagra, the son of Argentine legend Maradona, believes that the 34-year-old still belongs with Barca and can see him retracing his steps when the transfer window reopens. ‚ÄúI am convinced that Leo Messi will return to Barca.¬†Maybe this coming summer,"" Maradona Jr, who is currently the head coach of lower league Italian outfit Napoli United, has told Diario Sport.¬†""He doesn't look happy there.¬† ""Obviously he is a great player and when you play like that you show it wherever he is.¬†But his place is Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwithout a doubt."" Barca have slipped to fourth in La Liga and out of the Champions League since Messi's departure, but Sinagra thinks they have been unfairly criticised and are in good shape after some smart January business. ‚ÄúWhat club was not going to suffer his loss?¬†For me they are coping well,"" he added.¬†""If I say that Bar√ßa plays with [Ousmane] Demb√©l√©, [Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ferran [Torres], with [Adama] Traor√© and [Frenkie] De Jong, it's a team."" Sinagra was also pressed on how Messi compares to his father in the annals of football history, to which he replied: ""My old man has no comparison.¬†And not only in Argentina, they compared it all over the world but it doesn't make sense.¬†For me, after my old man, Messi comes in the history of football."" It appears unlikely that Messi will re-sign for Barca this year, given he is contracted to PSG until the end of the 2022-23 season and has the option of an extra season in Paris. However, the diminutive forward has already said that he wants to return to Camp Nou at some stage, whether that's in a playing capacity or a boardroom role post-retirement. ""I always said that I would love to be able to help the club,"" Messi said in November. ""I would love to be a technical secretary at some point.¬†I don't know if it will be at Barcelona or not.¬†Or if it will be elsewhere.¬† ""If there is a possibility, I would like to contribute again in what I can because it is the club that I love and I would love for it to continue to be good, to continue growing and to continue being one of the best in the world.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/maradona-s-son-i-am-convinced-messi-will-return-to-barcelona/blt5ccb2b9dc3f3c809,James Westwood,17ffe16b-611e-47f5-a522-8d5cc196dcb0
Qatar official labels Van Gaal ignorant over World Cup criticisms,"Qatar World Cup official Hassan Al Thawadi criticised Louis van Gaal for speaking out against the upcoming finals, suggesting that the Netherlands boss had no idea what the tournament meant for the nation and wider Arab region.  Van Gaal hit the headlines this week when he denounced as ""ridiculous"" the decision to move the World Cup to the Middle East.  But Al Thawadi contends that Qatar had as much right as any other footballing nation to be named as host.  ""First of all, let me say: for someone with years of experience, who understands how powerful football can be, it is ridiculous to make such a statement,"" Al Thawadi, whose position as Secretary General of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy in Qatar involves preparing the nation's infrastructure for the upcoming finals, responded to beIN Sports. ""He probably hasn't made much effort to understand what football means for Qatar and the Arab world.  ""He should take some time to see what the recent Arab Cup has meant for the people here. Then you see the passion in the Arab world, then you see what football means to us. ""It's not a ridiculous notion that an Arab nation hosts the World Cup."" The ex-Ajax, Barcelona and Manchester United coach, who sealed the Oranje's place at Qatar last year, held nothing back when asked for his opinion on the location.  ""I have already mentioned it in previous press conferences. I think it's ridiculous that the World Cup is there,"" he told reporters on Monday. ‚ÄúWe are playing in a country that FIFA says they want to develop football there. That's bulls*it, but it doesn't matter. It's about money, about commercial interests. That matters in FIFA. ""Why do you think I'm not on any committee at FIFA or UEFA with my expertise? Because I have always opposed these kinds of organizations.

Barcelona confident of signing Chelsea star Azpilicueta on free transfer,"Barcelona are confident of signing Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta on a free transfer this summer, GOAL understands.  Azpilicueta, 32, has been an established first-teamer for the Blues ever since he first moved to Stamford Bridge in 2012.  However he is at odds with the club over renewing his contract, giving Barca an opportunity to add him to their squad.  Keen to add quality and experience to their backline, Barcelona have made Azpilicueta a top target for the summer transfer window.  Coach Xavi is fighting hard to complete the deal, which would go through when his deal expires in June.  Chelsea hope to count on his services for 2022-23 and talks have taken place over a possible renewal.  For now though the two parties are yet to strike an agreement, with no new talks having been held between player and club since the beginning of January.  The Blues are only willing to offer him a one-year extension with the option for a further season because of the Spain international's age, less than would be on the table with Barca.  Azpilicueta joined Chelsea from Marseille in the summer of 2012 and has become a firm favourite at Stamford Bridge, racking up more than 400 appearances in his nine and a half years at the club.  During that time he has helped the Londoners to a host of trophies, including two Premier League titles and last year's Champions League.  Should he choose to leave, the Blues may face an extensive rebuilding task at the back over the summer.  Andrea Christensen and Antonio Rudiger are also out of contract and could leave, with both players yet to commit their future to the club.

Bayern Munich most expensive player sales - How Bavarians made over ‚Ç¨580 million in outgoing transfers,"Bayern Munich are not a selling club by default.  In fact, their sporting ambitions and success mean they are more of a buying club.  But that is not to say big players do not leave Bayern for pastures new. While some may have been looking for new challenges, some might be moving for sporting or economical reasons. In the summer of 2022, they sold Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona for ‚Ç¨45 million in what was a high-profile transfer saga.

PSG star Mbappe 'no longer wanted to play for France' due to lack of support following missed Euro 2020 penalty vs Switzerland,"Kylian Mbappe was prepared to walk out on the France national team after his penalty miss against Switzerland at Euro 2020, Noel Le Graet ‚Äì president of the French Football Federation (FFF) ‚Äì has revealed. The Paris Saint-Germain superstar fluffed his lines from 12 yards during a last-16 encounter at last summer‚Äôs European Championship that led to the reigning world champions bowing out of continental competition. Criticism was aimed in his direction, despite all that he has achieved for club and country, and there were suggestions at one stage that the 23-year-old would make himself unavailable to Les Bleus. Le Graet has told Le Journal du Dimanche of discussions held with Mbappe on the back of his failure from the spot against Switzerland: ‚ÄúI met with him after the Euros, he felt that the Federation had not defended him after his missed penalty and the criticism on the networks. ‚ÄúWe met for five minutes in my office. He was angry, he didn't want to play for the French team any more - which he obviously didn't mean. ‚ÄúYou know how it is, he's a winner, he was very frustrated, like all of us, by the elimination. ‚ÄúHe's so media-friendly.

He said at the time: ‚ÄúI have never taken a single euro to play for the French national team and I will always play for my national team for free. Above all, I never wanted to be a problem. ‚ÄúBut from the moment where I felt like that I was starting to become a problem and that people felt I was a problem‚Ä¶ I received the message, that my ego was what made us lose, that I wanted to take up too much space, and that without me, therefore, we might have won. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is the French national team and if the French national team is happier without me, [I'll go]. ‚ÄúI met with the president and we talked about it. What I went to complain to him about was that I was insulted and called a 'monkey' for missing a penalty. That is not the same thing. I will never complain about a penalty.

Why have Juventus punished Moise Kean? Disciplinary breach keeps striker out of squad,"Juventus have punished Moise Kean for disciplinary reasons causing the striker to miss their pre-season friendly against Atletico Madrid on Sunday, GOAL can confirm. The player was late to arrive for their game and has subsequently been left out of the squad. His spot in the Turin club's temporary new-look attack as been taken by youngster Matias Soule. Keane's career has endured a bumpy stretch, with Juventus his third club in four years. The 22-year-old is currently on a two-year loan deal from Everton with an obligation to buy, which Juventus looked to end early this summer after a first season in which the Italian made only 12 starts in Serie A.  However, he reportedly returned to camp this summer in great shape at the start of pre-season and scored two goals in a recent friendly with Barcelona, sparking hope of a revival. His potential has always been obvious. ""He is an important player for this squad,"" Massimiliano Allegri said late last season. ""Naturally, he is young and still needs to improve, especially his touch and control, but can be devastating when he has space to run into."" Kean has previously plied his trade in England with Everton and in France with Paris Saint-Germain, but is yet to fully emerge as a consistent starter.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/juventus-punished-moise-kean-disciplinary-breach-striker-out/blt95c81a9898b77643,Romeo Agresti,31bb93d3-f95d-41cd-8355-b7ae35367edd

When will Gio Reyna be back for Borussia Dortmund? USMNT star's absence explained,"Gio Reyna has been out of action for a number of months, missing some vital matches for both club and country. The U.S. men's national team and Borussia Dortmund star hasn't featured since September 2021 as he's battled a right hamstring injury. The question now is when Reyna will be available for both the USMNT and Dortmund.¬†GOAL¬†has all the information you need about the American star's injury. Reyna has been out of action since September 2 2021, when he suffered a hamstring injury during the USMNT's World Cup qualifier against El Salvador. He hasn't featured for either Dortmund or the U.S. since, having missed seven World Cup qualifiers for the latter. In addition, he's missed a vast majority of Dortmund's season, having featured in just three of the club's first 18 Bundesliga matches of the season. Dortmund boss Marco Rose has indicated that the club hope to have Reyna back at the end of January or early February, telling reporters: ""Without wanting to promise too much, let's aim for the break after our game against Hoffenheim to get him fully fit again."" It is not clear if Reyna will be deemed fit enough to join up with the USMNT during the international break, which runs from January 24 until February 2. Dortmund play Bayer Leverkusen on February 6, and then Union Berlin on February 13, so Reyna could potentially make an appearance in either one of these games. üéô Marco Rose:‚ÄúGio Reyna is doing part of team training again, and looks very good at the moment. Hopefully he‚Äôll be ready for short appearances soon. Gio gives us a lot of scoring threat and has high development potential."" pic.twitter.com/IqDfr0vCi9 The forward has had several false starts since suffering the injury, which turned out to be worse than originally feared. The American dressed for Dortmund's match against Eintracht Frankfurt on January 8 but did not get into the match. And, in the lead-up to Dortmund's match against Freiburg, coach Marco Rose¬†said that, while Reyna is ""on the right track"", he still isn't quite ready to make his return to the lineup just yet. Rose has confirmed that the earliest we will see Gio Reyna back in action is the other side of the January international window. Therefore, he will certainly miss upcoming games against St Pauli and Hoffenheim. It is not clear if USMNT boss Gregg Berhalter will name Reyna in his squad for January's World Cup qualifiers. During that international break, the U.S. will face El Salvador, Canada and Honduras as they look to edge closer to their spot in Qatar.

Ivory Coast‚Äôs Zaha: Crystal Palace can hurt anyone after Arsenal demolition,"Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha believes they have the quality needed to hurt any team after their 3-0 Premier League win against Arsenal on Monday. Playing at Selhurst Park, it was the Eagles who controlled the game from the onset and they took a deserved lead through Jean-Philippe Mateta before Ghana international Jordan Ayew made it 2-0 from a beautifully taken effort. The 29-year-old Zaha then wrapped up the emphatic victory after he converted from the penalty spot. The Ivory Coast international now believes the win against Arsenal has proved they can withstand any challenge in the top-flight. ‚ÄúWe worked on what we were going to do all week,‚Äù he told Sky Sports after the game as quoted by the club‚Äôs official website. ‚ÄúWe knew they would look to play inside, so we just tried to block the inside balls. When we had the chances we just countered, and we got the goals we needed. ‚ÄúI think the quality we have, we‚Äôve just got to impose ourselves in the games we play. It‚Äôs not about looking at the shirt badges; we‚Äôve got quality in our team. ‚ÄúIf we play the way we want to play, we can hurt anyone.‚Äù Zaha also believes the win will boost their confidence heading into their FA Cup semi-final fixture against Chelsea at Wembley on April 17. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs massive because it just shows the resilience the team has,‚Äù Zaha continued. ‚ÄúObviously in the past, we would score a goal and scramble. Now it shows that we can defend together, and we can attack together. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a massive confidence boost. But it‚Äôs a thing where we‚Äôre taking every game as it comes. Obviously [the semi-final] is a big game, but we‚Äôre just trying to win every game we can right now. ‚ÄúI always say: I feel like Palace are the best fans. They add a lot to our games ‚Äì when we‚Äôre under the cosh, hearing them cheering us on is literally like a 12th man. Credit to them. ‚ÄúIt shows that we don‚Äôt need to look over our shoulder. We can look up the table and try to move further on.‚Äù After Monday's effort, Zaha has scored 10 goals in the Premier League after managing 25 appearances.

"Chelsea target Fofana 'is not for sale' & Leicester have yet to receive an offer for Arsenal-linked Tielemans, says Rodgers","Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted Wesley Fofana is not for sale amid rumours linking the defender with a transfer to Chelsea. The 21-year-old has excelled since joining the Foxes in 2020 and his performances have led to speculation of a potential big-money move away. But Rodgers has claimed Fofana is going nowhere, while also assuring Leicester fans that no bids have come in for Arsenal target Youri Tielemans. It has been reported that Chelsea have identified Fofana as a priority target as head coach Thomas Tuchel seeks to reinforce his backline following the departure of Antonio Rudiger. Rodgers is still counting on the Frenchman for the 2022-23 season, though, as he said when quizzed on the Blues' interest: ""No, he‚Äôs not for sale. ""When we looked at him he had made 17 league starts. Everyone had a look at him back then but he‚Äôs come here, really flourished and developed, not just as a player but as a young man.

Wilshere named Arsenal U18s boss after announcing retirement at the age of 30,"Former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has announced his retirement at the age of 30, with the ex-England international bringing ‚Äúthe journey of a lifetime‚Äù to a close, and he has now been named as coach of the Gunners' Under-18s side. A man with 34 caps for the Three Lions to his name had dropped into a free agent pool again this summer after severing ties with Danish outfit AGF Aarhus. Rather than push himself through another pre-season of staying in shape while waiting on potential offers from elsewhere, a product of a famed academy system in north London has decided to hang up his boots and open a new chapter in his career aiding the development of future stars.  ‚ÄúJack will be the new head coach,"" head of the Gunners' academy Per Mertesacker said. ""Retiring just for us! I‚Äôm pleased for that.‚Äù Wilshere added: ‚ÄúI called him about 10 times a day for four weeks [about the job]. He‚Äôs been on that journey of retiring and stepping into something that‚Äôs unknown. His support has been great.‚Äù A man that suffered with a number of injuries during his playing days has posted on social media of his decision to call it a day: ""In truth it has been difficult to accept that my career has been slipping away in recent times due to reasons outside of my control whilst feeling that I have still had so much to give. ""Having played at the very highest level I have always held such ambitions within the game and if I am truthful I did not envisage being in this position at times. ""However, having had time to reflect and talk with those closest with me I know that now is the right time and despite the difficult moments I look back on my career with great pride at what I have achieved."" He added: ""It has been an unbelievable journey filled with so many incredible moments and I feel privileged to have experienced all that I did during my career. ""From being the little boy kicking a ball around in the garden to captaining my beloved Arsenal and playing for my country at a World Cup. I have lived my dream.‚Äù I‚Äôve lived my dream. Thank you all ‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/rB5gnyyUlK Alongside his appearances for England, which included two goals, Wilshere took in 197 outings for Arsenal after making a senior breakthrough at Emirates Stadium. He only found the target on 14 occasions, but was renowned for his work rate and ball-playing ability in the middle of the park that allowed others to thrive around him. Loan spells were taken in at Bolton and Bournemouth during his time with the Gunners, before a permanent move to West Ham was made when hitting free agency in the summer of 2018. All too familiar physical issues restricted Wilshere to just 19 games for the Hammers across three seasons in the East End. He returned to Bournemouth in 2019-20, who were then in the Championship, while a short spell was taken in with AGF after accepting a call from Denmark in February of 2022. Wilshere had left the door open for his association with professional football to continue and has now taken up a role in Arsenal's youth system following the departure of Dan Micciche to Crawley. He boasts a strong relationship with former team-mate Mertesacker and is looking forward to taking on a new challenge. He said: ‚ÄúI have enjoyed every moment of my career and it has been the journey of a lifetime.

Lukaku 'not happy' with Tuchel's system at Chelsea as striker talks up future Inter return,"Romelu Lukaku admits he is not happy with his current situation at Chelsea. The striker is working his way back to full fitness, having been limited to just five Premier League appearances since mid-October due to an injury and a bout of Covid-19.

Lukaku returned to Stamford Bridge after a successful spell with Inter, leaving months after they secured the Serie A title in 11 years. The Belgium international admits he regrets the way the move was handled, as his departure angered fans, but he is open to returning to the Italian top-flight in the future. ‚ÄúI think everything that happened was not supposed to happen like this,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHow I left Inter, how I communicated with the fans, this bothers me because it is not the right time now, but even when I left it was not the right time. ‚ÄúNow I think it is right to speak because I have always said that I have Inter in my heart, I will return to play there, I really hope so. ‚ÄúI am in love with Italy, this is rightly the time to talk and let people know what really happened without talking badly about people because I am not like that.‚Äù Lukaku continued: ""First I want to say a big apology to the Inter fans because I think the way I left should have been different.¬†I had to talk to you first, because the things you have done for me, for my family, for my mother, for my son, are things that remain for me in life.¬† ""I really hope in the depths of my heart to return to Inter, not at the end of my career, but at a still good level to hopefully win more.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lukaku-not-happy-with-tuchel-s-system-at-chelsea-as-striker/bltfe3f42a8d8061548,By Peter McVitie,1315e250-1704-488d-b55d-c700ff2d8e35

Portland Thorns defender Kelli Hubly on her journey from temporary player to NWSL mainstay ,"Kelli Hubly has spoken to GOAL about her rise to prominence in the NWSL, which has taken her from believing her career was over after a traumatic college experience to starring for one of the league's best teams. Hubly is about to begin her sixth year in the league, and has become an integral part of the Portland Thorns after entering as an unheralded national-team replacement player in 2017. But Hubly almost never reached the pro level, revealing last year that she played under a coach in college who nearly drove her to quit the game entirely. Amid a reckoning in the game over abusive coaches last year, Hubly took to Twitter to share her own story in December. Hubly said that in college at the University of Kentucky, her coach called her ""lazy"" after she failed a fitness test and suspended her from the team, though it later turned out she had an autoimmune disorder called Graves' disease that held her back physically. ""A lot of people still don't know that about me,"" Hubly told GOAL on All of US: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show. ""And when I posted that they were like, 'Wait, what? I had no idea.' ""It was a good time to share my story. Everyone coming out this past year is giving people support that they can come out as well. ""I felt alone and I want people to know that there are other people who have gone through this. You're not alone. It's not embarrassing. ""I wanted to help other girls who've gone through it. Like see someone come out the other end on top, and [know] there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You can still achieve any dream you want to after going through that."" Though she entered the league as an unheralded player, Hubly managed to stick with the Thorns and has developed into a key defender for last season's NWSL Shield winners. But after Hubly left the University of Kentucky and transferred to DePaul University in her hometown of Chicago, she simply wanted to rediscover her love for the game. After sitting out a year she starred at DePaul and, though she went undrafted, she landed a short-term deal in Portland when the Thorns were in need of reinforcements with players away on international duty. ""My first year I just went [to Portland] and was like, 'OK, I'm going to try, if I hate it, I'll leave.' ""I needed that first year here not being rostered to grow into the player I wanted to be. I still needed to get my mind working again, because it was hard not doing anything for a year. ""At that moment, I don't think I ever saw myself being where I am today. But I also knew I had a lot of potential that I'd never even tapped into. ""So I feel really fortunate to have landed in a place where they have helped me grow. They've given me the freedom to find who I am as a player and embrace that. And each year I feel like the ceiling just keeps getting taller ‚Äì there is no ceiling for me.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/portland-thorns-kelli-hubly-journey-nwsl-mainstay/bltbedbb4a8f9bed612,Seth Vertelney,b6f53933-af00-4380-b1a5-72df8690f0d2

According to reports, the aircraft had taken off from Barbados and was on its way to Sao Paulo when a problem was detected with its windscreen.  Neymar instead landed in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state near the northern border with Venezuela and Guyana.  The PSG ace spent two hours at the regional airport while the problem was attended to, and was greeted warmly by workers.  The player spent his summer holiday with his sister, Rafaella Santos, and partner Bruna Biancardi.  The group spent time in Las Vegas and Miami last week, while there was also time to visit close friend Cris Guedes and Bianca Coimbra, who have named Neymar godfather to their unborn daughter Antonella. Rafaella shared a photo of the siblings on the runway with the plane in the background, declaring that ""It is great sharing my life with you!""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/neymar-s-private-jet-has-to-make-emergency-landing-as-psg/blt85de7b6158b7959c,Daniel Edwards,4a7172fc-b993-429e-a901-2da15e0f0aa3
Chelsea being run 'day to day' after sanctions on owner Abramovich - Cech,"Chelsea technical director Petr Cech says the club is being run on a ""day-to-day"" basis after the sanctions imposed on owner Roman Abramovich. The UK government froze Abramovich's assets last week amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, effectively blocking the 55-year-old's proposed sale of Chelsea. Abramovich, who invited bids in excess of ¬£2 billion for the club in response to the military conflict, has also been disqualified as a Stamford Bridge director and limitations have been set on what money the Blues can now spend. Chelsea are still able to honour their remaining 2021-22 fixtures under a 'special licence' from the government, but cannot make any transfers and only season-ticket holders are able to attend matches. Cech admits that the situation has created a lot of uncertainty but everyone at the club is taking each day as it comes while awaiting clarity on how best to move forward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been devastating to watch what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine and our thoughts are with the victims of the situation. I hope people will stop suffering,"" Cech, who played as a goalkeeper for the club for almost a decade, told Sky Sports before their latest Premier League outing against Newcastle. ‚ÄúWhen you compare (it) to what‚Äôs been happening here, it‚Äôs a difficult situation. We have many questions, we don‚Äôt have many answers but we are determined to concentrate on things we can control. ‚ÄúWe are going day by day to try and finish the season.‚Äù Pressed on whether the club can continue paying staff wages, Cech replied: ‚ÄúWe hope the situation will be clearer soon. We hope people working for the club will be able to get their salaries and to live their lives and work. ‚ÄúThis is a difficult question for me to answer because I don‚Äôt have the answers. I don't know what the lessons will be like in days. Without answers, it‚Äôs difficult to plan.‚Äù The future of head coach Thomas Tuchel has also been called into question due to the off-field issues at Chelsea. Cech says the German's position is secure at the moment, but he can make no guarantees that won't change in the coming days or weeks. ‚ÄúThomas has a contract until 2024, as it stands we‚Äôve been told that the contract will be valued,‚Äù said Cech. ‚ÄúWe hope we will have him as a coach because he‚Äôs been brilliant on every level. ‚ÄúBut tomorrow the situation can change and my answer will be irrelevant.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-run-day-to-day-sanctions-owner-abramovich-cech/blt5ef03e07dc9436eb,James Westwood,669b0433-9857-49c1-ad43-60c4e6c2a43f
Watch: Man Utd's De Gea nominated twice for Premier League save of the season with Alisson and Mendy also in contention,"Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has had two of his stops nominated for 2021-22 Premier League Save of the Season. De Gea is the only player who appears twice on the 10-save shortlist released on Wednesday, with the likes of Alisson and Edouard Mendy making the cut once apiece. The winner will be announced on May 28. The shot-stopper began the year in tight competition for the starting role with Dean Henderson, but he quickly separated himself with highlight-reel saves, including one against Wolves on August 29 that was nominated for Save of the Season.

Willian: I wanted to leave Arsenal after three months,"Willian has admitted he wanted to leave Arsenal after just three months because he ""wasn't happy"" in north London. Arsenal signed Willian on a free transfer following his departure from Chelsea in the summer of 2020, tying him down to a three-year contract. However, the Brazilian asked to cut short that agreement in August before rejoining boyhood club Corinthians, having struggled to reach his best level during his single campaign at Emirates Stadium. Willian has now opened up on his departure, telling Rio Ferdinand's YouTube channel FIVE: ""I was not happy, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt perform. I don‚Äôt want to go into the details, but I wasn‚Äôt happy. ""So, when I arrived there I was happy, from the beginning I was motivated, I wanted to do well, new club, new mates, new projects. ""After three months, I told my agent 'please, I want to go'. I don‚Äôt want to speak bad about the club because it is a big club, has a big history in football, big players played there before it‚Äôs a big club - but it didn‚Äôt work, it was of course the most difficult time of my career."" The 33-year-old forwent two years of wages when Arsenal agreed to terminate his contract, but he was more than willing to make that sacrifice in order to rediscover his passion for the game. ""Yeah, it was big money that I gave up ‚Äì money is not the most important thing in life, you need to be happy, to be getting pleasure and wake up and want to go to training,"" he said. ""I wasn‚Äôt having that, so I said to myself, with my family and my wife ‚ÄòI cannot stay here, I am not happy here, I have to leave and find a way out to leave the club.' For me, it is unfair to stay in a place you don‚Äôt want to stay just because of the money."" Willian forged a reputation as one of the top midfielders in the Premier League during his seven-year stay at Chelsea, winning two league titles. The Brazil international was never able to show the same kind of form at Arsenal, though, as he scored just once in 37 games across all competitions in 2020-21. Gunners supporters weren't shy in letting Willian know he was failing to live up to expectations, and he says their opinion ultimately helped him make up his mind to move on. ""I received a lot of messages on social media from them and also because I came from Chelsea,"" he said. ""I think if I came from another club it would have been better for them but also because I came from Chelsea and didn‚Äôt perform well - I think about that and say ‚ÄòI have to go.‚Äô‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/willian-wanted-leave-arsenal-three-months/blt2790f10e0c88e190,James Westwood,1b0566e9-c56a-4752-b668-ec746805ed2b
Ugly scenes in Abuja as angry Nigeria fans force Ghana players off the field,"Angry Nigeria fans sent Ghana players away from the field after their 1-1 draw in the second leg of the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifying tie.  Tuesday's result was not enough for the Super Eagles to qualify for the tournament in Qatar later this year. Thomas Partey's opening goal helped Ghana progress based on away goals after they held Augustine Eguavoen to a goalless draw in Kumasi on Friday. Meanwhile, William Troost-Ekong's equaliser could not inspire the Super Eagles to victory which leaves them waiting for the next World Cup in 2026. The result came as a disappointment for the home fans and they took matters into their hands with fans destroying stadium facilities at the end of the game. The invasion forced the joyful Black Stars players, who were celebrating their victory, into the dressing room and the stadium security attempted to disperse the crowd with teargas.

Sargent told by Norwich boss Smith what he needs to do to score first Premier League goal ,"Josh Sargent has been advised on how to break his Premier League goal duck, with Norwich manager Dean Smith convinced that the United States international has what it takes to be a success in England. The 21-year-old forward moved to Carrow Road from Werder Bremen over the summer and has taken in 15 appearances for the Canaries so far. He found the target on two occasions in a 6-0 Carabao Cup drubbing of Bournemouth back in August, but is still waiting on a first effort in the English top flight ‚Äì with some big opportunities passing him by of late. Quizzed on what USMNT star Sargent needs to do in order to discover a spark in the final third, Norwich boss Smith told reporters: ‚ÄúI hope it isn‚Äôt weighing on him. ‚ÄúSince I have been here he has played as a wide forward. At half-time in the Southampton game he pretty much helped change the performance. His work rate is there for all to see. ‚ÄúThere was an early chance in the Wolves game he put over and he would be disappointed with the chance he had at the far post against Newcastle. ‚ÄúIf he keeps working hard the rewards usually come. He is a really diligent lad who works hard every day. He understands the game and you can see that there's a want and a need to go and score that first goal and, once he does, I am sure he will be flying. ‚ÄúI saw him play for Werder Bremen as well as America before I came to the club. I've seen Josh a few times. His work ethic is right up there and it's something that you come to expect from American players anyway. They have a huge work ethic. ""Tactically he is obviously learning the game because he is still a young player. But when he came off the bench against Southampton he made an impact and that is what we want. We want them to make an impact and change games.‚Äù Sargent helped Norwich to a welcome 2-1 win over Southampton on November 20 and has figured regularly in a five-game run for the Canaries that has delivered eight much-needed points. Smith‚Äôs side still find themselves at the foot of the Premier League table, but they are now level with Newcastle and Burnley just above them and only three points away from clambering out of the relegation zone. A testing home date with Manchester United is next on the agenda, with the Red Devils due in Norfolk on Saturday, but Sargent and Co should be feeling confident as sights are set on playing to potential and steering a course to safety.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/sargent-norwich-smith-score-first-premier-league-goal/blt9921195bc613b219,Chris Burton,c8402bc4-862f-4ab2-84c7-235f16f9242e
'Where it all began!' - Mane returns to home Senegal village for match with Premier League stars,"Sadio Mane returned to his birth village of Bambali in Senegal to stage a match with former Premier League stars this week. The Reds attacker is at the centre of one of the summer's biggest transfer stories, following domestic double glory and Premier League and Champions League heartbreak under Jurgen Klopp this season. But amid ongoing discussion linking the forward with a move to Bayern Munich, the 30-year-old has headed home during the off-season for a muddy kickabout with a host of familiar faces. The 30-year-old was spotted alongside ex-Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse and former Liverpool forward El-Hadji Diouf, as well as international team-mate Mbaye Diagne and Beninese star Desire Segbe this week on a muddy pitch. ""Back to the source with a gala match on the Bambali pitch where it all started!!!"" Mane wrote on Instagram, dropping pictures of the event onto social media. ""A big thank you to my brothers!"" Far from it! The Senegal star is as known in his home country for his philanthropic efforts as he is for steering the nation to AFCON glory earlier this year, followed by World Cup qualification - at the expense of Liverpool team-mate and Egypt star Mohamed Salah on both occasions. He has helped build a hospital and a school in his hometown, as he seeks to improve the way of life for the people there.

"Newcastle vs Everton: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Everton are aiming to end their five-game winless run in the Premier League when they visit relegation-threatened Newcastle on Tuesday. After beating Brentford 4-1 in the FA Cup in their first match under new coach Frank Lampard, the Toffees hope to lift themselves further away from the drop zone by collecting the three points. But second-bottom side Newcastle are unbeaten in their last three matches, most recently beating Leeds, and can pull themselves out of the relegation places by continuing that run. At 8/5 (2.6) with bet365, Newcastle are slight favourites to win the match at St James' Park. Everton are available at 7/4 (2.75) and the draw is priced at 9/4 (3.25). Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin is the shortest priced player to open the scoring at 5/1 (6.00), while Newcastle's Chris Wood is available at 11/2 (6.50). Dwight Gayle, Salomon Rondon and Richarlison are all offered at 13/2 (7.50). Federico Fernandez, Paul Dummett and Joelinton are doubts for the hosts, while Callum Wilson will miss the game with an injury. January signings Dan Burn, Matt Targett and Chris Wood could all be included in the starting XI by coach Eddie Howe. The Magpies are in dire need of another win as they look to claw their way out of the relegation zone, but they face an Everton team full of players looking to impress their new manager following their FA Cup victory at the weekend. Fabian Delph, Tom Davies and Abdoulaye Doucoure are still missing for the Toffees, while Ben Godfrey is out with a hamstring problem. Dominic Calvert-Lewin may return to the squad, however, depending on a late fitness test. Both teams to score is priced at 7/10 (1.7) and looks like a fair bet as Newcastle and Everton will be determined to put each other under pressure, but they have had difficulty shutting sides out recently.

'Change is coming!' - Man Utd CEO Arnold confident Ten Hag appointment will lead to turnaround,"Manchester United CEO Richard Arnold is confident the appointment of Erik ten Hag will help the club to achieve long-term success, albeit warning it won't be achieved ""overnight"". The Red Devils endured a miserable 2021-22 campaign which saw them miss out on silverware and a place in next season's Champions League. Ten Hag has been charged with guiding the team going forward and the club's chief executive has urged fans to be patient. ""Suffice to say we are not happy with where we are in terms of performance on the pitch,"" Arnold said at a fans' forum.  ""We understand fans are frustrated and want to see change and improvement and I can assure you that we share that frustration very intensely within the club. ""We also feel confidence that change is coming because of the action being taken to drive long-term success.  ""The appointment of Erik ten Hag was the most visible example of that action and the most important. Success won't be achieved overnight but we are determined to get there."" United's football director John Murtough said at the fans' forum that Ten Hag will have some influence when it comes to recruiting new players this summer and that a few academy graduates are expected to come through to the senior team. ""Erik will aim to maximise the potential of existing players while building towards long-term success,"" he said.  ""The squad will be strengthened and renewed this summer and Erik will be a key voice in this process, together with the recruitment department to identify and secure targets.

Balotelli gets another face tattoo as he has 'MB459' inked below his eye,"Mario Balotelli remains a larger-than-life character, with the enigmatic Italian striker revealing that he has added to a collection of facial tattoos by getting ‚ÄòMB459‚Äô inked below his eye. The former Inter, Manchester City and Liverpool frontman already has a number of designs adorning various parts of his body, with much of the artwork he has commissioned boasting personal meaning. That is definitely the case with the 31-year-old‚Äôs latest offering, with his initials now figuring prominently underneath his left eye. A man left out of Italy‚Äôs squad for their unsuccessful bid to reach the 2022 World Cup previously had tattoos etched onto his face and neck back in 2020. He had the words ‚ÄòBlack Power‚Äô added above his eye, along with a cross on his right cheek and an eagle‚Äôs feather on the other side of his face. Balotelli also has a snarling gorilla‚Äôs face on his neck and the letter ‚ÄòM‚Äô. On his chest, a man now plying his club trade at Adana Demirspor has gone for a quote from Mongol warlord Genghis Khan. That tattoo reads: ‚ÄúI am the punishment of God. ‚ÄúIf you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.‚Äù Many had expected Balotelli to currently be otherwise engaged in chasing down a place at Qatar 2022, but his form in Turkey failed to convince Italy boss Roberto Mancini that he should be welcomed back from the international wilderness. The Azzurri ended up paying the price for a lack of firepower in their ranks, with a dramatic stoppage-time goal seeing them suffer a shock play-off semi-final defeat to North Macedonia that means they will be sitting out a second successive World Cup.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/balotelli-another-face-tattoo-mb459-inked-below-eye/blt9b38e392404da821,Chris Burton,93c64c5a-fb05-4fc7-b61c-9942b6611201
George Clooney admits to being Derby County fan as Championship club edge closer to new ownership,"George Clooney has admitted to being a Derby County fan as the Championship club edge closer to a change in ownership. The Rams have endured a turbulent 2021-22 campaign and currently sit rock bottom of the Championship, having been docked a total of 21 points after entering into administration. Bidders are currently being identified to complete a takeover at Pride Park, with club administrators Quantum set to analyse the proposals on the table before the end of the month, and A-list Hollywood actor Clooney could be among those in the running. The 60-year-old, who has starred in popular films such as Ocean's Eleven and Gravity, says he has been following Derby ever since being given a crash course on the club by fellow actor Jack O'Connell while on the set of 'Money Monster' in 2016. ""I was introduced to the Rams by Jack O'Connell a few years ago when we were making a movie together. He was so passionate about his team and has followed Derby County all his life,"" Clooney said in an exclusive interview with Derbyshire Life. ""I asked him a few questions and there was no stopping him - he really loves the club and knows so much about it. I had to admire that and listening to the club's history was quite intriguing and fired my¬†imagination.¬† ""I watched a few games on TV and gradually I began to understand soccer better and began to look out for Derby County's games and results. I have been watching ever since."" The American film icon has also been keeping a close eye on the Rams' off-field issues amid reports that he is interested in buying the club. Clooney stopped short of confirming those rumours, but expressed his belief that Derby have a bright future ahead of them once their financial situation is resolved. ""Derby has a great football club with a fantastic history and I am sure there is a great future too,"" he added. ""I know that there have been problems in recent times but nothing that cannot be fixed and under the circumstances, the team has been working really hard and playing well. ¬† ""It‚Äôs obvious to me looking on that as well as the players on the pitch, the fans have played their part too."" Clooney's interest in football has stemmed from his admiration for the huge following the sport generates in England. He admits that the United States cannot match their cousins across the pond for ""passion"" with regards to following their chosen teams. ""I love the passion of sport,"" said Clooney. ""In the States there is a great following for all sports, whether that be (American)¬†football, baseball, ice hockey or anything else. ¬† ""The crowds are big and make a lot of noise but the passion of British soccer fans takes loyalty to a club onto a higher level. I think, in part, that is what made me start to take notice of soccer.¬† ""I have worked with quite a few British football fans and their moods were often dependent¬†on how well their favourite soccer team had performed in their latest game. ¬† ""I found it quite curious and wanted to know what made that happen. Nobody wants to see their team lose but it seemed that British football fans were much more involved in the importance of the result."" Whether or not Clooney formalises his interest in Derby will become clear in the coming days, with the club having released a statement confirming that they are now reaching the end of their process to select a preferred bidder. ""The joint administrators will assess the merits of all bids received over the weekend of 26/27 March and will identify their preferred bidder,"" the statement released on Friday reads. ""This will be the bid which we feel best secures the long term future of the Club. ""Early next week the joint administrators will commence discussions with the EFL. Further to their approval to proceed, we will then be in a position to publicly name the preferred bidder.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/george-clooney-admits-to-being-derby-county-fan-as/blt976d07d02d2cd340,James Westwood,4e7aec97-cba6-4f69-8a44-bcdb6b289888
"'Shame' Neymar, Mbappe & Messi only now at 100 per cent, says PSG's Brazil star","Neymar said that it's a ""shame"" that he, Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi have only just reached 100 per cent after the Paris Saint-Germain front three's stellar showing against Clermont Foot. PSG romped to a 6-1 win at the Stade Gabriel-Montpied on Sunday night, with Neymar and Mbappe both grabbing hat-tricks as Mauricio Pochettino's side moved 12 points clear at the top of Ligue 1. Messi also recorded three assists in the match and, although Neymar was happy with their latest display, he regrets the fact it's taken so long for the trio to combine to maximum effect. All three men have faced criticism in 2021-22 as PSG have suffered early exits in both the Champions League and French Cup. Neymar says they are now fully motivated to end the season on a high by capturing the Ligue 1 crown, though, as he told reporters following the Clermont win: ""First of all, I'm happy to have won tonight. I'm also happy to have scored three goals.  ""We're getting better and better. All three of us are at 100% but only at the end of the season.  ""It's a shame for us but we're going to get what we have left in the league."" Mbappe echoed Neymar's sentiments when speaking to Canal+, as he added: ""Yes, it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs only happening now, but then there were a fair amount of circumstances and events that meant we were delayed. But we feel that we‚Äôre three quality players and we're trying to help the team as much as possible. That‚Äôs what happened today."" On regrets over not clicking together earlier, he added: ""That‚Äôs life. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. You have to keep looking forward, it‚Äôs in the past now. We had some pain, which is still present, but you need to keep positive. We have to show that we‚Äôre a big club and a big team and that we‚Äôre here to win trophies.‚Äù Mbappe's latest treble saw him move on to 31 goals from 39 appearances in all competitions this season, including 20 in Ligue 1 as he now leads the race for the Golden Boot, and also has 22 assists to his name. Neymar has hit 10 goals in 16 less games than Mbappe, having spent a large portion of the campaign on the sidelines due to injury, while Messi has been the least prolific of the three forwards. The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner has only scored eight goals in 27 outings for PSG to date, having joined the club on a free transfer following his surprise departure from Barcelona last summer, but has also set up 13 Ligue 1 goals.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/shame-neymar-mbappe-and-messi-only-now-at-100-per-cent-says/blt015928fe336875e1,James Westwood,08d4251f-6e49-4bb3-8091-ce04443b849f
Which international team will Anthony Elanga play for? Man Utd forward's eligibility explained,"Anthony Elanga joined the Manchester United academy ranks back in 2014, and made his competitive senior debut seven years later in a Premier League clash with Leicester City. The forward scored his first goal for the club on the final day of the 2020-21 campaign against Wolves and established himself as a regular in 2021-22, recording three goals in 15 appearances, but who will he represent at international level? GOAL takes a look at Elanga's eligibility and the teams he could play for. Elanga is eligible to play for three international teams: Sweden, Cameroon and England. He was born in Malmo, Sweden on April 27, 2002, and, as a Swedish citizen, is thus eligible to play for the Scandinavian nation if selected. The Red Devils forward is also eligible to represent Cameroon, the country his father Joseph Elanga was born in and played for during his own career. He can also potentially play for England, should he take up British citizenship, having lived in Manchester for the past eight years. Elanga has represented Sweden at U17, U19 and U21 levels, but has never played for Cameroon or England. He looks set to continue playing for Sweden after receiving his first senior international call-up in March 2022. Elanga was included in Sweden's World Cup 2022 play-offs squad alongside the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Dejan Kulusevski.

Current FIFA rules dictate that any player can switch national teams once if they choose to do so and meet the required criteria in terms of citizenship and eligibility. It used to be the case that players who had played a senior competitive game for one nation could not switch to play for another country, but a 2020 change to the regulations saw the number of matches raised to three. Elanga may have played for Sweden at youth level but he is still awaiting his first set of senior caps and is, therefore, also still free to be called up by Cameroon and England. However, it has been reported that the forward has little interest in playing for any other nation than Sweden and the English FA have no plans to try and 'poach' him, while Cameroon have also yet to indicate any interest in convincing him to consider a change in allegiance.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/which-international-team-will-anthony-elanga-play-for-man/blt345a43ee940b5e1c,James Westwood,f5c91c6d-790d-485d-ac73-d04c6c630faa
2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Cameroon showed they are indomitable against Algeria ‚Äì Song,"Cameroon coach Rigobert Song has thanked his players for the solid display that saw them defeat Algeria 2-1 and qualify for the World Cup finals in Qatar. The Indomitable Lions went into the game having lost the first leg meeting 1-0 at Douala Stadium and they took a deserved through Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting in the 22nd minute. However, Algeria pulled a goal back in the 118th minute (in extra time) courtesy of Ahmed Touba, and in the stoppages; Cameroon broke the hearts of the North African side when Karl Toko Ekambi slammed home from close range for a 2-2 draw on aggregate. The result meant Cameroon qualified on the away goals rule. Song, who was handling his second game for the side, believes they had defeated a very defensive Algerian side. ‚ÄúI would like to congratulate both teams for this game, and my players who showed that they were indomitable,‚Äù Song said after the game as quoted by Actu Cameroun. ‚ÄúIn the first game, we were put in difficulty by a defensive team which prevented the players from expressing themselves offensively. Today [Tuesday], we knew how to work against that with a two-forward system.‚Äù Ekambi, who plays for Ligue 1 club Olympique Lyonnais and scored the winner, believes Cameroon deserved to earn the World Cup ticket. ‚ÄúThese kind of matches between two teams are played on the details,‚Äù Ekambi said as quoted by the same portal. ‚ÄúAlgeria lacked efficiency and we were able to take advantage of this set piece. ‚ÄúI thank Algeria for its warm welcome.

Which national team will Eddie Nketiah play for? Arsenal star's eligibility options explained,"Eddie Nketiah saw his stock soar in the 2021-22 season after scoring vital goals for Arsenal in their bid to secure Champions League football.  The 22-year-old spent his youth career playing for both Chelsea and Arsenal before ultimately signing on as a professional in the red side of London in 2017.  Nketiah has already represented one of his nations at the youth level and scored an abundance of goals doing so, though that was not enough to earn him a place in the senior level.  So, which nations can Nketiah play for, and which team will he represent? GOAL takes a look. Nketiah is eligible to play for both England and Ghana. London born and raised, his British citizenship makes him eligible to play for the Three Lions, and he has already done so at youth level.  On March 22, 2017, Nketiah earned his international debut for England at U18 level, playing against Saudi Arabia U19. In the 58th minute, he scored England's second goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory. Then, in October 2020, Nketiah broke Alan Shearer's record by scoring in a 2-1 victory over Turkey to become England U21's all-time leading goalscorer. Qualification secured ‚úÖAll time U21 Record broken‚úÖNight to remember, God is good üôèüèæ üìû@England pic.twitter.com/elWM4dUHbd Meanwhile, Nketiah‚Äôs background has allowed him to be granted a Ghanaian passport, making him eligible to represent the nation, though he has thus far turned down offers to do so.  Despite previously dismissing the opportunity to play for Ghana, it now appears that the Arsenal forward will declare his football allegiance, according to football.london.  Nketiah, whose family has previously been approached by the Ghanaian football association on a number of occasions, appears to have been persuaded to represent the West African nation as the 2022 World Cup approaches. With the likes of Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, and Phil Foden, among others, operating in England's forward line, a chance to play in the World Cup may be much more viable with Ghana than with England for Nketiah, given the competitive landscape posed by The Three Lions. Footballers are generally allowed to request one change of national association under FIFA's national team eligibility rules, though reversals can be facilitated in particular circumstances. Article 8 of the FIFA Statutes lays out the rules for changing associations. Players who wish to change national teams must formally request a change from FIFA, and their case is then reviewed by the Players Status Committee. However, because Nketiah has yet to represent England at the senior level, this process may be relatively straightforward for the 22-year-old",https://www.goal.com/en/news/which-national-team-eddie-nketiah-play-arsenal-stars-eligibility-/blta41b838ef3df41c7,Nick Khairi,c2cf5879-8bc8-426d-8b12-09bb57faf0d6
Which football teams do Premier League referees support?,"Premier League referees require thick skin, as they are never going to please everybody all of the time, and an ability to appear almost robotic needs to be picked up en route to the top ‚Äì especially in an era when VAR has added to the melting pot of questionable decisions and fan frustration. Many officials, though, are boyhood football supporters that have reached the highest level down a different path to the established playing track, with plenty having a specific team that they consider to be a favourite. Who are these sides and which of the men in the middle are known to have allegiances to specific clubs in English football ‚Äì with accusations of favouritism and bias never far away from those taking on one of the toughest jobs in the game? GOAL takes a look... There are a number of Premier League officials that have never revealed their ties to any one club in public, which could be considered a safe choice given the pressure they operate under. Plenty of others have, however, been happy to openly nail their colours to a particular mast.

""They complete a form that includes who they support, the history of if they've played the game and with the addresses where they are residing.

Beckham's former Inter Miami coach was born to lead: Meet new Uruguay boss Diego Alonso,"New Uruguay coach Diego Alonso faces a baptism of fire in his first months on the Celeste bench. Not only is the former Inter Miami boss replacing a legend of the Uruguayan game, in the shape of Oscar Tabarez, but he begins his reign with four crucial World Cup qualifiers which will define whether the nation makes it to the finals after qualifying for the last three editions under El Maestro's steady gaze. It would be a stiff challenge for any trainer, but Alonso has at least shown that he can come through and get results when it most counts. He was a solid if unspectacular forward during his playing days, best known for netting six goals for Valencia during their run to the Champions League final in 2000-01 and taking the Segunda Division's top scorer title the following season as he guided Atletico Madrid back to the top flight. Alonso hung up his boots at Penarol in 2011 ‚Äì having just missed out on the Copa Libertadores title against Neymar's Santos ‚Äì and turned his hand to coaching. Middling spells in his native Uruguay and Paraguay led to his appointment by Mexico's Pachuca, where he lifted the club's first national title for nine years in the 2016 Clausura and followed that up with victory in the CONCACAF Champions League the following year. In 2018, now at the helm of Monterrey, he repeated that feat, winning the final against none other than the Rayados' arch-rivals Tigres to become the first-ever coach to lift the title with two different teams. Even with that impressive record of success, Alonso was nevertheless a surprise choice for Inter Miami owner David Beckham when the ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid ace unveiled his new MLS franchise for the 2020 season. The decision owed much to the influence of ex-Atlanta United vice-president, Inter's sporting director Paul McDonough, who was bowled over by the performance of the Uruguayan's Monterrey team in taking down Atlanta in the CONCACAF Champions League. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs competed against MLS teams in the Concacaf Champions League, and I paid close attention when his team was beating Atlanta United,‚Äù McDonough explained to the Miami Herald upon hiring Alonso. ‚ÄúAll the MLS teams aspire to win that, and we just signed a guy who has won it twice with two different clubs.‚Äù Alonso, meanwhile, eagerly awaited the chance to shine under Beckham, having clashed with the ex-Madrid man in La Liga as a Malaga player. His first and only season in Florida, however, proved a tough prospect. Amid the huge interruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the natural growing pains of steering a new franchise through their opening games ‚Äì Inter's roster was still coming together in 2020. Highly-paid marquee stars such as Gonzalo Higuain and Blaise Matuidi were absent for much of the year and Alonso returned seven wins in 23 games to secure a play-off berth in the Eastern Conference, where they suffered resounding defeat to Nashville to put an end to the term. Beckham had observed from afar throughout 2020 due to the difficulties posed by Covid, but his adoption of a more hands-on role at the start of this year had immediate implications for his coach. Alonso found himself out of a job in January in favour of the Londoner's old United team-mate Phil Neville, but perhaps took some consolation in the fact that while he squeezed Inter into the play-offs his replacement fell short, finishing a lowly 11th in the 2021 campaign. The 46-year-old's appointment by Uruguay, his first job since leaving Miami, represents a balance being struck on the part of the Celeste between continuity and innovation. Exceptional River Plate boss Marcelo Gallardo had been identified as the nation's first choice, but the Argentine always appeared an outside bet, and buried any prospect of his crossing the Rio de la Plata in December when he committed to his current employers for at least until the end of 2022. With Gallardo out of the running, Uruguay were expected by many to turn to the perceived safe hands of Diego Aguirre, Tabarez's old protege at Penarol and in the Celeste set-up and equipped with vast experience across the world of football. Aguirre, however, has done precious little in the 10 years since he took former charge Alonso and Penarol to the 2011 Libertadores final to show he merits a chance at the highest level. The coach has travelled widely in the past decade, taking jobs in Qatar, Brazil and Argentina, but a handful of trophies in the Middle East with Al-Rayyan and one Gaucho State Championship for Internacional hardly represents an overwhelming title haul in return. His last job, once again at Internacional, ended in dismissal this month after failing to lead the club into the Libertadores. Alonso is hardly a leap into the unknown for Uruguay. Like Tabarez he favours structured, no-frills football, building from the back and refraining from unnecessary risks. He is also a tireless student of the game, meticulous in his preparations and who revels in the profession and the challenges it presents. ‚ÄúI enjoyed my playing career, knowing all along that coaching was my passion,‚Äù he confided to the Coaches' Voice. ‚ÄúWhenever I‚Äôm asked, I always say that I was lucky enough to be a manager who also got to play football.‚Äù At 46, though, Alonso is also a fresh face who can inject dynamism into a Uruguay team which has the talent to break out of its current funk and make it to Qatar. His first two matches in charge, against Paraguay and Venezuela, mark a relatively kind introduction to the rigours of the CONMEBOL qualifiers; and if he can secure positive results the quest to make the finals might not be doomed just yet.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/beckham-s-former-inter-miami-coach-was-born-to-lead-meet-new/blt85c3990861267a05,Daniel Edwards,504fa55e-4a60-47f1-a7e6-ba3268dff649
Abramovich has been forced out of Chelsea - Are Man City and Newcastle's owners next?,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shone a spotlight on international funding in the United Kingdom, with sport a particularly visible and prominent vehicle of investment. Oligarchs and wealthy Russians close to Vladimir Putin have been sanctioned by the UK government and the ownership of Chelsea made Roman Abramovich the highest-profile case. With assets frozen, the club's existence was under threat and only a special licence allowed the men's and women's teams to continue playing. However, we are now moving towards the final stages of a takeover, which is being overseen by Raine Group, and there are at least four bidders in the mix. Of course, Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003, has been blocked from benefiting financially from the sale. The billionaire faced sporadic criticism about his links to the Kremlin during almost two decades at Stamford Bridge, but was still free to invest as much money as he pleased in Chelsea, who won five Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues during his stewardship. However, the Premier League has now come under pressure to expand its criteria for assessing prospective owners, particularly in relation to human rights. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking to see if more tests need to be added, if we need to be more transparent and whether those decisions should be approved by an independent body,‚Äù Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said at the recent Financial Times Business of Sport Summit. Roman Abramovich has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea by the Premier League. While there has always been scepticism surrounding the motives and practices of several American investors, the biggest political and moral objections have been made in relation to Middle Eastern involvement. For example, Amnesty International renewed calls for a human rights-compliant owners' and directors' test following the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Public Investment Fund. Its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been accused of presiding over a regime that has led a coalition in the long-running armed conflict in Yemen, as well as instigating a major human rights crackdown. Other Gulf states have invested heavily in sport, including 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which have both been condemned for their human rights records. Manchester City owner and UAE deputy prime minister Sheikh Mansour has spent more than ¬£1 billion ($1.3bn) turning the club into one of the most successful in the world. However, Labour MP Chris Bryant, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, questioned if he was a ""fit and proper person to be owning a football club"". Despite criticism, the UAE has also fostered close ties with the UK, which makes any potential intervention difficult. Indeed, in September, the UAE announced a ¬£10bn investment partnership with the UK government on technology, infrastructure, and energy transition. ""The British government actively encourages investment from the Middle East ‚Äì it has done for a long time,"" Geopolitical Economy of Sport expert Professor Simon Chadwick tells GOAL. ""In terms of business and lucrative sources of revenue, we know that the likes of Saudi Arabia and others spend lots of money on, for instance, weapons. ""Post-Brexit, the British government has obviously had to plug some gaps in terms of trade relationships and inward investment. ""And, over the last two or three years in particular, the British government has really doubled down on its selling in the Gulf region. ""In the main, the relationship is reasonably good without being exceptionally good. There are some issues. ""One thinks particularly¬†of the scrutiny that the ruling family in Dubai have recently had in the treatment of some of their female family members. ""But there has also been some outcry from Britain regarding the war in Yemen."" A recent meeting between Sheikh Mansour and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad drew comment with a Foreign Office spokesperson saying such meetings ""undermine the prospect"" of peace in Syria, where a civil war has been fought for 11 years. The UAE has also so far remained neutral over Russia's invasion of Ukraine despite pressure from the United States and Europe. ""Whilst the UAE will not want to disaffect Europe and the West, it will equally not want to disaffect Russia either,"" Chadwick adds. ""They're going to hedge and wait and see before they make a decision. ""Whilst we're expecting Abu Dhabi to support Europe and the United States, they've also got to try to protect themselves as well. ""They are acutely aware that literally a matter of tens of miles across the Persian Gulf, they have Iran ‚Äì a big ally of Russia and also a serial provocateur in the region. ""It's a dangerous part of the world and you can imagine the UAE trying to position themselves as intermediaries in the debate between Russia and the West."" Sport has helped promote UAE on the world stage. Abu Dhabi hosted last year's Cricket World Cup, as well as the engrossing final race of the 2021 Formula One season. Emirati citizens have also played a major role in transforming horse racing in the UK. Football, of course, has been the UAE's most visible marketing tool, with the Dubai government‚Äôs Investment Corporation-owned airline Emirates sponsoring Arsenal‚Äôs stadium, the FA Cup, Real Madrid and Chelsea amongst others. The City Football Group, in which Silver Lake and China Media Capital now have significant minor shareholdings, has Manchester City as its jewel and contains 10 clubs across the world including a foothold in potentially major markets in New York, China and India. Accusations of 'sportswashing' ‚Äì the practice of using sport to clean a tarnished reputation or public image ‚Äì has often been touted as one of the driving factors behind Middle Eastern investment. OFFICIAL: Newcastle United‚Äôs Saudi Arabia-backed takeover has been completed üí∞ pic.twitter.com/epraQN17ue However, Professor Chadwick believes that financial benefits and an increase in soft power are bigger motivating factors. ""If you look at the national development strategies of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, the national development strategies of these countries are centred upon generating incomes from overseas investment projects,"" he says. ""They are about positioning themselves as important members of the global sporting community, diversifying their economies away from a dependence on oil and gas. ""It's about affecting societal change, for instance, by promoting gender equality through sport. ""It is also about projecting soft power and that's an attractive power because it's essentially about trying to engage overseas audiences with who you are and what you do, and trying to persuade other nations that you want the same things as they do. ""Many people in the Gulf region would see this as soft power projection, not as sportswashing. I think sportswashing is simply a lens through which some nations view what is happening in these countries. ""That lens is obviously one which casts the likes of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia as using sport negatively, for divisive and possibly even destructive reasons. ""I'm not discounting the possibility that this is the case. However, I do think there is more to what is happening in these countries than simply trying to convince the world that they're good guys."" Whatever the truth, one thing is clear: there is now greater scrutiny than ever before on where the money is coming from in English football.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-abramovich-english-football-man-city-newcastle-next/bltc26632032a17da4e,Jonathan Smith,771482e9-5f2d-4a0b-873c-bc449ead22d8
World Cup: Why Ghana vs Uruguay is not about revenge - Paintsil,"Ghana must not focus their attention on the game against Uruguay alone if they aim to qualify for the knockout round of the 2022 Fifa World Cup, according to Black Stars legend John Paintsil. In the draw conducted recently, the West Africans were zoned in Group H alongside the South Americans, Portugal and South Korea. To many, the fixture against Uruguay is a good opportunity for the four-time African champions to avenge their quarter-final defeat to the Sky Blue at the 2010 World Cup. There, Asamoah Gyan missed from the penalty spot after Luis Suarez prevented an obvious goalscoring opportunity with his hand. With the score tied at 1-1 after extra-time, Milovan Rajevac‚Äôs men crashed out 4-2 on penalties. Nevertheless, the ex-Fulham and West Ham United defender revealed Otto Addo‚Äôs team must not afford to focus on the Uruguayans only. ""The game that is going to be mouth-watering and that people will be looking forward to is Uruguay-Ghana, because of the incident that happened in 2010 in South Africa,"" Paintsil told BBC Sport Africa. ""As football people, we don't think about revenge - but we always thought about how we can go forward. ""At the end of the day, it is not only Uruguay that we will play in the group. If you beat Uruguay but don't beat the rest, it will be a problem."" Accessing Ghana‚Äôs chances to qualify for the Round of 16 judging by the quality of teams they have been zoned against, the 40-year-old said his country has been put in the ‚Äògroup of death‚Äô, however, he fancies their prospects of qualifying. ""I would call it a group of death,"" he continued. ¬†""Seeing Portugal, Uruguay, Ghana and South Korea... all strong sides. We are going to take one [game] at a time and take it as it comes. ¬†""We are not just going to say 'because we are in a group with Uruguay, we will put all our strength on them'. ‚ÄúWe need to put all our strength on all the teams that we are going to play so we can come out of the group successfully. ""I believe our current squad is a very balanced one, with youth and experience. ""The two matches they played against Nigeria gave all of us hope that they can go further.

GOAL was able to confirm earlier in the summer that a five-time Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner had requested a move elsewhere as he, at 37 years of age, remains eager to grace a Champions League stage and compete for major honours. On this day in 2003, Cristiano Ronaldo signed for Manchester United. If only they could go back to those days now ü•∫ pic.twitter.com/MU4TYi5UM5 United appear unable to deliver on either front at present and Neville fears there could be further regression to come, with a man that won 20 trophies during his playing days telling Sky Sports: ‚ÄúThere's a massive decision to make on Cristiano Ronaldo, and they're damned if they do and damned if they don't. ‚ÄúBefore these two results, I said that the best thing to do is to facilitate a move out of the club for Cristiano, and the club are not happy with him. ‚ÄúThe problem now is that if they lose him, there's nothing left for the club in the goalscoring part of the pitch. ‚ÄúI genuinely think that if they don't bring players in in the next couple of weeks - or if they bring poor players in and he leaves - they could finish in the bottom half of the table. ‚ÄúThey're a bottom-half-of-the-table team. That's a massive statement and I might look stupid at the end of the season. ‚ÄúUnited will ride the wave over the next few months and get through this season but they're going to have live through the rockiest times they've had since they got relegated [in 1974].‚Äù Erik ten Hag is the first Manchester United manager to lose his opening two league games in 20 years üòµ pic.twitter.com/hYJ62ixVm6 Neville has continued to take aim at the Glazer family and their role as owners of United during a period of serious struggle for the Red Devils, but he concedes that recruitment business has also been to blame for a painful tumble from the loftiest of perches for the 13-time Premier League champions. He added when casting an eye over the players brought in across the last decade: ‚ÄúOne of the problems Manchester United have had for 10 years is that they‚Äôve flip-flopped between managers and strategies. That‚Äôs been a massive issue. ‚ÄúWe did a little exercise where we looked at major signings at the club over the last 10 years, removing players like third goalkeepers. We removed some of the younger players but ¬£1.25bn has been spent. ‚ÄúWe think there are only two signings, at this moment in time, that have been good value and have performed at a level. Bruno Fernandes has gone off the boil a bit but, because of the numbers he‚Äôs hit over two seasons, you have to say he worked ‚Äì and [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic has worked. ‚Äú[Ander] Herrera, [Luke] Shaw, [Nemanja] Matic, [Juan] Mata‚Ä¶ Ronaldo would have been a green but because of what‚Äôs happened over the last month, with him wanting to leave and the confusion, the stories that have happened, that has to make him an amber. It might be because of their performance, value, price tag or just their behaviour. ‚Äú75 per cent have not worked. 20 per cent are amber. Only four or five per cent have worked; that‚Äôs a horror show from a recruitment point of view. ‚ÄúI know that there‚Äôs a big call for blaming the players and we‚Äôve blamed the players a lot. I was excited about a lot of those signings, even last year with [Jadon] Sancho, [Raphael] Varane and Ronaldo ‚Äì great signings. When [Angel] Di Maria came, we thought, ‚Äòthis will be a signing‚Äô. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs become a graveyard for football players, this football club. Players are now even considering whether they want to come to the club; you can‚Äôt get players in.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bottom-half-if-ronaldo-goes-mess-man-utd-drastic-prediction/blt3b8f48d8a6d1c968,Chris Burton,2b262516-1624-4625-a62f-9929c350922d
"Real Madrid vs Espanyol: Predictions, odds & betting tips","Real Madrid aim to be crowned champions of La Liga on Saturday when they welcome Espanyol to the Santiago Bernabeu. Los Blancos will win the title if they avoid defeat and, despite being likely to field a weakened side ahead of their Champions League semi-final second leg on Wednesday, Madrid remain clear favourites. Carlo Ancelotti's side have lost just one league game at home all season and are offered at 9/20 (1.45) with bet365 to wrap up the title in style. A point would also be enough for Madrid to be champions and the draw is priced at 10/3 (4.33) while the visitors are priced at 6/1 (7.00) to claim their first win at the Bernabeu since 1996. Karim Benzema looks set to be rested for the game which should give a chance to Mariano Diaz to lead the line with the former Lyon forward offered at 4/1 (5.00) to break the deadlock. Luka Jovic has been struggling with an injury but could also be given some minutes and he is offered at 10/3 (4.33), while Gareth Bale can be backed at 5/1 (6.00). Espanyol's top scorer is former Real Madrid striker Raul De Tomas who is available at 13/2 (7.50) to open the scoring. The hosts will surely be holding plenty back for the visit of Manchester City on Wednesday but will feel they are more than capable of claiming a draw against an Espanyol team with nothing to play for. Los Pericos are all but mathematically safe from relegation and treading water in mid-table, while their away form in La Liga is dreadful, having claimed just one win in their last 25 matches. The Catalans have though scored in seven of their last eight matches on the road and, with Madrid set to field a second string XI, Espanyol will feel they can get on the scoresheet. Both teams to score has paid out in nine of Espanyol's last 14 away league matches and is priced at 4/5 (1.80), while backing Madrid to win and concede is available at 21/10 (3.10).

'Dembele must stay!' - Barcelona beg for new contract as winger equals Messi's assist mark in win,"Ousmane Dembele must stay with Barcelona, says Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who spoke of the Frenchman's impact after the Blaugrana emerged as 3-2 winners against Levante in La Liga on Sunday. The Catalan outfit fought back from behind to seize the lead through the latter, lost it again to a third penalty for their hosts and then snatched the win in injury time through Luuk de Jong's effort. It marked another impressive turn for Dembele however, who as recently as January looked set to become a Camp Nou outcast - and now Aubameyang, who bagged Barcelona's first goal, says that he should renew past this year rather than move onto new pastures. ""Ousmane knows me well,"" the Gabon star told Movistar+. ""I have to always be prepared when he goes to the right. ""It's normal for people to be aware of me. I can do much more. In the first half I didn't play well. We have to [show] a little more intensity. ""I think today we lowered the intensity, especially in the first half. We improved in the second half.

The forward remains impressed with the duo, adding: ""Pedri and Gavi have done very well. We trust the whole group. Those who have entered have scored goals. It was a very difficult match.""

Arteta out or trust the process? Arsenal‚Äôs collapse sparks familiar debate,"A quick glance at social media in the hours following Arsenal‚Äôs defeat at Newcastle on Monday night was all you would have needed to get a sense of the scale of disappointment amongst the club‚Äôs fanbase. Almost immediately, ‚ÄòArteta Out‚Äô was trending, as is often the way after a poor result. Arsenal‚Äôs manager has made some big strides this season in his attempts to bring the club back together after such a difficult few years, but the fall out created by the back-to-back defeats against Tottenham and Newcastle shows that some division still exists. So too did the reaction to the news that Arteta had been handed a new three-year contract by the club earlier this month. While the majority of Arsenal fans were happy that the club had tied the Spaniard down to a new deal, there were some who were confused by the timing of the announcement, given the season had yet to reach its conclusion. And those supporters who questioned the wisdom of awarding Arteta a new deal without a top-four spot having been secured have been quick to voice their discontent following the last two defeats which have all but ended Arsenal‚Äôs hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. When asked whether this season will now be viewed as a missed opportunity, should Spurs get the point they need at Norwich this weekend to secure fourth spot, Arteta said: ‚ÄúIt will be for sure because we were there and mathematically it was in our hands. ‚ÄúThat feeling could be there if it happens, and it will take some time to go away.¬† ‚ÄúBut that is part of football and you cannot take notice of what happened a week or two weeks ago whether it was positive or negative.‚Äù The debate over Arteta is nothing new.¬† It‚Äôs something that has gone hand in hand with the Arsenal manager since he was appointed. Two successive eighth-placed finishes in the Premier League have ensured there are plenty who feel he is not the right man to take the club forward and those detractors remain, even though the Gunners can finish no lower than fifth this time around. But is that fair? At the start of the season, few would have given Arsenal any hope of going on to secure a top-four spot, especially after they opened the campaign with three straight defeats and went into the first international break bottom of the table without having even scored a goal. Internally, the club‚Äôs target was to finish in the top six and bring European football back to Emirates Stadium - something Arteta has achieved comfortably. So in that context, he has achieved exactly what he had been asked to do. And there is no doubt he has created an atmosphere around the club that hasn‚Äôt existed for a long time. While his detractors may continue to vent their frustrations on social media, the support Arteta has received from Arsenal‚Äôs fans inside stadiums this season - both home and away - has been huge. And even if results do go the way they are expected to this weekend and Arsenal do finish fifth, it would be no surprise to hear Arteta‚Äôs name sung loudly by supporters inside the Emirates during the game against Everton on Sunday. üí¨ ""We're going to be cheering for Norwich and after that, we're going to take this club to the next level.""A few words from the boss ahead of our final pre-match press conference of the season üëá #ARSEVE | @M8Arteta pic.twitter.com/dH3ZTI1ps9 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long journey and a very challenging one this season,‚Äù Arteta admitted, ahead of the game. ‚ÄúBut I think that we have come a long way as a club and as a team. I think we have transformed the energy, the vibe and expectation of this football club again.¬† ‚ÄúWe've done it together, showing incredible unity between the staff, the players, everybody in the club, and especially with our people, which has been incredibly supportive throughout the season, especially in difficult moments.‚Äù It‚Äôs clear that Arteta does still have the support of the majority of match-going fans. The Spaniard has urged supporters to ‚Äòtrust the process‚Äô since he first arrived and has consistently warned that there is no quick fix to the problems that have plagued Arsenal in recent years. There are many who are happy with the decisions he‚Äôs made, such as getting rid of the club‚Äôs high earners and building a hungry squad of young players, many of which have come through the academy. And for large spells this season, there have been obvious signs of improvement on the pitch - although a lack of goals continues to be a problem. Arteta‚Äôs detractors point to his decision to let star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leave in January without signing a replacement as a major reason for their failure to get over the line in the race for the top four. But Arsenal‚Äôs manager remains unmoved in the face of that criticism. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, when asked earlier this week if he had got things wrong in January. ‚ÄúEverything that we did do, was trying to reach the objectives that we had after January ‚Äì which was to try to be challenging the top four. ‚ÄúAnd financially to be stable and in a position that come the summer we could do certain things and not be completely locked."" Inside the club, Arteta still has the full support of the hierarchy and there is no chance of him being replaced this summer. That is why he was handed a new contract earlier this month and the disappointing end to the season will not change how he is viewed internally. There is an understanding that the rebuild is far from complete and there will be some significant business done in the transfer window, even if Arsenal do miss out on the Champions League. And that is what Arteta wants to focus on.¬† ‚ÄúWe want to take the club to the next level,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat's the ambition.¬† ‚ÄúIn order to do that we have a very clear plan again in how we want to do and execute it. There are no secrets. We need to increase the quality and the depth of the squad. ‚ÄúWe are going to have certain resources, not unlimited resources, some resources. And with our resources we have to do what we have to do in the best possible way.‚Äù Whatever happens during Sunday‚Äôs season finale, the debate over Arteta will continue throughout the summer. The 40-year-old has worked hard to bring the club together again following his arrival and, even though he has had some success with that, there is still a long way to go before everyone comes on board. He is well aware that success on the pitch is the only way to do that and, although there has been progress this season, it has not been big enough to silence all of his doubters. The reaction to the defeats at Tottenham and Newcastle is proof of that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arteta-out-or-trust-the-process-arsenal-collapse-sparks-familiar-/blt1c3d1f15fe40376f,Charles Watts,53cf4248-3f30-40d8-8d7e-aff2b949be08
Arsenal's season has fallen apart - is there any way for Arteta to save their top-four hopes?,"We all know things change quickly in football, but only at Arsenal does optimism turn to pessimism at quite such an alarming speed. In mid-March, Arsenal were fourth, one point above Manchester United with three games in hand - and six points clear of their most likely rivals for the Champions League spot, Tottenham, with two games in hand. Four defeats in the last five, however, has seen that lead evaporate. The Gunners are currently sixth, with one game in hand - Wednesday's clash with Chelsea - left to draw level with fourth-placed Spurs on 57 points. A young team in perfect balance, fizzing through matches, has become flat and lifeless overnight. All talk of Mikel Arteta having finally cracked it has gone out the window, with Arsenal seemingly right back where they were at the start of the season. Of course, the reality is that both the optimism and the pessimism are too extreme. Arsenal are still moving in the right direction and such a young team is more vulnerable than most to bouts of poor form; this will keep happening, and supporters ought not to panic too much.¬† Nevertheless there are tactical concerns arising from this run of defeats that need addressing. By and large it comes down to the north London outfit losing two of their best players to injury - Thomas Partey and Kieran Tierney - and needing an upgrade in the centre-forward position.¬† Partey has become the most important player in the Arsenal team, not only for his capacity to anticipate opposition counterattacks and shut them down, but for his press-resistance at the base of midfield.¬† To illustrate the point, Arsenal have won 44 points from the 22 Premier League games that Partey has started this season, and 10 points from the nine games he has not. This is hardly surprising. The modern Premier League is all about the transitions; preventing opposition breaks and creating scenarios in which the hard-pressing of the opposition can be used to your advantage by moving vertically through the lines. That is why Rodri and Fabinho are so vital at Manchester City and Liverpool, respectively, and why a player like Declan Rice is in such high demand. Arsenal, lacking a player in this mould for over a decade, have excelled recently as Partey injected verticality and defensive battling into their midfield. Without him, though, many parts of Arteta's system collapse. Firstly, they are worse defensively without Partey's acceleration into challenges and 50-50s, as evidenced in the recent defeats to Brighton and Southampton.¬† But it is on the ball that the Ghana international makes the biggest difference. When he is not there, Arsenal move back to sideways possession without purpose, struggling to cut through the opposition defence with line-splitting passes.¬† It is no coincidence that in his absence, Arsenal have held more possession than usual (65% and 71% in their last two games), but rarely looked like scoring. Partey's skills also mean Arsenal have been able to move into a 4-3-3 formation, with the ex-Atletico Madrid star anchoring alone, in turn releasing Martin Odegaard and Granit Xhaka to play higher up the pitch and connect to the forwards. Again, this made Arsenal more creative and vertical. But without Partey, Arsenal's more creative players are having to come deeper to help out; Arthur Lokonga has needed Odegaard to move alongside him, creating gaps that prevent the brilliant combinations ‚Äì Emile Smith Rowe to Odegaard, Odegaard to Saka ‚Äì we had been seeing recently. But Partey's absence cannot explain everything. After all, Arsenal were already 2-0 down to Crystal Palace when he suffered his injury, with Wilfried Zaha winning a penalty to make it 3-0 after robbing a clearly impeded Partey in midfield. Tierney, meanwhile, has been missing for every minute of this three-game losing streak and, as with his absence last season, it has revealed the importance of Arsenal having a strong left side to counter-balance the right. Arsenal have a recent history of leaning too heavily to the right, expecting Saka ‚Äì now with Odegaard ‚Äì to create the vast majority of their chances. They need Tierney's driving runs from the left to balance things out, otherwise it becomes too easy for opponents to focus on the one dangerous flank. Defensively, Arsenal have been disastrous without Tierney. Nuno Tavares and Xhaka have both looked vulnerable in one-on-one situations, which were targeted specifically by Brighton in particular.¬† Graham Potter deployed Enock Mwepu in an unusual right-central midfield position that gave the Zambian licence to overlap down Arsenal's left, tripling up with Pascal Gross and Danny Welbeck. He scored one goal and assisted the other. As for the Southampton defeat, it could be argued Arsenal simply lacked the bite required to deal with such a hard-pressing central midfield¬† - a knock-on effect of the disjointedness that came from Partey's absence. But just as important was Arsenal's difficulty in scoring goals, an issue as much about technical ability as tactics. Throughout their recent winning streak, admittedly against lower-ranking opposition, Alexandre Lacazette's capacity to drop off the front line had looked like an upgrade on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but now his preference for playing with his back to goal is becoming a hindrance. Arsenal require somebody to make runs into the penalty area and poach; to make the movements needed for Saka, Odegaard and Smith Rowe to turn possession into chances. Currently, far too often Arsenal are working the ball out to Cedric Soares to swing aimless crosses into the box. Arteta's concern about his team's goalscoring is clear from his decision to move to a 3-5-2 or 4-4-2 formation for the final 30 minutes of each of their three consecutive defeats. But even playing two strikers, usually Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah together, has failed to produce high-quality chances in open play. The answer to Arsenal's problems is, quite simply, to sign better players over the summer. Being so badly affected by just one or two injuries points to a lack of squad depth, while replacing Aubameyang is clearly a top priority before the start of next season. As for the last seven games of the 2021-22 campaign, the key is getting back to making fast starts: Arsenal have taken the lead in 16 of the 17 league games they have won this season.¬† One way to do this would be moving Saka into the left-back position for the time being, adding creativity back to the left wing ‚Äì with Gabriel Martinelli or Nicolas Pepe replacing him on the right wing.¬† What is more, this move could help Arsenal build more fluidly out from the back in Partey's absence, as Saka can drift into central positions alongside Lokonga in the first phase of play, in turn freeing up Odegaard and Xhaka to become advanced eights once more. But aside from that, there is little Arteta can change between now and the summer. Arsenal fans will need to hope their up-and-down season has one more upswing left.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-season-fallen-apart-how-arteta-save-top-four-hopes/blt527a4743b2ea1290,Alex Keble,5dd7b234-9503-4dab-9899-a97ef50c2eeb
Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney 'likely' to miss rest of the season with knee injury & World Cup play-off concern for Scotland,"Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney is ""likely"" to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury, the Gunners have confirmed. The full-back picked up the problem in training last month and, after seeing a specialist, it has been decided it requires surgery. As well as missing the remainder of Arsenal's Premier League games, the 24-year-old could also now be a doubt for Scotland's World Cup play-off against Ukraine, which is currently scheduled for June. In a statement Arsenal said:¬†""Kieran felt discomfort after a training session on Thursday, March 31. Further assessments and scans have confirmed that Kieran has damaged his left knee. ""A specialist consultation took place on Tuesday, and as a result of further discussions with Kieran and our medical team, it has been decided that Kieran requires surgery to his knee. This procedure will take place in London in the forthcoming days. ""Kieran‚Äôs rehabilitation programme will start immediately after his surgery, at which stage a clearer understanding will be established on his recovery timescale. However, it is likely that Kieran will now miss the remainder of this season. ""Everyone at the club will now be supporting and working hard with Kieran to get him back on the pitch as soon as possible."" In addition, Arsenal said midfielder Thomas Partey is continuing to be assessed after picking up a thigh issue against the Eagles on Monday. This is a real blow to Arsenal‚Äôs hopes of securing a top-four spot this season. The biggest issue for Mikel Arteta is that Nuno Tavares, who is Tierney‚Äôs understudy, is suffering from a major crisis of confidence at present. He was withdrawn at half-time on Monday night after being given a torrid time by Crystal Palace and Arteta must now decide whether to give the young Portuguese left-back another opportunity.  If he opts against using Tavares, he would potentially have to use Granit Xhaka as a makeshift left-back. But with Thomas Partey also facing up to some time on the sidelines with a thigh problem, that would leave Arsenal very short in central midfield. Arteta has been fairly fortunate when it comes to injuries so far this season, but the loss of Tierney at such a crucial stage of the campaign is a hammer blow. And with right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu not expected back in full training until after the Southampton game on April 16, Arsenal‚Äôs options on either side of the back four are suddenly looking very limited. As well as a blow for Arsenal, it is also bad news for Scotland manager Steve Clarke ahead of that summer meeting with Ukraine. The play-off was originally scheduled for last month but was postponed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The game has been rescheduled for June, though that date could change again because of the ongoing conflict. When the game is eventually played the winner will play Wales for a place at Qatar 2022.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-defender-kieran-tierney-likely-to-miss-rest-of-the/bltab0087bd41e96c73,Tom Mallows,90b8056a-ae14-46f2-8d30-055c5fd2ffe1
Musa: Super Eagles to repay Nigerians with World Cup ticket against Ghana,"Nigeria captain Ahmed Musa has stated they are ready to compensate their fans by qualifying for the 2022 Fifa World Cup, at the expense of Ghana. The three-time African champions are looking to make up for their disappointing outing at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon where they were eliminated in the round of 16 by Tunisia. They battle Ghana at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on Friday in the first leg before travelling back to Abuja for the reverse fixture on March 29. Musa admitted the Super Eagles did not live up to expectations in Cameroon and he has revealed their mission for the games against the Black Stars. ""When we got knocked out of the Afcon it was not what we planned for but in football sometimes it is good and sometimes it is bad,"" Musa said in a press conference. ‚ÄúFor us and Ghana, it wasn‚Äôt a good tournament that is why the game would be tough for both teams. So we are back here in Abuja and ready for the game in two days time and hopefully, we will get the victory. ‚ÄúLike I said the Afcon was not good for all Nigerians which made us really sad but there is nothing we can do, that is football but we just have to pay the fans back with the World Cup ticket and the boys are ready to give their best.‚Äù Despite the venue change from Cape Coast to Kumasi, Musa remains upbeat about Nigeria's chances as he gets ready for his first game in the West African country. ""I have never played in Ghana but I have played a friendly game against them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have been hearing a lot of things that they have not lost in that stadium.

Chilwell says Chelsea 'won't get a better manager' than Tuchel & makes bizarre claim his ACL injury 'came at the perfect time',"Ben Chilwell considers Thomas Tuchel to form part of the global coaching elite and admits that Chelsea are ‚Äúnot going to get a better manager‚Äù than a German tactician that has already guided them to Champions League glory. The Blues moved to snap up a proven performer after parting with club legend Frank Lampard in January 2021, with a former Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain boss drafted into their dugout. A memorable European triumph was savoured within a matter of months, while success has also been enjoyed domestically when securing top-four finishes in the Premier League and reaching back-to-back FA Cup finals. Chilwell has no doubts that west London heavyweights have acquired the perfect candidate to lead them forward, as he said ahead of the start of their pre-season tour of America: ‚ÄúAs players we have full confidence in the manager. ‚ÄúWe know we‚Äôre not going to get a better manager here. I‚Äôm not just saying it. ‚ÄúNow there is that stability. Everything that could have potentially been tricky last season has been resolved so it is up to us to work and to try to get that consistency on the pitch.‚Äù A 25-year-old left-back is eager to play a leading role in Chelsea‚Äôs future, having recovered from a serious knee injury last season to make a return to action in a final day victory over Watford. Chilwell was first laid low at the end of November, before suffering a setback in training on Christmas Day, and missed six months of competition. He is now raring to go once more and is looking to take positives from an enforced spell on the sidelines, saying: ‚ÄúAs weird as it sounds, the injury happened at the perfect time, I'm back now and we are four or five months away from the World Cup. ‚ÄúIf I play well between now and then I'm confident I will be in the squad. It was never a worry I wasn't going to be in World Cup squad, you have to be positive. ‚ÄúI was fortunate. Four and a half months after surgery, I felt no pain. I never really had any bumps in the road. ‚ÄúIn terms of an injury like that, it was as plain-sailing as it could be. Every step I kept progressing, and I was fine. I was getting frustrated and I felt like I could have gone quicker, but that would have been stupid.‚Äù Chilwell, who has his England legacy number ‚Äò1235‚Äô tattooed on his leg, added on pushing for a place in Gareth Southgate‚Äôs plans for Qatar 2022: ‚ÄúIt would be the highlight not just of my career, but of my life. ‚ÄúOver the next three or four months I am just going to do everything that I can to try to make sure that is my spot.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chilwell-chelsea-better-manager-tuchel-acl-injury-perfect/bltbc989c610c209ad2,Chris Burton,1e245ec6-de27-4d97-9947-9ed51c79d2a1
'I don't have his number!' - Bale agent laughs off shock Getafe transfer link after huge claim from club president,"One of Gareth Bale‚Äôs representatives, Joshua Barnett, has laughed off talk of the Wales international remaining in Spain on the back of his departure from Real Madrid as a free agent, with the son of Jonathan Barnett ‚Äì the man who manages the 32-year-old‚Äôs career ‚Äì claiming to have had no contact with La Liga minnows Getafe. Bale has spent the last nine years of his career at Santiago Bernabeu, where he has won three Liga titles and five Champions League crowns while scoring more than 100 goals. His role in the squad was reduced in recent seasons however, and the club have confirmed that his contract will not be extended beyond June 30. Bale has been strongly linked with a return to the Premier League after previous spells at Tottenham and Southampton, but there have been suggestions that his agents are looking for other suitors in Spain. Getafe president Angel Torres has claimed that representatives of a man heading to the World Cup finals in Qatar later this year have been in touch to gauge whether they would be interested in bringing him to Coliseum Alfonso Perez. The Madrid-based club are considered among the lesser clubs in La Liga and certainly won't be rivalling the Blancos for top honours in the Spanish capital, but Torres sees Bale's arrival as a realistic ""possibility"". ""Someone may take it as a joke, but 45 or 50 minutes ago I spoke with his agents, and they offered him to us. It is not a joke,"" the Getafe president has told reporters.

Moyes on what Man Utd has lacked since Ferguson left the club,"David Moyes has reflected upon his time in charge of Manchester United, with the West Ham manager stating that while he hoped to have lasted longer in the role, he still thinks of it with ""great fondness"". The Irons boss succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, winning the FA Community Shield in his first game in charge, only to be gone before the end of his first season after failing to live up to expectations. Moyes is since reborn at London Stadium, having guided the club to the quarter-finals of the Europa League in his second spell in charge - but in a lengthy chat with former England striker Alan Shearer, has now opened up upon his memories of leading the Red Devils. ""At Manchester United, I think maybe I needed a chance to grow into it,"" Moyes told The Athletic. ""You talk about players coming into the Premier League and needing a bit of time. It wasn‚Äôt that I needed time in the Premier League, but I needed time at the club to find myself and to find how I was going. ""The truth is, I wanted just to carry on what Sir Alex had done. I couldn‚Äôt be Sir Alex, but I wanted to continue the model they had, developing young players, putting young players in the team, trying to play in a fashion that suited them. That was the idea. ""I only look back at it with great fondness, honoured that I was offered a job of that magnitude. Unfortunately, I only got ten months. I think if I‚Äôd been given a bit longer, I could have done better, but ultimately I can only blame myself because I needed to win more games."" Though Moyes holds the shortest post-Ferguson tenure at United, his three full-time successors - Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - have all also struggled to follow in the Scotsman's footsteps when it comes to Premier League success. ‚ÄúI keep hearing about Man United needing a top coach to make the difference,‚Äù Moyes added. ‚ÄúMan United have had a lot of top managers - [I'm] not putting myself in that category at all, but they‚Äôve had some great managers. ""The difficulty for them now is to really find the same rhythm they found under Sir Alex, which when you look back now was incredible for their football club, it really was. You look back at a lot of the dynasties at football clubs ‚Äî Brian Clough [at Nottingham Forest], Sir Bobby Robson at Ipswich, even Don Revie [at Leeds United]. ""Howard Wilkinson told me, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôd spoken to me earlier, David, I would have told you anyone who goes to take these jobs tends to find it‚Äôs really difficult to make it work‚Äô. It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt know that, but [‚Ä¶] because of the way Sir Alex approached me to take the job [‚Ä¶], it made it more personal, it made me feel like, well, yes, there‚Äôs a model here that they felt I could continue, that I would be the right person. And it wasn‚Äôt to be.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/moyes-on-what-man-utd-has-lacked-since-ferguson-left-the/bltf3e286bd4d8d4261,Andrew Steel,dde8c90a-628e-472a-bb05-08a2fe57358e
The best Americans to play in the Premier League: From Dempsey to Pulisic,"The Premier League is viewed by many people in the United States as the pinnacle of the club game. It's the division where the spotlight is brightest, the one where stars are made and broadcast onto TVs all over the world. It's where kids honing their crafts on stateside pitches aspire to play. A total of 49 Americans have competed in England's top flight, with the league hosting many of American soccer's best ever exports.

Kostic to join Juventus in ‚Ç¨17m transfer as midfielder leaves Frankfurt ahead of UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid,"Juventus have signed Filip Kostic for around ‚Ç¨17 million ($17m/¬£14m), with the deal confirmed by Eintracht Frankfurt manager Oliver Glasner on Tuesday. Kostic, capable of playing anywhere on the left side, leaves Frankfurt as one of the club's most revered players in recent memory. He delivered an assist in the Europa League final victory over Rangers in May and was involved in 21 goals across all competitions last term. As a result of his contributions, Glasner holds no grudge against the Serbia international for moving to Juventus, with the head coach calling him a ""hero"" in comments made ahead of the UEFA Super Cup with Real Madrid. ""From a sporting point of view, the fact that we are losing such a player is clearly a weakening,"" the manager told reporters. ""But I also [feel OK] because I know how the season started last year with Filip's strike, where he didn't play.  ""We had a lot of talks then and he put himself 100 per cent at the service of the team. That's when I said that he should leave the team as a hero for once. That's what he's doing now, he's leaving Eintracht as a European Cup winner. As a hero who helped shape it. ""He was player of the season in the Europa League, which he deserves. I don't begrudge him that from the bottom of my heart. From a sporting point of view, it's a shame."" Glasner continued: ""We have had the Filip issue every year since he joined us. Of course it's a shame, Filip has done a lot for this club. He leaves as a hero who played a big part in this team - but you have to be honest: That's part of football. ""Players come and go. Today is the day an important player left. That is part of the game. We have a team that is capable of winning games and performing well without Filip. It's a pity, but it's nothing that will throw us off track."" An announcement is expected this week, as Kostic is already set to land in Turin on Tuesday to complete a medical. The 29-year-old could make his Juventus debut on Monday against Sassuolo or on August 22 against Sampdoria.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kostic-juventus-transfer-frankfurt-uefa-super-cup-real/blta2db7f7ea56ca0a9,Dan Bernstein,02c5a4e0-571c-4885-b09c-d29024589c8a
Pogba: Man Utd's preening social media superstar off the field - but a flop on it,"Paul Pogba‚Äôs departure should come as a welcome relief for Manchester United. As part of this latest reboot, it feels important to cut ties with the France international ‚Äì who is set to re-join Juventus on a free transfer ‚Äì no matter his undoubted talents. Erik ten Hag needs to get everything right in his first summer at Old Trafford. He cannot afford to expend the emotional energy on being the latest manager to try to cajole Pogba into the player United always hoped he would be. In that sense, Ten Hag can consider himself fortunate that the 29-year-old decided the time was right to go. Glazer-nomics don‚Äôt usually allow for assets to walk away for nothing ‚Äì see the bemusing contracts handed out to Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Eric Bailly and so many more. But Pogba wants out ‚Äì and that will finally let United move on from one of the most disappointing signings in their history. Pogba will probably feel he was let down by a club that promised him the world, but careered from one crisis to another. Yet his part in this sorry episode cannot be ignored. In six infuriating years at Old Trafford, he came to symbolise much of what is wrong with United. A preening social media superstar off the pitch. A complete let-down on it. He was inconsistent, distracting and destabilising. He was also as much an icon to many team-mates as he was to his millions of fans on Instagram and Twitter. That presents its own problems. Pogba was the kid who walked away for nothing and came back as the most expensive player on the planet. He was a winner with Juventus and a world champion with France. His social media following is bigger than many pop stars and he models for Gucci. There is a lot for young players to look up to ‚Äì which is what is so dangerous. Because, in terms of what he produced for United, there was little substance. What message does that send? It feeds a sense that great rewards can be achieved without actually delivering. Pogba‚Äôs only trophies were in his first season at the club ‚Äì the Carabao Cup and Europa League. As for stand out performances? His two goals in the comeback win to delay Manchester City‚Äôs title celebrations in 2018 provided United fans with a day that will live long in the memory ‚Äì but it was also a performance that showcased precisely what they had been missing. On the eve of that match, Pep Guardiola dropped the bombshell that Pogba‚Äôs former agent, Mino Raiola, had been trying to secure his client a move across Manchester. That was less than two years since his return to United ‚Äì and was a continuing theme. All the details behind Paul Pogba's expected Juventus return ‚ö´Ô∏è‚ö™Ô∏è‚úçÔ∏è @romeoagresti Raiola‚Äôs public statements and Pogba‚Äôs own hints about his desire to leave were a frequent distraction ‚Äì and just a bad look for a club that considers itself the biggest in the world. In hindsight, United would have been wise to cut their losses in the summer of 2019 when the midfielder announced ‚Äúit could be time to have a new challenge.‚Äù By November of that year, they had accepted he would not sign a new deal and priced him at ¬£150 million ($190m). If not for the global pandemic, they might have secured a profit on the ¬£89m ($110m) they paid Juve in 2016, but even without it, their valuation was always unrealistic, given his inconsistent form. Instead, it has been a tedious, drawn-out departure. It feels fitting that he goes in the same year as Ed Woodward finally called time on his attempts to return United to their former glories. Pogba was the former executive vice-chairman‚Äôs finest moment. After missing out on Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Neymar ‚Äì Pogba was the truly marquee signing he was desperate to deliver after taking up his post. He began work on it from the moment he succeeded former chief executive, David Gill, at the top of the club. Pogba and Raiola had infuriated Sir Alex Ferguson by walking away for nothing in 2012 when considered the brightest emerging talent at the club. Woodward fostered a relationship with Raiola from 2013, despite Ferguson‚Äôs disdain for the agent. Meeting after meeting was held to iron out the finer details of one of the most complex contracts United had ever drawn up, with image rights one of the main sticking points. Competition from Real Madrid was another major factor ‚Äì but the Glazers were determined to make a statement by beating the Spanish giants to one of the great players in the world. Wind the clock forward and it is debatable if Pogba leaves as one of the great players in the Premier League. A move to Manchester City ‚Äì who were exploring the possibility of luring him to the Etihad this summer ‚Äì would have been fascinating. But there would be a serious doubt over whether he could hold down a place in Guardiola‚Äôs team. Since his return to United, he has only made the PFA Team of the Year on one occasion. In only one season did he break double figures for goals. Could Ten Hag have succeeded where Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer failed? Possibly. But is Pogba even worth the risk at such a delicate period in United‚Äôs history? This is a latest cultural reset, after all, and Pogba was a symbol of a culture of excess and failure at United. For all that, it is impossible to imagine United wouldn‚Äôt have accommodated him if he‚Äôd shown the slightest inclination to stay. Perhaps his greatest gift was to take the decision out of their hands.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/paul-pogba-man-utd-preening-social-media-superstar-complete/blt21d108c559494242,James Robson,178857ce-f64a-47fb-95bc-f9be1cac68e6
"'If you're going to be overtaken, let it be by someone better than you' - Alves pays Messi tribute as PSG star closes on former Barcelona team-mate's trophy record","Dani Alves is not worried about the prospect of Lionel Messi matching his trophy haul after the Paris Saint-Germain star's latest success. Messi helped the French giants to the Ligue 1 title this week as they played out a 1-1 draw with Lens to put them out of reach of second-placed Marseille. The victory means Messi now has 39 trophies to his name, while his ex-Barcelona team-mate is not far ahead despite being the most decorated player in the game, having collected 43 honours over the course of his career. The Brazilian full-back posted an image on Instagram showing the two stars' trophy collections side by side.

Messi scored the decisive goal against Lens that secured the Ligue 1 title for Mauricio Pochettino's team. It is his fourth goal in Ligue 1 this season after 22 appearances in the French top flight.

Liverpool vs Leeds and Wolves vs Watford postponed as Covid-19 threatens Boxing Day schedule,"Liverpool's clash with Leeds and Wolves' meeting with Watford have been postponed due to Covid-19, which is threatening the entire Boxing Day schedule. The coronavirus variant Omicron has already caused disruption to the Premier League calendar, with a number of clubs forced into closing their training grounds to contain the spread of the ilness. Only four fixtures ended up going ahead last weekend, and Boxing Day will also now have a reduced order of play after Leeds and Watford reported outbreaks in their squads. A Premier League statement reads: ""Following postponement requests from Leeds United and Watford as a result of Covid-19, the Premier League board met this morning and regrettably agreed to call off the two affected clubs‚Äô Boxing Day fixtures. üì∞ #LUFC are disappointed to confirm that our Boxing Day fixture with Liverpool has been postponed following new COVID cases ""The two matches are Wolverhampton Wanderers v Watford and Liverpool v Leeds United, both due to be played on Sunday at 12:30 GMT.

The Whites have been forced to close their training ground and may not be able to fulfil their next fixture against Aston Villa. There is some light at the end of the tunnel for Watford though, who also saw their game against Crystal Palace last Saturday called off.

Rangnick accepts Manchester United rely on Ronaldo but remains unsure if he wants to stay and play for Ten Hag,"Manchester United have been reliant on Cristiano Ronaldo this season, admits interim manager Ralf Rangnick, however, he is still not sure if the veteran forward will be with the club next season. Ronaldo rode to United's rescue again on Thursday, scoring the equaliser in their 1-1 draw with Chelsea to keep alive their Premier League top-four hopes. There is uncertainty around Ronaldo amid the imminent change in the dugout at Old Trafford, and Rangnick cannot give firm assurances at this stage about the club's talisman. Asked by reporters after the match if United had become reliant on the 37-year-old, Rangnick indicated they did as he said: ""We go through the list of names that are missing since the West Ham game. You realise, that we have all the offensive players on the pitch, the only one on the bench was Juan Mata."" Ronaldo is the only United player to hit double figures for goals this season, his 23 in all competitions more than double that of any other man in the squad. Bruno Fernandes is second with nine. Rangnick, however, moved to defend his team, and said: ""We have to be still fair with the players. We had quite a few other players scoring goals, I remember my first 10 games and we had 10 different goalscorers. It is how many opportunities can we create and how many goalscorers we have available. ""If you compare our players with the ones Chelsea had, the bench with the one Chelsea had. This is not an excuse but it is an explanation. ""Yes, right now, we very much rely on Cristiano, he also showed a good performance when Chelsea were in possession. There has to be a focus on bringing in a couple of new strikers for sure."" Rangnick is moving away from the manager's seat next season, switching to a consultancy role - which it appears he will now do alongside coaching the Austria men's national team. He is being replaced as United manager by Erik ten Hag, leaving Ronaldo's status at the club more uncertain, and Rangnick refused to speculate on what the new man in charge will decide. Rangnick said: ""This is something that we should speak between Erik and the board and myself. Cristiano has another year of contract, it is also important to find out what he wants, if he wants to stay. ""Again, I haven't spoken to Erik so far so it doesn't make sense to speak about it right now."" While uncertainty blows around him, Ronaldo on the pitch was United's hero again as his equaliser earned them an important point against Chelsea on Thursday as they chase Champions League qualification. Ronaldo wrote on Instagram afterwards: ""Thanks for the support in Old Trafford tonight. As always, our fans were amazing in their effort to help the team.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rangnick-man-utd-ronaldo-stay-ten-hag/blt8c291346b5082693,Emma Smith,526ee559-1e93-4070-b0e7-464d195b95b1

From unsuccessful trials to scoring against Barcelona aged 32: The ‚Äòinsane‚Äô story of Jordan Clark,"Usually, when you glance up at the jumbotron during a game at the Johan Cruyff Stadium, home of Barcelona‚Äôs all-conquering women‚Äôs team, the list of goalscorers almost exclusively features the names of the European champions' biggest stars. Ballon d‚ÄôOr Feminin winner Alexia Putellas has netted 14 times at the venue this season. UEFA and FIFA‚Äôs 2017 Player of Year Lieke Martens has hit 10 goals. Jenni Hermoso, the all-time leading goalscorer for Barca and Spain, has six. In October, though, for 11 minutes, there was just a single name on the board ‚Äì and it was on the away team‚Äôs side. It remains the only time a team has taken the lead against Barcelona this season and it was the first goal they‚Äôd conceded in the 2021-22 campaign. The name up there? That of Jordan Clark, a 32-year-old playing her third match as a professional footballer. In the end, Barca would emerge victorious against Deportivo Alaves, winning 9-1. When the full-time whistle went, Clark looked up at the electronic scoreboard. She was outnumbered by that stage, but she was still there. ‚ÄúI saw my name and took it in that I'm in their stadium, on that field and had that kind of moment‚Ä¶ All of that just kind of hits you in a wave,‚Äù Clark tells GOAL. ‚ÄúEverything I've fought for and had blood, sweat and tears for on the way over here, for it to lead to something like that, scoring against the best team in the world, and being the first in the season to do so, is just insane.‚Äù 17'‚è± | 0-1‚öΩÔ∏è ¬°¬°Gol gol gol de Clark!!#Bar√ßaAlav√©s #GoazenGloriosas ü¶ä pic.twitter.com/sbcFlRGngz Two months before that goal, she had landed in Vienna on her 32nd birthday to chase her dream of being a professional footballer. Achieving that ambition has been difficult. When Clark graduated from college in the United States, the country's top league had folded, so there wasn‚Äôt a college draft to enter. An opportunity in Germany didn‚Äôt turn out to be the springboard she‚Äôd have hoped. Clark returned home and went to as many trials as she could afford for several years, but it‚Äôs a demanding process, particularly while she was trying to keep her and her fianc√© financially stable as he worked his way towards being a pilot. In April last year, she was settled into a full-time job and had bought a house with her partner. Then, in August, an opportunity to go to Europe and chase that dream presented itself again. Clark threw herself into it. ‚ÄúThis is just something that's been burning out of me since I can remember,‚Äù she says, noting the ‚Äúmassive impact‚Äù the United States‚Äô iconic 1999 World Cup-winning side had on her desire to become a professional player. ‚ÄúI grew up following Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm, and that definitely sparked a ton of inspiration. That was absolutely where I think I got my drive from. ‚ÄúI don't even know if I knew that there was really a pro league. I was just like, 'I want to do what they're doing. That's super cool.'"" She left a family holiday to fly to Austria and, after impressing in a trial that included a game against Bayern Munich, the feedback was pointing towards a contract. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, in the end, it came down to it being complicated with a foreign transfer from the U.S. and some budget issues,‚Äù Clark says. ‚ÄúTo me, it was looking like, 'Yes, yes, yes!' I thought for sure it was going to be a go. Then, at the last second, it was like, 'Oh, no!'"" Clark was stuck in Vienna. Sola Abolaji, a former pro himself, was putting feelers out for another trial while she stayed with his friend, but things weren‚Äôt looking good. Last week we got you the fantastic story of Clark who with help from CMG @emasar3 gets to live her dream , playing in the Spanish league. Now the girl just scored a goal! Against Barcelona! This is a true fairytale. pic.twitter.com/FOgZveQRyR ‚ÄúI was on the phone with Sola and he was like: 'I have called everyone. The transfer window is narrowing, our timeline is closing. I've tried, there's just nothing out there right now. I think it's going to have to be time to go home',‚Äù Clark remembers. ‚ÄúHe said those words, and I kid you not, he's like, 'Hang on, I'm getting a call right now. I have to take this.'"" On the other end of the phone was Ella Masar, a former U.S. international who played for Paris Saint-Germain, the Chicago Red Stars and the Houston Dash, among others, before moving into player representation. She knew of an opportunity with Madrid CFF, the team that finished seventh in Spain‚Äôs top flight last season. They wanted a defensive midfielder, Clark‚Äôs position. She flew straight to Spain but, to her surprise, found herself playing at full-back in a trial match against Real Madrid. Despite it going well, the club realised they needed to fill that position instead. ‚ÄúI didn't actually have anything in the wind for after that,‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey even asked me, 'What are you going to do now?' I'm like, 'I don't know. I have no idea.'"" Masar kept ""working her magic"" though and Clark was on her way to Alaves within two days. It was there she would finally get her break ‚Äì a reward for never giving up, thousands of miles from home. It‚Äôs been going very well, too. The newly-promoted team are tenth in the league, well clear of any sort of danger, and were at one point just six points off a Champions League spot. There‚Äôs clear ambition within the club when it comes to the women's team and performances are encouraging. In a way, it makes sense that Clark ended up with this team, their underdog statuses aligned perfectly via a crazy path. They both possess ambition beyond what people may expect, too. ‚ÄúI would love to battle for a Champions League place if we can make that happen,‚Äù Clark says. ‚ÄúI've never known if I was going to get this opportunity, but I want to see where I'm capable of going in the time that I have left. ""I'm not even sure of the potential but I would like to make it as high as I can. Playing in a Champions League game, at some point in my career, would be just phenomenal. ‚ÄúI've known that this is always what I wanted. As much as you still question after hearing no, after no, after no, I felt deep down like it was something I could do. That I had the capability, if I was just given a real shot.‚Äù She‚Äôs certainly making the most of that shot now.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/unsuccessful-trials-scoring-against-barcelona-aged-32-insane/blte8999f59ee4d4412,Ame√© Ruszkai,20b641e2-ce26-445c-8345-e596656093a6

"Nobody likes Rudiger situation, admits Tuchel as Chelsea boss demands more from James and Loftus-Cheek","Thomas Tuchel believes nobody likes Antonio Rudiger's choice to leave Chelsea this summer, but says he and the rest of his squad will respect the Germany international's decision to leave. The centre-back's contract expires at the close of the campaign and, amid complications presented over the club's impending change of ownership, he has announced he will depart. The news is something of a blow to the Blues, who could see several key faces leave during the offseason - and now the manager has commented on what the call has left him feeling. ""I don't think anybody likes it,"" Tuchel stated ahead of his side's clash with Manchester United. ""Toni has [been] a huge factor in our last one-and-a-half seasons together. He gives everybody confidence in the dressing room, he is a unique character. ""He's an aggressive leader, he plays on an outstanding level, and he gives you confidence if you play next to him, if you play around him. Sometimes, he takes the focus away from others, onto him; he takes responsibility, he loves responsibility. ""So I don't think anybody likes this decision. But at the moment, we have to accept it and we will accept it. Like it or not, there will be life at Chelsea after Toni, and now the most important thing is that it ends like it started, on the highest level possible."" Elsewhere, Tuchel highlighted what England duo Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Reece James need to do in order to prove themselves further. ""[Loftus-Cheek] needs to push himself to the limit,"" the German said. ""In general he is a shy and calm person but he needs to discover the monster in him and unleash this on a regular basis. It is necessary.  ""I would love to have two of Reece James. It is 50 per cent at wing-back and 50 per cent in the back three. I'm a bit more leaning that his very best position is the wing-back position but it is more demanding.

"'When you say Abraham is fantastic, I disagree' - Mourinho demands even more from Roma's derby hero","Jose Mourinho has demanded even more from Roma's derby hero Tammy Abraham, insisting he has not yet earned the right to be called a ""fantastic"" player. Abraham scored twice in Roma's 3-0 victory over Lazio at Stadio Olimpico on Sunday, which ensured that Mourinho's side leapfrogged their arch-rivals in the Serie A standings. The Portuguese was pleased with the striker's latest display, but has now challenged him to carry the same ""attitude"" into games on a more consistent basis. ""When you say Abraham is fantastic I disagree, he can do even more,"" Mourinho told DAZN when quizzed on Abraham's man-of-the-match showing. ""I demand a lot of him because I know his potential, I‚Äôm not talking about goals, but he must play every game with this attitude."" The Roma boss added on his pride after seeing the team execute his gameplan perfectly: ""Great performance. Today was really special because it seemed that everything we had planned was put on the field, Lazio in the second half tried to play with pride but we never lost control.  ""No doubt, the boys deserved the victory."" More than a few eyebrows were raised when Roma paid ¬£34 million ($45m) to sign Abraham from Chelsea last summer as the England international departed Stamford Bridge after falling down the squad pecking order under Thomas Tuchel. Mourinho placed his trust in Abraham right from the beginning, though, and he has rewarded his manager by hitting 23 goals in 40 appearances across all competitions in 2021-22. The 24-year-old set a new record for the most goals in a debut season for Roma after his brace against Lazio, which had previously been shared by club legends Gabriel Batistuta and Vincenzo Montella, both of whom managed 21. Reece James, a former Chelsea team-mate of Abraham's, took to social media to express his support for the Roma striker following his brace against Lazio On his Instagram story, James posted a photo of Tammy Abraham with the caption, ‚ÄúNumbers don‚Äôt lie. Pay some respect please‚Äù, in reference to the amount of goals the England international has scored since joining Mourinho‚Äôs side.  The two played alongside each other for two seasons at Chelsea before Abraham departed for Roma in 2021.

Emery was tempted by Newcastle manager's job and reveals how it would have been different to the 'hard work' at Arsenal,"Unai Emery has admitted he was tempted by the opportunity to become Newcastle United manager before deciding to stay as Villarreal coach. The Spaniard was initially the favourite to become the new Magpies boss after Steve Bruce was sacked following the Saudi takeover at St James' Park. However, the former Arsenal boss changed his mind and also revealed how the task at Newcastle would have been different to the one he faced when he was at the Emirates Stadium.  ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Newcastle project is an attractive project - something to build, different to Arsenal,'‚Äô Emery told The Athletic. ‚Äò‚ÄôWith Arsenal, you first had to knock down the walls, which is hard work, then start to build again. Newcastle, no; it was just about building from the ground up. So it is different, and I liked the idea. But I was also grateful to Villarreal for the opportunity they gave me, and we were in the Champions League. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Premier League is an attractive league for all us coaches. So when Newcastle called me, I thought a lot about the opportunity to return to England, to a serious project. For me, it was a source of pride, satisfaction ‚Äî and I appreciated it. The opportunity of a club like Newcastle, what it could turn out to be, it is normal to listen to the offer, to consider it. ‚Äò‚ÄôI thought about the offer and I spoke with (Villarreal president) Fernando Roig. But I also had to take into account that we were in the Champions League with Villarreal, mid-season. In the end, with a lot of respect for Villarreal, and a lot of respect for Newcastle, I decided to stay here. I am happy and we are doing an important job.‚Äô‚Äô Following Arsene Wenger's retirement, Emery became the Gunners' manager in May 2018 after leaving Paris Saint-Germain. Emery led Arsenal on an 11-game winning streak, their best run of form since 2007, and also on an unbeaten span of 22 matches, as well as reaching the 2019 Europa League final, which they lost to Chelsea 4-1. However, following a summer transfer window which saw the likes of Nicolas Pepe, David Luiz and Kieran Tierney arrive in north London, Emery was sacked towards the end of 2019 following a winless run of seven games. He went back to Spain, leading Villarreal to the first European final, where they beat Manchester United on penalties to lift the Europa League in 2021. Newcastle settled on appointing former Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe in November following Emery's decision to stay in La Liga. Howe has performed a fine job at St James' Park, with a record of eight wins, five draws and eight defeats, to lead Newcastle nine points clear of the relegation zone.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/emery-tempted-newcastle-manager-job-different-hard-work/blt533075963c7f7115,Michel Jreissati,ba4b3e8b-bf2f-43f8-ace8-21dd8e023d06
Are Barcelona back? Traore shines as Xavi era ignited by Atletico Madrid win,"Match statistics: Barcelona 4-2 Atletico Madrid It takes months for a team to be moulded into shape by a coach, for a fallen giant to be resurrected. But a rebirth has to start somewhere, and Barcelona‚Äôs thrilling 4-2 victory over Atletico Madrid on Sunday felt like a new beginning. From turning around an initial deficit, to racking up a a three-goal lead and then holding on with 10 men for the final quarter of the game following Dani Alves' red card, it was a character-building afternoon at a fiery, revitalised Camp Nou. The victory pulls Barca into the top four for the first time in months, leapfrogging opponents Atletico by two points. It was a fresh start for Adama Traore too, with the loan signing from Wolves unleashed on Atletico to great effect. His presence on the pitch seemed to energise Barcelona to a remarkable extent, with this performance unrecognisable from the drab display at Alaves in their previous encounter before the international break. It took a perfect storm of events for the former La Masia star to be given a path back to the club, but however unlikely the reunion, Traore was determined to take his chance with both hands. In the opening minutes he whistled past Mario Hermoso and was fouled by the left-back, the start of a long afternoon for the Spaniard. Almost 75,000 fans - one of the biggest attendances of the season - roared. Yet out nowhere, Atletico took the lead. Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba were caught out and Yannick Carrasco slotted past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. It looked like Barca were falling victim to the same poor defending they have been plagued with all season, which got them into this mess in the first place. That will need to be changed, but in the January transfer window they could not make defensive signings and instead brought in three attackers, in the shape of Traore, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ferran Torres, plus right-back Alves, although his comfort zone is in opposition territory, as evidenced by his goal and assist here, as well as his defensive deficiencies that eventually led to his dismissal. The attack was the area Xavi and sporting director Mateu Alemany hit in January, and it was the area clearly improved in this match as the Catalans earned a statement victory. Players who have been criticised in recent weeks stood up and performed; Alba lashing Barcelona level with a spectacular volley from Alves‚Äô cross, while Frenkie de Jong put in his best performance of the Xavi era.

The Wolves winger set up the second goal with a surge down the right and cross for Gavi to head home. Stretching the pitch by staying wider than Ousmane Dembele might, Traore is already contributing. Barca take the lead thanks in part to brilliant work from Adama Traore to provide the assist for Gavi! üî•What a game this is! üôå pic.twitter.com/7IIQVxGLwr Adama Traore setting up Gavi for the finish to lead over Atleti! üî• pic.twitter.com/ge7UOkOF1Z His¬†direct attacking brought back the thrills Barcelona fans have been denied since Lionel Messi‚Äôs departure, and the performance as a whole was reminiscent of the Blaugrana's 3-1 win over Atletico in January 2015. Then, a heavily-doubted team clicked into gear, with Neymar, Luis Suarez and Messi all scoring, sparking a Barca revival that saw the team surge to the treble. This win cannot do the same, but it could be the start of something significant. Dembele, for his part, remained on the bench throughout, his name jeered when read out among the substitutes pre-game, and Xavi decided to keep him in reserve. He had enough firepower on the pitch, and the third goal arrived shortly before half-time when Ronald Araujo rammed home, with the Atletico defence in shambles. Alves added the fourth after the break after good work by Gavi, and it seemed Barca were set to go on a rampage, but the team tired in the second half - something else for Xavi to keep working on. Former Barcelona hitman Suarez headed home and then Alves earned a foolish red in the 69th minute for an ugly lunge on the electric Carrasco. Even though it stunted Xavi's team, it also allowed them to show their mettle, with De Jong in particular throwing himself into tackles to help protect the lead. Aubameyang was left without much chance to contribute on his debut as a substitute, but blocked a couple of Atletico long balls forward to help stave off the visitors‚Äôs onslaught. Barcelona held on for a victory which could be seen as a six-pointer in the battle to secure a Champions League spot. It will be worth a lot more than that, though, if it truly is the start of the rebirth the fans badly crave.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/are-barcelona-back-traore-shines-xavi-atletico-madrid-win/bltb33d52bc935e7cf7,Rik Sharma,5a977abe-23ed-4add-8657-c97214244831
'Saliba has Marseille in his heart' - Guendouzi vows to persuade defender to leave Arsenal,"Matteo Guendouzi says he will try to convince William Saliba to leave Arsenal and join Marseille on a permanent basis. Saliba made a loan switch from the Gunners to France last August and played a starring role for the Ligue 1 side, while Guendouzi also found success away from the Emirates Stadium. The 21-year-old centre-back made 52 appearances as Marseille finished second in the French top-flight and reached the Europa Conference League semi-finals. Guendouzi, who also joined Marseille on loan from Arsenal last year and looks set to sign a permanent deal, has vowed to persuade his fellow France international to stay at the Stade Velodrome. He told Telefoot: ""William has OM now in his heart, and I'm sure he will return to Marseille next season.  ""So I will try to push him again to stay with us."" Earlier this week, however, Saliba insisted he would return to Arsenal and fight for his place in Mikel Arteta's team next season. ""I belong to Arsenal, and I still have two years there. I will be there for pre-season with Arsenal,"" the centre-back said. ""I have played zero matches with Arsenal and I want to show them what I‚Äôm made of and have the chance to play for the supporters and for this big club. ""That depends only on me.

‚ÄòLate bloomer‚Äô Van Dijk targets trophies he missed out on as a kid as Liverpool remain in quadruple hunt,"Virgil van Dijk is determined to make the most of every shot at silverware he gets with Liverpool, as the Reds chase down a potential quadruple in 2021-22, with the Dutch defender admitting that he did not collect an impressive haul of medals as a child due to being a ‚Äúlate bloomer‚Äù. A meteoric rise to prominence has carried the Netherlands international to the very top of a world game, with a standing among the global elite now enjoyed by a man that finished as runner-up to Lionel Messi in the 2019 Ballon d‚ÄôOr. The 30-year-old centre-half has become a Champions League and Premier League title winner on the back of a record-setting ¬£75 million ($98m) transfer to Anfield in 2018, while also claiming Carabao Cup honours this season, and is determined to make up for lost time on the trophy front. Quizzed on whether he has been in a similar situation before as to the one that Liverpool find themselves in at present, with a clean sweep still on the cards, Van Dijk said: ‚ÄúNo, no. Definitely not. I was not a great player either back in the day. I was quite a late bloomer, that‚Äôs why I enjoy my career even more. ‚ÄúEvery day I take it as it is. Enjoy it. For me coming back from the injury as well, having seen everything from the sideline last year, to be in all competitions still is something I won‚Äôt take for granted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve played almost over 50 games this season so that is something I won‚Äôt take for granted. I just want to keep it going, stay fit, win games and see what it brings and get ready for the World Cup as well.‚Äù Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side moved a step closer to FA Cup glory in their latest outing, as they edged out Manchester City 3-2 in the semi-finals of that competition, and are also into the last four of the Champions League while sitting one point off the pace in a thrilling Premier League title race. Pressed on whether an opportunity to become legends on Merseyside, and in the wider football world, is serving as added motivation to Liverpool, Van Dijk said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that everyone would dream about, to win every competition you participate in but we will see what it brings. ‚ÄúCity are still in the pole position in the league, that‚Äôs how it is. We are facing Villarreal in the Champions League who are going to be very difficult, obviously the final of this so we will see. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also not something that we take for granted that everyone is fit. Anything can happen, with other teams as well. We just take it day by day and game by game.‚Äù The Reds are fortunate to have a fully fit squad at their disposal right now, with fierce competition for places being added to by the emergence of recent arrivals such as Ibrahima Konate and Luis Diaz. Van Dijk has been impressed by both, with centre-half partner Konate coming in for special praise on the back of a run that has seen him head home from corners in each of his last three appearances. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs looking quite impressive for his age as well,‚Äù Van Dijk said of the 22-year-old Frenchman. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very mature but there is still so much to learn for him. Everyone can still improve. He has such a good mentality, he wants to learn, he wants to improve and we are just happy that the players that have come in have adapted so well. ‚ÄúLuis, unbelievable first half as well [against City] with the impact he had.

Barcelona agree ‚Ç¨55m deal to sign Manchester City winger Ferran Torres,"Barcelona have agreed a ‚Ç¨55 million (¬£47m/$62m) deal to sign Manchester City winger Ferran Torres, GOAL can confirm. The Spain international, who hasn't played for City since September due to a foot injury, is set to join Xavi's side in January despite the Catalans' financial troubles. Barca will now have to focus on offloading players from their first-team squad as they look to meet La Liga's financial fair play rules. GOAL can confirm Barca have reached an agreement with City to sign Torres, with both clubs set to officially announce the news in the coming days. Barca's director of football Mateu Alemany undertook the negotiations with the Spain international, who is keen to return to his homeland after leaving Valencia in August 2020. The Liga club will pay an initial fee of ‚Ç¨55m for Torres, with an additional amount of around ‚Ç¨7m to follow in add-ons. GOAL understands City had requested a figure approaching ‚Ç¨70m for the player, but have ultimately settled on a slightly smaller fee. Valencia will receive 10% of the transfer, having added that stipulation to their agreement with City last year, plus an additional 4%. Barcelona's financial woes have been well documented, and players will now have to leave as a matter of urgency to ensure Torres can be registered in La Liga. Sergio Aguero's decision to retire due to a heart condition frees up his salary, with others needing to be offloaded, either on loan or, more preferably, in permanent transfers.  Barca would listen to offers for many of their first-team squad, aside from a few untouchables including Pedri, Gavi and Ansu Fati, with big-earners including Samuel Umtiti and Philippe Coutinho in the shop window.  Ferran Torres represented great value when he joined Manchester City in the summer of 2020 but he has struggled to force his way into Pep Guardiola's plans.  Competing for a place as a winger with players such as Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva is not easy, although he has made his biggest impact as a central striker.  While he has also excelled for Spain's national team, realistically City are still in the hunt for a more orthodox striker and reliable scorer, which they haven't had since Aguero left the club.  A sizeable return on Torres is too good to turn down and can help finance a big-money move elsewhere, with Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland a top target.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-50m-deal-man-city-winger-ferran-torres/bltf590fd3ad3646f26,Ruben Uria,e26a5764-71cb-4800-a969-b41be6d4c8f0
"Who is new Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag? Teams coached, trophies won, tactics & philosophy explained","Manchester United have appointed Erik ten Hag as their new manager, and he will take charge at Old Trafford following the conclusion of this season. The Dutch tactician will leave his current position as Ajax boss and become United‚Äôs fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club in 2013. He will replace Ralf Rangnick, who has been interim manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November. In 2012, Ten Hag was given the charge of Go Ahead Eagles, a club in the Eerste Divisie (Second Division in Netherlands). He stayed there for one season and guided the club to its first promotion in 17 years.  In his next assignment, he moved on to Bayern Munich Reserves in June 2013. During this stint, he worked closely with Pep Guardiola, who was then working as the first team manager in Munich.  After spending two years in Germany he returned to Netherlands and took on the role of sporting director and head coach at FC Utrecht. In 2017, he moved to Ajax and guided them to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals in 2018-19. His troops beat defending champions Real Madrid at the Round of 16 stage and ousted Juventus in the quarter-finals before falling to Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham in the last four. In fact, Pochettino had also been one of the contenders for the United job.

His first managerial silverware was the KNVB Cup, which he won after beating Willem II in the final. He  also won the league and completed the domestic double.  Ten Hag also has the distinction of being the fastest coach to 100 wins in the Eredivisie, as he achieved the milestone in just 128 matches.  Trophy Year(s) won Eredivisie 2018-19, 2020-21 KNVB Cup 2018-19, 2020-21 Johan Cruyff Shield 2019 Erik ten Hag likes his team to keep the ball. He is attack-minded and looks to be in charge of the game with lots of possession. He has openly admired Guardiola and admitted that his philosohpies have had an effect on his coaching philosophy.  ‚ÄúI learned a lot from¬†Guardiola,‚Äù Ten Hag said in February 2019.¬†‚ÄúHis philosophy is sensational, what he did in¬†Barcelona,¬†Bayern¬†and now with¬†Manchester City, that attacking and attractive style sees him win a lot. ‚ÄúBayern have become my club. Since Pep, football in Germany is different, I looked at almost every training back then, and I took a lot of methodical lessons on how to transfer his philosophy to the pitch.¬† ‚ÄúI want to have possession and hurt the opponent. It‚Äôs about possession, about movement, about vertical attacking patterns, about pressing, wingers moving into the middle to make room for the full-backs. Everyone is attacking, everyone is defending. It‚Äôs this structure that I‚Äôve tried to implement with¬†Ajax.‚Äù In terms of his preferred formation, Ten Hag employed a 4-4-2 - with a diamond in midfield - during the early years of his coaching career before moving on to a 4-3-3. Now, though, he favours a 4-2-3-1, which will obviously be familiar to United's current squad, given it's the same system used by former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the one which interim manager Ralf Rangnick has also belatedly decided upon. In addition, Ten Hag likes to take into account even the smallest detail, such as the length of grass on the pitch.  ‚ÄúBehind every training session, there was an idea,‚Äù Marnix Kolder, Go Ahead‚Äôs captain at the time,¬†told the Independent. ‚ÄúHe makes every player better. Tactical, physical. Erik left nothing to chance. He was prepared for every opponent, down to the last detail.‚Äù ‚ÄúEvery morning he‚Äôd go to the pitch to see if the grass was high enough,‚Äù added retired midfielder Sjoerd Overgoor. Even Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, holds him in high esteem.  ‚ÄúErik [ten Hag] is rightly regarded as one of the most exciting coaching talents in world football at the moment because of the work he does with Ajax,‚Äù Klopp said in December 2020.¬† ‚ÄúOf course, it is a wonderful club ‚Äì one of the stellar names of European football ‚Äì but in this moment it is clear they have outstanding leadership of the organisation and Erik is a big part of that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/who-is-erik-ten-hag-teams-coached-trophies-won-and/blt2d25b2c16ae996ba,Soham Mukherjee,c0e98b9e-de47-4be5-acd2-41c467897e41
Watch: Garnacho follows up Man Utd senior debut with stunning chipped goal in U23s clash with Liverpool,"Alejandro Garnacho continues to show why he is held in such high regard by Manchester United, with the 17-year-old following up a senior debut for the Red Devils with an impressive chipped goal for the club‚Äôs U23 side in a meeting with Liverpool. The talented teenager, who has already broken into the full Argentina squad, made his Premier League bow off the bench in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford ‚Äì as he came on to partner Cristiano Ronaldo in attack during the close stages of that game. His intention is to see many more minutes over the coming years, as Erik ten Hag prepares to inherit first-team reins from Ralf Rangnick, but for now his focus is locked on catching the eye at youth level ‚Äì with a prominent role played for United‚Äôs U18 side this season in their run to the FA Youth Cup final. Having stepped back down from the senior fold for now, Garnacho was among the goals on Sunday during a clash with Liverpool. Alejandro Garnacho's goal against Liverpool U23s pic.twitter.com/wC1qLy7LLl He figured against the Reds as part of a side that also included Alvaro Fernandez and Hannibal Mejbri, with United continuing to see highly-rated talent drop off a fabled conveyor belt. Garnacho‚Äôs strike against Liverpool further highlighted why he is held in such high regard, as he raced through on goal to finish with aplomb. The Red Devils would go on to lose the game 3-1, but that is all part of a steep learning curve for a Madrid-born youngster that is now rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Lionel Messi with club and country.

The 29-year-old has outlined exactly what he is looking for from his next club in an interview with UNINTERRUPTED - the athlete empowerment brand founded by basketball legend Lebron James and American businessman Maverick Carter. ‚ÄúI just want the best for me, I‚Äôm thinking like putting everything together,"" said Pogba. ""Take my time and I‚Äôm just looking for the best. I just want to play football, be myself always and enjoy what I do.  ""I need to enjoy what I do because otherwise I cannot perform well. I don‚Äôt want to be thinking negative.  ""We can be losing games, losing trophies but you have to be happy where you are and enjoy yourself. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for."" Pogba was a divisive figure throughout his United career, with his commitment to the collective cause called into question due to his perceived love of the spotlight away from the pitch. The World Cup winner was even booed and told to ""f*ck off"" by a section of supporters during a 3-2 home win against Norwich last season, and he has now stressed the importance of feeling ""appreciated"" in order to perform at the highest possible level. ""As long as you click first of all with the team, the fans, with the club that knows you and loves you. When you're free mentally, you enjoy yourself and that's when you perform,"" Pogba added. ""Everyone wants to feel loved, everybody needs that, your soul needs that. Its always good to feel that the work you do is appreciated.  ""People around make a huge difference because they can cheer you up or bring you down.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/everybody-wants-to-feel-loved-pogba-juventus-psg-barcelona/bltaed6afa570789e49,James Westwood,33db010a-ea0d-4fa0-9dae-9bc21095e6fc
Rabiot not joining Juventus on pre-season tour of United States for 'personal reasons',"Adrien Rabiot has confirmed that he won't be joining Juventus on their pre-season tour of the United States due to ""personal reasons"". The midfielder will remain in Italy to work on his fitness instead of participating in the club's upcoming trio of friendly matches. Rabiot was a key part of Massimiliano Allegri's squad last season as he appeared in 45 games across all competitions, but won't be joining his team-mates for fixtures against Deportivo Guadalajara, Barcelona and Real Madrid over the next 11 days. The Frenchman took to social media to confirm his absence, which is not performance or injury-related. ""In agreement with the club and for personal reasons, I will stay in Italy to finish my physical training,"" Rabiot wrote on Instagram. Juve are due to return to Italy after facing Real in Los Angeles on July 31, with their final pre-season match against Atletico Madrid scheduled to take place eight days later.

Why Lampard's Everton are likely to lose relegation battle with Burnley and Leeds,"Relegation from the Premier League does not always mean disaster.¬† Norwich City and Watford are clubs who expect to yo-yo and most likely they will both be promoted again next season, much in the way Fulham and Bournemouth ‚Äì with their vast transfer budgets compared to the rest of the Championship ‚Äì are currently in first and second. But relegation does not mean the same thing to all teams.¬† Burnley, again, will consider themselves likely to come straight back up, and yet ending their six-year stay in the Premier League without Sean Dyche at the helm is problematic. There is every chance their identity will start to fade without Dyche, and Burnley hardly have the finances to ensure their long-term future lies in the top flight.¬† Leeds United are in a similar situation: they could easily fall back into the Championship abyss without Marcelo Bielsa leading them. Everton are undoubtedly in the most daunting position.  The club have posted huge financial losses recently, are in the process of building a new stadium, and have a wage bill that is simply unsustainable in the Championship.¬† Everything from bankruptcy to Sunderland-like collapse is plausible should they go down. Unfortunately, analysis of the remaining fixtures suggests Everton are the most likely to finish 18th... Mike Jackson has won ten points from his first four games in charge of Burnley, in what amounts to one of the most surprising new manager bounces in Premier League history.¬† Few thought Sean Dyche was doing much wrong; nobody thought Burnley would improve without him. Tactically, little has changed beyond doubling down on the simpler aspects of the Dyche approach.¬† Burnley remain in a stubborn and direct 4-4-2, while Jackson has stuck to a consistent team selection in which Jack Cork and Nathan Collins have stood out. The Cork and Josh Brownhill partnership brings dependability as Burnley sweep up loose balls, waste no time in spraying passes out wide, and then launch it up to their two target men.¬† Their good form ought to continue, given that Burnley face two games against an Aston Villa side badly struggling of late and with very little to play for. Steven Gerrard's diamond 4-4-2 is leaving too much space in the wide areas during open play, making them particularly vulnerable to Burnley's tactic of shifting the ball wide before launching high balls into the box. What's more, Collins and James Tarkowski should out-muscle Villa's tepid forwards, all of whom are looking too lightweight at the moment. Philippe Coutinho certainly won't enjoy such rough matches. There is enough of a physical and psychological distance between the sides for Burnley to get four points from this double header, which should bring survival. Leeds are slowly being dragged back into the relegation battle as Burnley and Everton unexpectedly record wins, but Jesse Marsch is doing a good job at Elland Road and supporters need not be disheartened by one poor result against Manchester City. Marsch has kept a lot of the Bielsa ideas, particularly in regards to the speed of their attacks and the specific patterns of their interplay ‚Äì which are etched into muscle memory at Leeds and make them very attractive to watch. But he has dropped the defensive line 20 yards, has stopped the players from pressing in all areas of the pitch, and has switched out the man-to-man pressing with a more sensible zonal system.¬† These subtle changes have ended the madness, and put them in a strong position to beat opponents who have little to play for. Arsenal at the Emirates is likely to end in defeat, but Chelsea at home no longer looks like a difficult match following their defeat to Everton at the weekend.¬† Thomas Tuchel's side cannot wait for the season to end, and have shown an alarming defensive vulnerability as they switch off.¬† Like Arsenal in their 4-2 win, Leeds can make the most of a high Chelsea defensive line struggling with injuries.¬† In their final two, Leeds face Brighton and Brentford, two teams drifting in mid-table and unlikely to fight as hard as Marsch's team.¬† Everton continue to play without any purpose, structure, or cohesion under Frank Lampard unless allowed to sit in an ultra-defensive formation against 'Big Six' clubs.¬† They are playing considerably worse than Burnley and Leeds but are still clinging on thanks to 1-0 wins against Manchester United and Chelsea.¬† A final day trip to the Emirates is one more chance at these kinds of heroics, although it doesn't seem likely to be successful given Arsenal have a top-four place on the line. Making use of the noise inside Goodison Park is Everton's only hope, but they will be forced to sit higher and hold the majority of possession against Brentford and Crystal Palace.¬† That leaves them open to the bullishness of Ivan Toney and the trickery of Wilfried Zaha; Everton have never played well in this kind of game under Lampard. A trip to Leicester City is a chance to win a point, while by-then-relegated Watford host Everton in a fortnight's time.¬† And yet Everton will need to suddenly learn how to play expansively if they are to win the latter. Lampard's tactical coaching is virtually non-existent; his Everton team hopelessly passive unless galvanised by the simplicity of a backs-to-the-wall mission.¬† There aren't enough of these left to save them.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lampard-everton-likely-lose-relegation-battle-burnley-leeds/blt6da5d80096134faf,Alex Keble,36998a9b-0044-462f-941e-b061c6bc0182

"Saliba deserves his chance at Arsenal, says Mertesacker","Mikel Arteta should give William Saliba a chance in the Arsenal first team in the coming season, says Per Mertesacker. The centre-back returned to north London this summer after an impressive season on loan at Marseille. The French side wanted to keep Saliba on a permanent basis, but he expressed his desire to return to the Gunners and fight for his place in the team, and youth academy director Mertesacker believes he has earned his shot. ‚ÄúWhat William has done in Marseille is magnificent,‚Äù the former defender told HaytersTV. ‚ÄúSo for us to really test him this summer and see what‚Äôs best for him. ‚ÄúHe has clearly made his mark with his young age, with his playing in a major league in Europe and being one of the best players says it all. So why not use him?‚Äù Saliba joined Arsenal from Saint-Etienne in 2019 but has not made a senior appearance for the club. Instead, he was sent back on loan to Saint-Etienne and then to Nice and Marseille. He played a key role for the Ligue 1 side last season, making 51 appearances in all competitions and was asked about joining the club permanently. However, both Saliba and Arteta insisted that his future was with the Premier League side, with the 21-year-old saying in June: ""I belong to Arsenal, and I still have two years there. I will be there for pre-season with Arsenal. ""I have played zero matches with Arsenal and I want to show them what I‚Äôm made of and have the chance to play for the supporters and for this big club."" Meanwhile, Arteta maintained the 21-year-old needed the year at Marseille to get ready to claim a place in the Gunners team.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/saliba-deserves-his-chance-at-arsenal-says-mertesacker/blt01791b687fcf69ea,Peter McVitie,097d8cf1-f30e-4b36-9f11-f9b3ae528d10
"What comes next for Bielsa - America, Australia or president of Argentina?!","February marked the end of an era at Elland Road, and possibly the last hurrah for one of football's most engaging characters. Marcelo Bielsa was relieved of his duties at Leeds United following a damaging run of defeats which left the club on the verge of the Premier League relegation zone; but there were few recriminations towards the Argentine from the supporters. Instead, there were tears, warm farewells and no little anger at the club for letting go a man who had captured fans' hearts during his near-four years years on the bench.  Even as Bielsa made his way back home across the Atlantic Ocean, his presence was still being felt in banners and signs commemorating his unforgettable tenure, while in Argentina speculation had already begun over what, if any, his next job would be.  One rather curious proposition came from the editor of Clarin, the nation's largest-circulation newspaper, who in an opinion column, and seemingly only half in jest, threw Bielsa's hat in the ring to become the next president of Argentina.  The Rosario native, as is his wont, offered no words to reporters once back on home soil, nor did he offer any hint of what to expect in the future. But there were no few observers who were happy to do El Loco's talking for him, both in Argentina and further afield. One potential employer emerged from a rather unexpected source: Mexican Formula One driver Sergio Checo Perez, a diehard fan of Club America and on close terms with the side's current owners. ‚ÄúI would love Marcelo Bielsa for America, but it is not up to me,‚Äù the Red Bull driver told ESPN when asked who he wished to see succeed ex-Real Madrid boss, Bielsa's compatriot Santiago Solari, who recently parted ways with the club after just over a year in charge. ‚ÄúWhy not? Everything is possible for America.‚Äù Another tantalising, if equally hypothetical job opportunity was dangled in front of Bielsa's eyes a little closer to home. Godoy Cruz, based in the famous wine-growing region of Mendoza near the border between Argentina and Chile, currently employ one of Bielsa's many proteges across the world of football: Diego Flores, his long-time collaborator and translator at the likes of Marseille, Lille and Leeds. According to reports, Flores would remain in day-to-day charge of the club, who have been entertaining to watch if not always consistent during his six months at the helm (remind you of anyone?), while his former mentor would enter in a more advisory, directorial role upstairs. Would such a proposal tempt the veteran? Bielsa was indeed effusive with his praise of Flores when he took the job in Mendoza, stating that: ‚ÄúDiego Flores' best virtues are not related to his time with our coaching staff. He is a person who built himself up. ‚ÄúBoth Diego Flores and [fellow ex-assistant and current Huddersfield Town boss] Carlos Corberan are very valuable people and have strong personalities to assume the responsibility of coaching.‚Äù Whether the famously obsessive, detail-driven coach would accept taking a back seat in training and on matchdays, though, seems unlikely at this stage. A similar caveat would be in place for a return to international football, where he previously trained Argentina and Chile, becoming a national hero for the latter. Having previously expressed a wish to take the reins at Australia, it was not a surprise to see his name linked with the Socceroos almost as soon as he was dismissed, especially given their current struggles in World Cup qualifying.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need a new coach, we need a revolution. He‚Äôs a revolutionary,‚Äù ex-Australia man Craig Foster said to Stan Sport. ‚ÄúAustralia needs something special, we need something different, we need better thinking. Small nations like us, we can‚Äôt be the same. He has the strength to be able to do that.‚Äù  But at 66, it is difficult to see Bielsa submit himself to his third four-year World Cup cycle as a coach, particularly for a post on the other side of the globe and in uncharted territory for him. In the short term at least, Bielsa will most likely take an extended break from the game following the stress and rigour of two taxing Premier League campaigns, complicated even further by the ravages of Covid-19.  Should he return, as those closest to him trust he will do, it will be as always on his terms, having performed an exhaustive investigation of his next employer and convinced that he can make a positive difference given the opportunity and resources. One thing is certain, however. Should he opt to stay in football ‚Äì and to be honest it is difficult to see such a die-hard student and fanatic of the game simply walk away ‚Äì Bielsa will have no shortage of offers from across the planet.  His Leeds spell may have ended in disappointment rather than triumph, but he remains a legend of the game and a man who can transform a team with his encyclopaedic knowledge and unique, at times infuriating but ultimately endearing personality.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bielsa-america-australia-president-argentina/blt963a756cfa6e3e24,Daniel Edwards,d5b2a01a-0249-4e3e-93fe-5ad9819374be
Ten Hag leaves Ajax to get early Man Utd start 'because a lot of things need to be dealt with',"Erik ten Hag has confirmed that he will start at Manchester United this week, ahead of his expected arrival during the off-season, as the incoming Red Devils manager prepares to lay out his plan to turn the club around under his stewardship. The outgoing Ajax boss announced he would immediately start work following his final Eredivisie game this weekend, with the Dutchman headed for Old Trafford this week to begin work. Though he was not expected until Ralf Rangnick had officially relinquished the interim head coach position, Ten Hag explained that he wished to come in earlier in order to take stock of pressing matters that have contributed to the Red Devils' decline this term. ""I am switching very rapidly, yes,"" Ten Hag was quoted after his final match in charge of Ajax. ""But is it really necessary, because a lot of things need to be dealt with."" ""I have the energy to carry on after the Dutch season with a new period in Manchester. I am looking forward to dealing with things. ""Of course I need to charge my batteries at some stage, but I will find time for that somewhere in between."" The Dutchman is coming aboard early at Old Trafford in order to present a hands-on approach to reshaping the United squad, as the Red Devils look to reshape their roster following a disappointing season. Several major faces are expected to depart, including Paul Pogba, though Cristiano Ronaldo is thought to be set to stay despite a lack of Champions League football next term. Ten Hag wants to have a guiding hand in discussions with players - both those already on his books and potential transfer targets across the summer window.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ten-hag-leaves-ajax-to-get-early-man-utd-start-because-a-lot/bltcdd8b05ee5ab09bc,Andrew Steel,8ff3dba4-63e5-4d23-9343-0033601390cc
Ronaldo tips Mbappe to be 'number one' & reacts to Real Madrid transfer rumours,"Former Real Madrid striker Ronaldo has tipped Paris Saint-Germain talisman Kylian Mbappe to become the ""number one"" player in world football, while he also reacted to the rumours linking the Frenchman with a move to Santiago Bernabeu.  Mbappe has already achieved so much in his career despite only turning 23 in December, winning Ligue 1 titles at both Monaco and PSG while also becoming a World Cup winner at international level with France. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have led the way as the standout players of their generation over the last 15 years, but the latter's namesake thinks Mbappe is well on his way to reaching the same status in his own era. Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or twice during a glittering career that saw him take in successful spells at Inter, Barcelona and Real Madrid while also lifting the 2002 World Cup. The Brazilian is jealous of the financial rewards players in the modern era receive compared to when he was in his prime, but admits that stars like Mbappe are deserving of the extra compensation for their excellence. ""He is very strong, he has that speed and coolness in front of goal that will lead him to be number one,""¬†Ronaldo¬†said on¬†Christian Vieri's Twitch channel Bobo TV. ""And I have read the news that he will go to¬†Real Madrid¬†and earn 50 million [euros] a year. We were part of the wrong generation! ""The football industry is growing so much that it's only fair that the stars receive more and more money. If it's like that today, it's because there were players who inspired them, like we did."" Mbappe was the subject of three mega-money bids from Real Madrid last summer, the last of which reportedly exceeded the ‚Ç¨200 million (¬£167m/$226m) mark. PSG refused to sanction the striker's departure, but he revealed at the start of the season that he had pushed for the move due to a desire to take on a new challenge away from France. Mbappe is now only five months away from his contract expiration date and Madrid are expected to snap him up when he becomes a free agent. However, the France international has also left the door open to potentially extending his stay at Parc des Princes, as he told Amazon Prime when quizzed on his future in December: ""I don't know. Today I have to take the time. It is not easy. Either way, I'll be playing for a big club. ""At first I was disappointed [not to leave]. But, well, I am not in the third division, I am in a club that wants to win the Champions League. I am Parisian, I have my family, I feel good, I have always said it.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-mbappe-number-one-reacts-real-madrid-transfer/bltbc9750451458ef3d,James Westwood,82c83677-af4d-4c02-9abd-db8becf94de7
Arda Guler: The Turkish wonderkid the whole of Europe wants to sign,"In what is one of world football's most intense atmospheres, it takes a lot to stand out within the stands at a Fenerbahce-Galatasaray match. And yet when the Istanbul rivals met on April 10, one banner stood out among all the rest inside the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium. ""Arda Guler: The Turkish Messi,"" it read, held aloft by Max, a 20-year-old who had travelled from London to be at one of the most passionate games anywhere in world football. ""I went to Barcelona to watch Messi before and it was really great to see him,"" Max explained to GOAL. ""So I thought Arda Guler, who is my favourite Fenerbahce player in the biggest game of the season, would deserve this nickname!"" The banner garnered so much interest not only due to a Turkish teenager being compared to a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner and perhaps the greatest footballer of all time, but because Arda has become the hottest property in Turkish football in recent weeks. His Fenerbahce team-mate Mesut Ozil - who Arda has also been compared to - described the 17-year-old as having the potential to become ""a world star"", and it would seem that some of Europe's biggest clubs agree. Arsenal and Liverpool reportedly sent scouts to watch the playmaker in action against Galatasaray, while Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have already been touted as future destinations for a player who is regarded as being the best to emerge in Turkish football for some time. That is all some leap from the toddler whose father used to place balloons in front of him at his home in Ankara in an attempt to get Arda to kick them with his left foot. ""We did not have any left-footers in our family,"" Umit Guler explains to GOAL. ""I put balloons and footballs in front of his left foot so he would use it more."" Arda was certainly given all the help he needed to become a footballer by his family, and his talents were spotted as early as his second year of primary school, when his physical education teacher suggested he join Genclerbirligi's academy. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: ""Genclerbirligi's training facilities were very far from our home,"" Umit recalls. ""We took Arda there with his teacher‚Äôs insistence, and he managed to show off his talents in the first training session. They put him in their team immediately!"" That team was actually made up of boys that were a year older than Arda, but he soon became captain as his supreme talents allowed him to stand out from the rest. His abilities were spotted by Fenerbahce in 2019 at an Under-14s tournament hosted in Riva, around 50 kilometres (31 miles) outside of Istanbul, and the offer was soon made for him to make the 440km (273 miles) move to the Yellow Canaries. ""In December 2018, I went to Ankara to watch the Osmanlispor-Genclerbirligi U14s game,"" Serhat Pekmezci, the former youth coordinator at Fenerbache, explained to Haber Global. ""I was scouting another player. However, Arda caught my attention, as both his skills and character impressed me. ""Although he suffered a serious ankle injury in the last 15 minutes, he did not quit the game. They lost the match and he shed tears at the end of the match. ""He had very special potential. We told our sporting director at that time, Damien Comolli, about Arda with a special report. He was a talent not to be missed so we should sign him. ""Nearly 10 days later, after not receiving any response from the board, I prepared a video of Arda and forwarded it to our chairman, Ali Koc. He made contact with me after watching him. ""My first statement to him was, 'at the age of 15 or 16, he can be playing in the first team', and not only mentioned that he was a European-class talent, but I also talked about his quality off the pitch."" A boyhood Fener fan who idolised Alex de Souza growing up, Arda jumped at the opportunity, and though he struggled with homesickness to begin with, his family followed him to Istanbul around six months later to help him settle properly. The Covid-enforced shutdown of football in the first half of 2020 delayed Arda's start to life at his new club, but once he was able to showcase his abilities, he was soon promoted from the U17s squad to the U19s. He enjoyed a superb campaign despite playing against opponents who were up to four years older than him, scoring 10 goals and laying on seven assists in just 22 appearances. Unsurprisingly, that form caught the eye of first-team coach Vitor Pereira, who invited the youngster to train with the first team after Arda signed his first professional contract in January 2021. It was not until August, though, that he would make his senior bow, coming off the bench for the final 24 minutes against HJK Helsinki in Europa League qualifying. Three days later, he marked his league debut against Antalyaspor with an assist. ""If you want to improve young players, you need to give them playing time and confidence,"" Pereira said following Arda's debut. ""If you provide these and the players have the quality, they can shine. ""I worked in Porto‚Äôs academy for five years and I can say that I did not see many players who had Arda‚Äôs quality and character."" While the Messi and Ozil comparisons make for good headlines, perhaps the player Arda most resembles is ex-Real Madrid midfielder Guti, who spent the final year of his career in Turkey at Besiktas. He is blessed with a maturity in possession that belies a player who only turned 17 in February, with his cultured left foot and vision ensuring that he is able to produce passes that others could only dream of making. A superb dribbler, as highlighted by the mazy run and assist he provided against Slavia Prague in February, and an assured finisher, it is clear by Arda's first touch and decision making that he is able to process what he is going to do with the ball well before it reaches him. Off the field, he is able to compartmentalise and switch off from the hype that surrounds him, ensuring he stays calm and is able to relax. After he provided another assist in the return leg against Slavia, for example, he spent the evening playing FIFA with one of his former team-mates from the U19s. As the season has worn on, he has earned more and more opportunities to impress within the Fenerbahce first team, and became the youngest goalscorer in the club's history when he volleyed in from close range against Alanyaspor in March. He backed that up by curling in a 20-yard effort against Kayserispor two games later, with the teenager having averaged a goal or assist every 45 minutes he has been on the pitch during his first season of senior football. The battle for Fenerbahce now is to keep hold of their prized asset, who has a ‚Ç¨30 million (¬£25m/$32.5m) release clause within his contract. ""I don‚Äôt think Arda will stay in Turkey too long,‚Äù Erol Tokgozler, Guler‚Äôs former coach at Genclerbirligi, told CNN Turk. ‚ÄúI know that there are offers from Arsenal and Bayern Munich. ""With each passing match, the number of these teams will increase. [Bids of] ‚Ç¨20-30m for Arda will become ordinary."" So too, in all likelihood, will adoration from the stands, whether via banners, songs or comparisons with greats of the game. Right now, you would not bet against Arda joining them one day.

Lionesses star Kirby keen for 'surreal' Euro 2022 fever to energise England support,"England forward Fran Kirby says the team hope they can continue to help the nation celebrate as they angle for a first major final in over a dozen years, with the Chelsea attacker admitting it has been a ""surreal"" experience as Euro 2022 fever grips the nation.

Sarina Wiegman's side mounted a sensational extra-time fightback to defeat Spain in the quarter-finals and Kirby is aware of the feelgood factor she and her team-mates are helping to contribute to, particularly amid a trying summer for the public, especially if they can go all the way. ‚ÄúIf we get the chance to win in the semi-final and get through to the final, I think it will be incredible for people in this country to have something to celebrate and enjoy,‚Äù the forward was quoted by the Guardian. ""As much as we want to win, we want to put a smile on people‚Äôs faces. ""They may be going through a hard time in terms of the rising fuel costs and the cost of living right now. Hopefully we can give people an escape for 90-plus minutes when they turn their TVs on, they will have something to cheer about and will see how passionately we play for this country. ""Hopefully it gives them a sense of pride and they can switch off from everything that is going on. It‚Äôs a bit surreal when you‚Äôre just walking down the street and people are out the windows clapping you. Hopefully it means that we‚Äôre making people proud and we‚Äôre inspiring them and showing them what women‚Äôs football can do in this country.‚Äù It's going to take a good team to stop England at #WEURO2022 üî• pic.twitter.com/4Io4Jh4SLL A year after Gareth Southgate's side slipped to penalty shootout heartbreak, their counterparts - a prolific last-four major tournament presence under Wiegman's predecessor Phil Neville, yet unable to make that penultimate step to the final - are in a familiar semi-final position. Kirby is aware England's spectacular group stage results set expectations, but the attacker is hopeful they can deliver on them, adding: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a difficult one because we have been here before and done this previously so you could say there is that expectation there. For us, and me personally, I know how tough tournaments are and how difficult it is. I wouldn‚Äôt say there is an expectation from us to get there, even if people expect it from us. The standard of women‚Äôs football is rising every year. We know when we beat a team like Norway like we did [8-0 in the group stage] that people are going to start talking about us winning the tournament.‚Äù That late equaliser feeling üòÖ #WEURO2022 pic.twitter.com/ErUQ7thoBt",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lionesses-star-kirby-keen-for-surreal-euro-2022-fever-to/blt83f7cf7cf5b05223,Andrew Steel,6eefa987-145f-4fa4-820c-7632cad32a39
2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Nigeria government mobilises fans for Ghana showdown,"Nigeria government has taken steps to mobilise 60,000 fans to support the Super Eagles for the crucial 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifying match against Ghana on Tuesday. The Office of the Head of Service of the Federation has directed all offices to close at 1pm on Tuesday, in order to enable public servants to go to the Moshood Abiola Stadium to cheer on Augustine Eguavoen's men. This is in addition to the efforts made by the Nigeria Football Federation and the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development who have purchased 20,000 tickets for fans to watch the game in the stadium. They have also made provision for the free transportation of fans from around Abuja to the stadium, with about 24 designated pick-up locations. The West African countries will face off at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium for the return fixture after they settled for a goalless draw in Kumasi last Friday. The Super Eagles have only defeated Ghana once in their last six games, which came at the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations through Taye Taiwo's 86th-minute effort. The last time they met in a World Cup qualifier was in 2001 when Nigeria won 3-0 at home after they held the Black Stars to a goalless draw in Accra.

Rice 'delighted' for Yarmolenko and keen to face Barcelona as West Ham progress in Europa League,"Declan Rice said he was especially ""delighted"" for Andriy Yarmolenko after West Ham progressed in the Europa League and admitted eyeing a potential tie with Barcelona next. West Ham reached their first European quarter-final since 1981 after beating Sevilla 2-0 after extra-time at London Stadium on Thursday night. David Moyes' side advanced 2-1 on aggregate thanks to Yarmolenko's 112th-minute goal, which sparked emotional scenes of celebration amid his country's ongoing conflict with Russia.  Ukraine international Yarmolenko was granted compassionate leave by West Ham following Russia's invasion, and netted his first goal since returning to action in a 2-1 win against Aston Villa on March 13. The Hammers faithful were right behind the 32-year-old once again after his decisive strike against Sevilla, and he was visibly moved as Rice and the rest of his team-mates embraced him. Rice expressed his admiration towards Yarmolenko post-match, telling BT Sport: ‚ÄúYarmolenko was a little bit emotional away from the lads afterwards. For what he‚Äôs been through to perform like this ‚Äì his desire, the way he chased players and scored. He deserves this. He stepped up. I‚Äôm delighted for him.‚Äù West Ham have joined Barca, Atalanta, RB Leipzig, Lyon, Braga, Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt in the last eight of this season's Europa League. Barca are favourites to lift the trophy after coming through their round of 16 tie with Galatasaray, and Rice says the Hammers would love the chance to head to Camp Nou. ‚ÄúMe and the guys fancy the Nou Camp, we‚Äôve heard they do some nice paella down there!‚Äù the midfielder said when quizzed on his preferred quarter-final opponents. ‚ÄúIt would be special to go there and face Barcelona.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rice-yarmolenko-barcelona-west-ham-europa-league/blt339230180ae30991,James Westwood,6c15e6f1-1e94-4a7d-904c-d4c6152bfb18
"Pepi's continued rise, Clark's chance and five things to watch in the USMNT's clash with Bosnia & Herzegovina","It's been quite a year for the U.S. men's national team.  They've won the Gold Cup and Nations League, they're sitting fairly comfortably in a World Cup qualifying berth and, with a win over Bosnia & Herzegovina on Saturday, they'll seal the record for most wins in a calendar year in program history. However, Saturday's game isn't about closing 2021 on a high note; it's about building a foundation for 2022 and, perhaps most importantly, beyond. Like most winter friendlies, this gathering also presents an opportunity to keep MLS players, and a few choice international-based players, fit in their offseason, while maybe widening the player pool just a bit. With those goals in mind, Gregg Berhalter has called in a squad loaded with young talent, but also one that features a few key regulars that will be a big part of World Cup qualifiers.  So, with that said, here's a look at five players and storylines to watch with the USMNT... What a whirlwind of a year it has been for Ricardo Pepi! He's truly broken through as an MLS star and a USMNT regular, having quickly gone from young prospect to one of the most talked-about players in North American soccer. However, while 2021 may be coming to an end, Pepi's big moments are just beginning as he faces some important decisions in the coming weeks. This camp is a chance for Pepi to stay fresh and build towards the January qualifiers, where he will likely once again be a key part of Berhalter's plans. But it's his club future that remains the hottest topic of all. Pepi is widely expected to soon head to Europe, but that doesn't appear to be a foregone conclusion. FC Dallas president Dan Hunt recently told Al Dia that the club plans to keep hold of Pepi, as they believe it will be best for the striker and for his national team future. ""Berhalter and other head coaches around the world have shown that if players aren‚Äôt participating in their clubs, they‚Äôll be excluded from their respective national teams,‚Äù Hunt said. ‚ÄúRicardo‚Äôs future is incredible, but I think the best Ricardo can do for his career is continue his process [in Dallas]. He‚Äôs still very young.‚Äù¬† Where Pepi's next step lies remains to be seen, but this camp and this game is another chance for him to shine on the national team stage while continuing to fortify his spot as the USMNT's No. 9 of the present and future. In a perfect world, Caden Clark would have made his USMNT debut months ago. The RB Leipzig-bound star had been tipped to play at this summer's Gold Cup, building off a breakthrough 2020 that vaulted him right into the spotlight. But this isn't a perfect world, and so Clark is ready for his USMNT debut as he prepares to also make the big move to Europe. An appendectomy took him out of action for the summer, robbing him of that Gold Cup chance while also forcing him to rediscover fitness and form as the MLS season wore on. But Clark seems back to his old self now, having played well down the stretch in MLS. Clark is a dynamic attacking player that is as smooth as they come on the ball. He has the technical skill and, perhaps most importantly, the confidence to just try things, and that combination is one that could make him vital to the USMNT for years to come. It remains to be seen if its too late for a young player like Clark to surge up Berhalter's depth chart just one year out for the World Cup. But this camp is a chance for him to stake his claim. It has been over two years since Jordan Morris has represented the USMNT. Much has changed in the interim. This young USMNT, in many ways, has grown up, with new faces becoming stars. So, the question is now obvious: where does Morris fit in all of this? Before his injury, an absolutely heartbreaking ACL tear, Morris seemed like he could be key to the U.S. team.  Morris had also sealed a big move to Europe, joining Swansea in an effort to prove that he had the talent and ambition to compete in this new-look USMNT squad. But then came the ACL injury, one that he is still very much recovering from. He returned in time to appear at the tail end of the MLS season against all odds, but it's highly unlikely that Morris is anywhere near 100 percent. However, even when he is, will he still have a role to play in a full-strength squad that features wingers like Christian Pulisic, Brenden Aaronson, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Paul Arriola and Konrad de la Fuente? Is there a place for Morris in a potential World Cup squad? ""For me, it's just trying to get back to my best and try to get back part of that group,"" Morris said. ""That was a big goal of mine throughout my rehab. The main goal was to recover, get back to my best as quickly as possible and try and get back in with this group because that just means everything."" There's a fairly good chance that Cade Cowell could just be the next speedster to break into the USMNT picture. Cowell is with the U.S. after training with the team during the Gold Cup, but this is his first real chance to earn playing time under Berhalter. He's got every chance of doing so, as Cowell is perhaps the most athletically-gifted prospect the U.S. has, which is saying something. He can play anywhere across the front three, having shown some very good signs of development early in the MLS season.  He's far from a finished product, and his hold up play and connecting play can still use some work, but Cowell has all of the potential in the world after turning just 18 in October. Given his skillset, Cowell has all the potential to be a player that rises rapidly through the USMNT ranks. Think DeAndre Yedlin ahead of the 2014 World Cup or Jordan Morris just after it. When you have something as awe-inspiring as that level of pace, you can easily figure out the rest as you go along. It remains to be seen if Cowell can make that case in the year to come or if he's a player that would be better suited to the youth teams for the foreseeable future. But he is the type of player that could truly use this camp as a springboard if everything goes his way. It's safe to say Bryan Reynolds' season at Roma hasn't gone to plan. The former FC Dallas star has struggled to impress coach Jose Mourinho, becoming the latest young player to find himself in the Special One's doghouse. Amid a topsy turvy season of referee criticism, lackluster results and frequent complaints about squad depth, Reynolds hasn't been spared by Mourinho, who has clearly indicated that he doesn't believe the defender is ready for the top level. ""We don't have the changes of the other teams like Inter. Reynolds is a kid,"" Mourinho said in September, before adding: ""I put Reynolds because he was the only full-back. If Ibanez had been on the bench, I would have put him in, but he wasn't there."" In total, Reynolds has made just three appearances all season. Two of those came in the Europa Conference League. It's clear that Reynolds isn't in the coach's plans at the moment, with reports saying that the fullback will be loaned out in January. That's far from a bad thing, especially for a 20-year-old defender with two-ish years of professional experience.  But this is a big crossroads for Reynolds, who will need to use the next six months to prove himself to both his club and the national team after rising so rapidly in MLS.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/five-things-to-watch-in-the-usmnt-clash-with-bosnia-and/bltae1b3a1f0b49282e,Ryan Tolmich,19a28a9f-f1f1-4693-be3b-8dd99e23f2e5
Russia bids for Euro 2028 and 2032 confirmed by UEFA despite Ukraine invasion,"Russia have registered their interest in hosting Euro 2028 and 2032, rivalling UK and Ireland's joint bid for the former tournament despite being hit with a ban from all football competitions by UEFA. The UK and Ireland have joined forces to bid for the hosting rights for the European Championship in six years' time, formally declaring their interest ahead of the March 23 deadline. The five football associations from England, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales had initially emerged as the sole bidders, but Russia have now also stepped forward at the last minute. In a statement on Wednesday evening, UEFA confirmed that Russia and Turkey were making separate bids for both the 2028 and 2032 tournaments, while UK-Ireland were bidding for 2028 while Italy were confirmed as wanting to host in 2032. The statement read: ""UEFA today confirmed that it has received declarations of interest to host the 2028 and 2032 editions of the Euros from four potential bidders following the deadline of March 23. ""A joint declaration of interest was submitted by the football associations of England, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales for UEFA Euro 2028. ""Russia and Turkey declared their interest in hosting either the 2028 or 2032 edition of UEFA‚Äôs flagship national team competition, while Italy announced its intention to bid for UEFA Euro 2032. ""The appointment of hosts of UEFA Euro 2028 and 2032 will be made in September 2023."" All Russian clubs and national teams across every age group were suspended indefinitely by UEFA and FIFA in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine last month. The football union of Russia (RFU) is still awaiting the outcome of an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and are technically free to bid for Euro 2028 hosting rights. Following an executive committee meeting on Wednesday, the union released a post of the results on its official website that included an agreement to ""support the decision to declare interest in hosting the European Championship 2028 or 2032 in Russia"". Rustem Saymanov, a member of the RFU executive committee, has also confirmed that it is interested in hosting the tournament in 2032 and that the bid is a serious one despite the escalating military conflict in Ukraine. ‚ÄúThe RFU is going to apply for the European Championships in 2028 and 2032, this is not a joke, yes. Life goes on with us, we are open and ready, we should not be closed to UEFA and FIFA,"" said Saymanov. ‚ÄúWe have held many competitions at a high level. Let's go, I admit that there is a lot of time, the situation will change, we will study everything.""

WATCH: Man Utd star Varane reveals the best player he's ever come up against,"Few footballers have played in as many big matches as Raphael Varane. A four-time Champions League winner who also has a World Cup winners' medal to his name, the Manchester United defender has come up against pretty much every elite forward from around the world over the past decade. So when GOAL asked Varane who the best player he has ever come up against was, we imagined it might be a difficult call to make. We were wrong. ""Messi. Do you know Messi?"" Varane joked during his appearance on Simply The Best. ""He's fast, he's a very good striker, and you know about his left foot, so a very, very good player."" So as not to show any favouritism, Varane picked Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player he has ever played with, selecting the Portuguese having appeared alongside him at both United and Real Madrid. It was another ex-Madrid forward, though, that scored the best goal Varane has ever seen live. ""Gareth Bale in the final of the Champions League. It was amazing,"" he said of the Welshman's overhead kick against Liverpool in 2018. üìÖ #OTD in 2018, Gareth Bale did THIS in Kyiv ü§Ø#UCL | @realmadriden | @GarethBale11 pic.twitter.com/wYJ4j5yAFH Check out the full Simply The Best episode with Varane as he reveals the best atmosphere he has played in, as well as who the biggest joker and best dressed players are in the Manchester United dressing room.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-varane-best-player-ever-come-up-against/blt91369c374181152e,Tom Maston,8bad7805-454e-45d5-ac69-472f59949570
What does England's Arnold Clark Cup triumph say about the Lionesses' chances of winning the Euros?,"When the Football Association set up the Arnold Clark Cup, it was to prepare England for this summer‚Äôs UEFA Women‚Äôs European Championships. Olympic gold medallists Canada were invited. Eight-time European champions Germany joined them on the guestlist ‚Äì as did Spain, a national team on the rise. After six games, it was England that emerged as winners, drawing with Canada and Spain, before beating Germany 3-1 on Wednesday night. How much did this tell us about the Lionesses‚Äô chances of winning the Euros? It‚Äôs hard to know. The first few months of head coach Sarina Wiegman‚Äôs tenure has consisted of World Cup qualifiers in which her team hasn‚Äôt conceded once, but has scored 53 times. This, then, was the international window where her team would really be tested, facing three nations ranked among the world‚Äôs top 10. There have been real positives. The first half performance against Canada was exhilarating and worth the stir it caused among the England fans. Unbeaten ‚úÖ Beaten a bogey team in the process üá©üá™Eyes now heading towards the Euros üëÄThe @Lionesses have won the @ArnoldClarkCup üèÜüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø pic.twitter.com/qRsmqJmOh6 The double pivot partnership of Leah Williamson and Keira Walsh ‚Äì one of the things Wiegman wanted to test out the most in this competition ‚Äì was key, with Lauren Hemp electric out wide. In the clash with Spain, Wiegman made nine changes. Playing the strongest opponent in the tournament, it was a team few expected ‚Äì but when the XI took to the pitch, the idea behind it became clear. Pressing, harrying and running themselves into the ground, they didn‚Äôt allow Spain time on the ball. They disrupted the rhythm of a team that, when in full flow, is pretty difficult to stop. During the 2019 Women‚Äôs World Cup, Wiegman was one of few coaches to come out with a genuinely effective plan to stop the U.S. women‚Äôs national team, who were eventual champions. This was a friendly, but it was a glimpse into the tactical nous she can bring to England. In the final match against Germany, her tactical tweak was certainly a little more English. With the scores 1-1 as it ticked into the last 10 minutes, centre-back Millie Bright went up front and, two minutes later, scored. After Fran Kirby put the gloss on the scoreline in stoppage time, Bright posed for a picture alongside Spain‚Äôs Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner Alexia Putellas and the Golden Boot they would share. A moment none predicted would happen, it was also a glimpse into England‚Äôs shortcomings, which it was also important for this tournament to highlight. The Arnold Clark Cup was a low-scoring affair for all, but there will still be concern about the lack of goals from the forward areas in this England side. ‚ÄúIt doesn't really matter who scores the goals as long as we score a goal,‚Äù Wiegman said earlier this week, before adding: ‚ÄúWe want to do better in our final third and that's about decision making, about connection, about scanning how the situation is too, and then being ruthless.‚Äù Reflecting on this tournament win for the Lionesses is also not complete without the caveat of the strength of two of the elite opponents they faced. Germany were massively limited, missing at least 17 players, and were under-strength and without key experience ‚Äì although still a good side. Canada weren‚Äôt at their best either, with head coach Bev Priestman warning before the tournament that they wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. ‚ÄúI think there is a reality that 50 per cent of our team just started pre-season in North America,‚Äù she said. England could only play what was in front of them though, and they still got plenty out of this past 10 days, including a trophy. ‚ÄúI think we have been able to try out things, to see players in different positions and to develop our style of play against three opponents, but also three different styles of play,‚Äù Wiegman said after her team‚Äôs triumph. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really good to see.‚Äù What does this mean for England‚Äôs chances for the Euros, then? In truth, we probably won‚Äôt know until the tournament kicks off in July, but it has highlighted plenty of strengths and weaknesses for Wiegman ahead of the big kick-off. ‚ÄúI am happy with this tournament - but we got lots of information about ourselves and where we are in our style of play,‚Äù she added. Now, she and her team have just over four months to do the work needed to take advantage of this opportunity to learn. That will be the next crucial step before they can think about turning the Arnold Clark Cup into a major tournament title.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/england-arnold-clark-cup-triumph-lionesses-chances-winning/blt57f5122c143c474a,Ame√© Ruszkai,7596dae9-3bf0-4e49-86c1-68488679985b

The 23-year-old still can't believe that the west London outfit were able to go all the way in Europe's elite competition nine months on, and has reflected on the squad's ""incredible"" post-match celebrations. ""Halfway through the season, if we‚Äôd heard that we‚Äôd win the Champions League, I don't think anyone would have believed you,"" Pulisic told Chelsea's official website. ""It was such an incredible experience. It was special to be able to celebrate with my team-mates. Obviously, that night was incredible. ""The next day, the times we were in with Covid and everything, it was kind of hard because we weren't really able to celebrate too much with our fans. ""I actually flew back to the US almost the next day as I had another tournament I was trying to win [Pulisic and the US succeeded, lifting the Gold Cup]. ""So it was definitely an incredible celebration, an incredible first feeling but then, after that, you're kind of wondering what's next? ""It still like hasn't fully sunk in that we won the Champions League. It‚Äôs such a huge accomplishment."" Chelsea are on course to defend the Champions League trophy in 2021-22, having qualified for the round of 16 as Group H runners-up behind Juventus. Tuchel's side have been given a favourable draw against Lille in the first knockout stage, and Pulisic says the whole squad are united in their determination to repeat their Estadio Do Dragao heroics come May. ""When you think back to last year, it‚Äôs extremely special and makes you proud, but now it‚Äôs about winning it again this year,"" he added. ‚ÄòIt definitely makes us hungry for more this year now and we want to feel that again. I think we're really happy with where the club is at. ""We just want to go out and we want to win, and that is something this club is all about. It‚Äôs special and winning that Champions League really showed that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-usmnt-pulisic-champions-league-win-hasn-t-sunk-in/blt470889bc307d972e,James Westwood,65ace519-1a32-4261-a65a-03bcc29441a2
Aubameyang being sent home to Arsenal from Afcon due to Covid uncertainty,"Gabon captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is being allowed to return to Arsenal in light of the ongoing health problems he continues to encounter at the Africa Cup of Nations. The Gunners skipper has yet to feature in the biennial African football showpiece after testing positive for Covid-19 on January 6, and while he was due to return against Ghana earlier this week, his comeback was blocked on medical grounds. Panthers coach Patrice Neveu has now confirmed to GOAL that the striker will be allowed to return to Arsenal in order for his ongoing health problems ‚Äî and the nature of the Covid-19 residue in his system ‚Äî to be properly assessed. ‚ÄúSince yesterday, the decision was taken to send them home to their club,‚Äù Neveu told GOAL, referring to Aubameyang and team-mate Mario Lemina. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt judge it here [in Cameroon], we can‚Äôt assess the pathology of Covid here.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that Mario returns to Nice and Pierre returns to Arsenal,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a decision that we‚Äôve taken among ourselves.‚Äù The Gabon Football Federation subsequently confirmed in a statement that the players are being released from international duty. ""The Gabonese Football Federation has decided to put the players Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mario Lemina back at the disposition of their clubs in order for them to follow more in-depth exams,"" read a brief communique. Aubameyang, denying rumours his exit was related to indiscipline, wrote on Twitter: ""We have problems that are already complicated to solve, then on top of that there are rumours, in short, we have health to take care of first and foremost, I won't go back to address these false rumours and I sincerely hope that our team will go as far as possible."" Lemina wrote on his Instagram story: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even going to feed the lies which seek to harm. I have nothing to do with them. I have pain upon pain for my national team, which is surrounded by liars seeking a buzz."" Aubameyang tested positive for coronavirus upon his arrival at Yaounde airport, having travelled to Cameroon from Abu Dhabi along with compatriot Lemina. The diagnosis forced him to sit out the Panthers' opener - a 1-0 victory over Comoros - but after returning a negative test, he trained with the team on Thursday ahead of their second Group C game against Ghana. His comeback plans were thwarted only a few hours before kick-off with the Black Stars, after medical tests demonstrated evidence of coronavirus residue in his system. After the match, Gabon told GOAL that they were hopeful that subsequent medical tests would allow both Aubameyang and Lemina to return to action, although sources within the camp revealed on Sunday that subsequent medical tests had not revealed a change in circumstances. The decision was taken on Sunday, ahead of Tuesday's final group meeting with Morocco, to allow both to return to their clubs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very complicated,‚Äù Neveu continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not new to this team, I‚Äôve worked with Gabon for three years, and fortunately Caf gave us the option of having a squad of 28 players. ‚ÄúHowever, losing Pierre-Emerick and Mario, it‚Äôs a lot for this team. We don‚Äôt have the squad of Nigeria or Morocco, and we know we‚Äôre in a hard competition.‚Äù Gabon, who have four points from their opening two matches, are looking to reach the knockout stages of the Nations Cup for the first time since 2012. The Panthers have also been hit by several new infections, including influential forward Denis Bouanga, second-choice goalkeeper Noubi Fotso, full-back David Sambissa, midfielder Serge Ngouali and striker Ulrick Eneme Ella.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aubameyang-s-afcon-is-over-gabon-sending-him-back-to-arsenal/blt671abd8fa5333542,Ed Dove,ea16ef01-d80e-4ffa-925b-dc9ad04a7102
Fulham make Premier League return after sealing promotion as Mitrovic hits 40 goal mark,"Fulham are back in the Premier League as they sealed promotion from the Championship on Tuesday. The Cottagers took down Preston North End 3-0 to earn their spot in England's top-flight while continuing their run towards winning the Championship with four games left to play. Their promotion owes much to the form of Aleksander Mitrovic, who reached the 40-goal mark for the season with a brace against Preston. With the win, Fulham have now secured 86 points after 42 games, sealing promotion while making them the favourites to win the title. Star striker Mitrovic¬†broke the Championship goal record back in February with his 32nd goal of the campaign, and he's gone on to add more since. Now, Mitrovic and co will look forward to a return to the Premier League having been relegated last season after an 18th-place finish. This season marks the second time on the trot that Fulham have bounced right back from relegation, having done the same in 2019-20 after winning the promotion playoffs.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/fulham-premier-league-promotion-mitrovic/bltd5a7fe7baf0dfefb,Ryan Tolmich,718e80b8-5d75-453d-80e7-bbcb75c5dbc1
'This isn't the Mbappe I wanted!' - Everything Real Madrid president has said about PSG striker in explosive interview,"Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has said that Kylian Mbappe is now not the same person that he was trying to sign for the Spanish capital club. Mbappe recently made headlines after signing a new contract with Paris Saint-Germain, despite a protracted saga looking certain to end with the World Cup winner swapping Parc des Princes for the Santiago Bernabeu. With Mbappe now tied to PSG for the foreseeable future, Perez has given details on how the scenario played out. Speaking on El Chiringuito, Perez said: ‚ÄúMbappe conveyed to the whole world his desire, his dream, to play for Real Madrid - he stated that publicly. We wanted to do it in August but it wasn't possible, they wouldn't let him go.  ‚ÄúIt took a long time. We had to wait a year, that year passed and then the situation changed. I think it was due to political pressure and I think it was also economic. ‚Äú[PSG] practically offered him not only to be the leader of the team, but also of the management. It was at that point that we saw it wasn't the same Mbappe that we wanted to sign. He changed his dreams as a result of pressure. ‚ÄúIf a kid is called by the president of a country (Emmanuel Macron), of course it'll affect him. What makes no sense is that he did it at all ‚Äì it influenced him a lot. But he could have succeeded at Real Madrid, just as Zidane did, and still be a source of pride for his country. ‚ÄúI think his mother wanted him to come to Real Madrid, because it was his dream as a little boy. I haven't spoken to her, but they tell us that she it upset. When the circumstances change and a person makes a decision, you have to respect it. He's 23 and was put under a lot of pressure. ‚ÄúHe told me about his decision in a message and I wished him luck. At the moment we are no longer interested because no player in the history of Real Madrid has ever been above the club. We're not going to make exceptions and risk mismanagement. ‚ÄúThis Mbappe is not the Mbappe I wanted. But if he changes... Life can take a thousand turns. I think they confused him and he's very young. I wish the best for him, I don't want anything bad for him. I just believe in the dream. ‚ÄúMadridistas will be disappointed, but the Mbappe who wanted to come to Real Madrid was not this Mbappe.‚Äù Despite all his talk of Mbappe being a different man, Perez did not completely rule out signing the striker in future, adding: ‚ÄúI have never said that it was finished forever between Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid. A lot of things can change in three years.‚Äù Asked if waiting on Mbappe hindered a move for Erling Haaland, Perez replied: ‚ÄúIt had nothing to do with it. We have the best centre-forward in the world (Karim Benzema) and at the moment he's incompatible with Haaland. We have a great team. ‚ÄúFor the moment, we have stopped signing players ‚Äì among other things because we don't have room for more. Now we have to work on departures. Benzema will have a back-up, but only for when he is ill ‚Äì not so we can bench him. For now, we have Jovic.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-real-madrid-president-psg-striker-explosive-interview/bltc49b454371e741b2,Stephen Crawford,52ce0534-4ba5-4912-8a13-f60dbacb18bd
"Aston Villa signing Coutinho permanently from Barcelona 'not as straightforward as people think', says Gerrard","Steven Gerrard has reiterated his desire to keep Philippe Coutinho at Aston Villa on a permanent basis, but has revealed that any move for the Barcelona loanee is more complex than it appears. The Blaugrana man has been a revelation since moving to Villa Park to play under former Liverpool team-mate Gerrard, and was on the scoresheet again in Thursday's 3-0 win over Leeds United. Villa have an option to sign Coutinho for a fee around ¬£33 million ($43m), but Gerrard suggested that there will be several hoops to jump through in order to make it a reality. ""I think you all know what my decision would be,"" Gerrard told Amazon Prime in his post-match comments. ""I think you all know what I think of him but this is not as straightforward as people think. ""There is obviously an option in place, Barcelona still own the player. Phil has got to obviously want to be here in terms of the big picture but he is enjoying his football and looks happy and settled. ""I know the owners are very ambitious, so we will just analyse it as we go along. But if it was totally on me and it was my cash you know what I would do."" The matter of Coutinho's future is only likely to intensify over the coming weeks as Villa look to kick on under Gerrard and secure a strong finish to the Premier League season. With Barcelona still embroiled in financial issues, a full-time move could well be on the cards, though given Coutinho's reputation in the game, there may well be other offers tabled by rivals. Villa next play European hopefuls West Ham, before they host Arsenal on March 19.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/aston-villa-signing-coutinho-permanently-barcelona-not/blt260a6f1c5d48332a,Andrew Steel,660ad67f-e53c-41a7-b5dd-c54359be4353
'Clough stepped straight out of Shakespeare' - Why 'The Damned United' was both acclaimed and controversial,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my son‚Äôs favourite film,‚Äù says David Peace, with a smile. ‚ÄúHe loves it and so do all his friends.¬† ‚ÄúBut I prefer the book!‚Äù We are talking about The Damned United, an iconic football novel which, in 2009, became an iconic football movie. A movie which may not necessarily have been to Peace‚Äôs taste, but one which would, in his own words, prove to be ‚Äúlife-changing‚Äù for the Yorkshire-born author. ‚ÄúA lot of good things came from it,‚Äù he tells GOAL. ‚ÄúIt brought loads of new fans to the book, and it opened a lot of people up to my other work. As a writer, it catapults things to a whole new level.‚Äù The book version of The Damned United was released in 2006 to widespread critical acclaim. It tells the story of Brian Clough and his ill-fated, 44-day spell as manager of Leeds United in 1974, mixing factual events and dramatised conversations in Peace‚Äôs unique, relentlessly fast-paced style.¬† ‚ÄòFaction', they called it at the time. Peace didn‚Äôt like that label one bit.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a novel,‚Äù he says now, almost 16 years on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that everything that was written was based on something that someone had said.¬† ‚ÄúNothing was made up, as such. It was just dramatised.‚Äù The critics loved it, but not everybody did. The Damned United by David Pearce. The book. Not the movie. Best novel I have read about sport,  rife with detail about 1970s football, England at that time, human self-interest and motivation pic.twitter.com/lyO3DHeUbg Clough‚Äôs family hated the way he was depicted. Johnny Giles, depicted in the book as one of the chief rebels at Leeds, claimed libel and eventually won a court battle. Peace, a Huddersfield Town fan, had written the book as ‚Äúlight relief‚Äù having achieved success with his Red Riding quartet and GB84, a searing novel set during the UK miners‚Äô strike of the mid-1980s.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always been fascinated by Clough,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe first game my dad ever took me to was Huddersfield against Brian Clough‚Äôs Leeds in Trevor Cherry‚Äôs testimonial. ‚ÄúI remember waiting outside at the old Leeds Road ground waiting for autographs. Clough ruffled my hair. A few weeks later he came back for a League Cup game. It turned out to be his last for Leeds.‚Äù Before those dark, neurotic and ultimately unfulfilling 44 days at Elland Road, Clough had turned unfashionable Derby County into league champions, and after Leeds he would go on to achieve incredible success at Nottingham Forest, winning back-to-back European Cups. He is one of English football‚Äôs most successful managers, and certainly one of its most fascinating personalities. An ideal lead character, either in print or on screen. ‚ÄúTo me, he‚Äôs something that‚Äôs stepped straight out of Shakespeare,‚Äù Peace says. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so complex and contradictory, success and fall. I think people identify with that, and also that anti-authoritarian streak in him. ‚ÄúFootball is not overburdened with characters like that now. I think early on when Jose Mourinho came to Chelsea, there were elements of Clough in the way he was, but I don‚Äôt think anyone, certainly myself included, ever solved the mystery of Brian Clough. ""That‚Äôs what makes him such an intriguing character to write books about or make films or documentaries about.‚Äù Peace admits now that, had he known how the Clough family would react to The Damned United, he probably wouldn‚Äôt have written it. ‚ÄúThe last thing I wanted to do is upset them,‚Äù he says, although he is less concerned by the reaction of someone like Giles.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen him destroy enough people on TV over the years,‚Äù he smiles. The film version was originally supposed to be directed by Stephen Frears, best known for the movies High Fidelity and Dangerous Liaisons. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd been assistant to Lindsay Anderson, who did This Sporting Life [a seminal 1963 film about an aspiring rugby league player],‚Äù says Peace. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd grown up with that kind of black-and-white, northern vibe ‚Äì Thee Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner is another ‚Äì and those were the kind of films Clough had loved, so I was thinking it‚Äôd be perfect. ‚ÄúStephen was talking about making it in black and white, making it really gritty, and I was really excited for it. And then, for various reasons, he dropped out and Tom Hooper came in.‚Äù It was Michael Sheen who was cast as Clough, with Timothy Spall as Peter Taylor, his long-time assistant. The likes of Colm Meaney [Don Revie], Stephen Graham [Billy Bremner], Martin Compston [John O‚ÄôHare] and Jim Broadbent [Sam Longson] also featured, with Peter Morgan responsible for the script. Sheen‚Äôs performance, in particular, earned stellar reviews, though there was far less of the darkness and introspection in the book. ‚ÄúThe tone is a lot lighter,‚Äù Peace says. ‚ÄúI think they were in a difficult position, because they‚Äôd seen the reaction to the book. ""They really wanted the family to like the film, and that meant a lot of the darker parts of the book were cut out.‚Äù Peace enjoyed Sheen‚Äôs portrayal ‚Äì ‚ÄúI think he really ‚Äògot‚Äô Brian‚Äù ‚Äì but he is less enthusiastic about some of the film‚Äôs key scenes, including that iconic showdown between Clough and Revie, live on television, following the former‚Äôs sacking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just wrong, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI can remember watching that at the time, and how big a thing it was. Can you imagine it now?!¬† ‚ÄúThe scene is just wrong. There was nothing to even make up; it should have written itself. ‚ÄúAnd then to make it worse, you then have the scene where [Clough] serenades Peter Taylor in his garden in Brighton like some romantic comedy!"" Despite those misgivings, Peace would soon return to the subject of football, writing Red or Dead, an epic novel about legendary former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly, in 2013. ‚ÄúThat came about because of Mike Jefferies, who produced the movie Goal!,‚Äù says Peace.¬†‚ÄúHe was keen to do a Shankly film, and contacted me.¬† ‚ÄúThe film, of course, has never been made, but that was the origin of the book.‚Äù Why hasn‚Äôt the film been made, GOAL wonders? Shankly, after all, was every bit as successful, every bit as iconic and every bit as charismatic, as Clough? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù admits Peace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really disappointing that it hasn‚Äôt. I had a go at a script, which was too dark. Mike and some other people have had a go, but it just hasn‚Äôt worked. ‚ÄúI hope that it will and I think the potential is there. Maybe the potential is more for a TV series than a film, who knows? But it‚Äôs such a rich story.‚Äù Peace lives in Tokyo these days, and is working on ‚Äúa couple‚Äù of new books, about which he is giving little away. He hopes to see Huddersfield back in the Premier League come May, and admires the work Jurgen Klopp is doing at Liverpool. Klopp, he says, would be a dream subject for any author or screenwriter. ‚ÄúHaving written Red or Dead, you kind of thought that messianic figure was gone, really,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut Shankly was that, and so is Klopp. ‚ÄúLike I say, we‚Äôve not got too many characters in the game now. Klopp is one, and I think the Mourinho/Guardiola rivalry would make a good novel or film. ""Even the way the Leeds crowd reacted to [Marcelo] Bielsa, I think that would work.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúFor me, managers are always the most interesting subjects. As much as I like books like Fever Pitch, and as much as some books about players stand out, I‚Äôve always felt the manager is the perfect subject.¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an observer as well as a participant, and he has a lot of thoughts and feelings going around. That gives you something to really go at.‚Äù Watch this space, perhaps? At some point in the future we may be seeing Klopp or Guardiola or Mourinho, or even Bielsa, portrayed on the big screen. The Damned United 2, anyone?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/clough-shakespeare-damned-united-acclaimed-controversial/bltfec6e9d6d662a0c2,Neil Jones,a6ccaf53-b3e2-436b-8c37-6ee44d1104b8
"‚ÄòI always liked Karate Kid!‚Äô - Newcastle star Saint-Maximin talks headbands, Ronaldinho inspiration & board games","Allan Saint-Maximin is a larger-than-life character at Newcastle United on and off the pitch, with the enigmatic French winger famed for his trademark headband with dreadlocks look that marks him out as being a little different to the norm. The 25-year-old revels in such a role, and always has done, with a player that has taken inspiration from some of the most mercurial playmakers of all time ‚Äì such as Ronaldinho and Zinedine Zidane ‚Äì looking to leave his own lasting impression on the game. He also keeps himself busy with creative ventures away from the football field, with his very own board game produced, and intends to continue heading down a path that allows him to ‚Äútake risks‚Äù with his image, profession of choice and business interests. A man that joined Newcastle from Nice in the summer of 2019 says that his distinctive style is inspired by a character from a famous movie from the 1980s, telling GOAL of why he wears a headband: ‚ÄúI'm not particularly trying to stand out. ‚ÄúThe headband, for example, I've always liked Karate Kid, tennis players, but also manga. In the world of manga [Japanese comics and novels], there are mythical characters who wear headbands. In tennis, [Rafa] Nadal and [Roger] Federer also wear them. Karate Kid too. ‚ÄúObviously, wearing a headband while being bald is not the best look. That's what also made me want to find a haircut that could go with my headbands.‚Äù While clinging to dreams of forcing his way into the senior France squad ahead of the 2022 World Cup, a talented forward with 12 Newcastle goals to his name from 90 appearances admits that he has always enjoyed being a flamboyant performer. ‚ÄúI was born into it,‚Äù he said when asked about his playing style and those he wanted to emulate. ‚ÄúSince I was little, whether at futsal, at five, at home between the furniture, I have always dribbled. I was going everywhere with my ball and my goal was always to dribble. ‚ÄúI've always liked Brazilian players a lot, whether it's Robinho or Ronaldinho. There are also very classy French players like Zidane. They inspired me and made me want to dribble. ‚ÄúWhen you start football at four years old and you train for 10 or 15 years to make cross passes, to work the left foot or the right foot, you inevitably manage to have qualities and to get by with the ball. But knowing how to dribble past opponents very well is not given to everyone. That's why a Zidane, in the France team, we didn't have 50 of them.‚Äù The Magpies star launched his own board game in January 2022 and continues to explore other avenues away from the football pitch, such as NFTs. His game, which is called Helios, is based on the world of Greek gods and involves a combination of risk and luck with cards, dice and coins, with its tagline being ‚ÄòFortune favours the bold‚Äô. That sums up Saint-Maximin, who has said of branching out in a direction that few of his contemporaries would have considered and whether you need to be gifted in order to tread such a path: ‚ÄúWe will say that this is a good example because it helped me to create a whole game, all the rules of this board game and everything that could be thought of around it, to also create a game that people will like, a game that stands out from the others. ‚ÄúIt took me a long time to get there and for sure having a high IQ helped me achieve my goal. ‚ÄúI'm not a big fan of board games. It was my children who made me want to create my own game, to play. That there are tournaments organised all over the world around something that I imagined, I find this beautiful.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/karate-kid-newcastle-saint-maximin-headbands-ronaldinho/blt1ba32a4711ef6f30,Elyes Khouaja,c494cf9e-e57c-4d6c-81a0-d62031675815
Aguero will be remembered as a Man City legend both on and off the field,"The likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish may have starred for Manchester City against Leeds on Tuesday evening, but there was only one name that home fans truly roared around the Etihad Stadium. Sergio Aguero. With it all-but confirmed that Aguero would announce his retirement on Wednesday, City supporters wanted to show for one last time during his playing career just how much they love their Argentine hero. The greatest goalscorer in the club's history, the greatest collection of medals of any City player, the greatest single moment in Premier League history, and, for many, simply the greatest. ""The facts speak for themselves - Sergio is quite simply the most ruthless striker in the history of the Premier League,"" City chariman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said following Aguero's confirmation that he would be hanging up his boots. ""It is extraordinary that his statistics, more reflective of two careers, are in fact those of a player whose time in the game was cut short. ""His impact lives not only in the club that we are today, but in the club that we will be for many years to come. He has earned the adoration of the City family, and the respect of the football family the world over."" Aguero's impact was incredible at the Etihad Stadium, from scoring twice on his debut as a substitute against Swansea City, to his last league appearance against Everton 10 years later, where he again scored twice off the bench. His final match for City ended in tears when they were beaten by Chelsea in the Champions League final, denying him the only medal he was missing and so desperately wanted. But his legendary status was already secured. King Kun.Everyone at Manchester City would like to take this opportunity to thank @aguerosergiokun for his incredible contribution to our success over the last decade and wish him well in his retirement üíô pic.twitter.com/AgMWXZtPZ8 A total of 260 goals is a club record by a considerable distance, while he is City's most decorated player in their history, with five Premier League titles, six Carabao Cups, one FA Cup and three Community Shields to his name. Then there was the small matter of the most dramatic and unforgettable moment in Premier League history: that 94th-minute goal against QPR on the final day of the 2011-12 campaign that delivered City's first title in 44 years while simultaneously snatching the crown away from bitter rivals Manchester United. ""He‚Äôs 33, he‚Äôs done everything in football,"" City midfielder Rodri said. ""He doesn‚Äôt need to show much more. ""For me, he‚Äôs in the top three strikers in the last 50 years. People will remember him here, of course, as a legend."" Aguero's place at the forefront of City's history is secure, and will be commemorated by a statue to go alongside Vincent Kompany and David Silva outside the Etihad Stadium. That goal against QPR was the most iconic, but there were so many other matches where he was pivotal. A crucial strike against Liverpool in the 2019 title race, Wembley goals against Chelsea and Arsenal, and a hat-trick against Bayern Munich to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 Champions League win, to name just a few. No one in Premier League history has more hat-tricks than Aguero's 12. In fact, no one born outside of England has scored more Premier League goals than his 184. Sergio Aguero has a firm place in #PL history, winning 5 titles with @ManCity and scoring 184 goalsNone more so famous than this one... pic.twitter.com/gfDdubK4ph Former City star Paul Lake, who was also forced to retire early, knows exactly what Aguero means to City fans. ""Sergio is someone close to the hearts of every City fan because of how he played, the goals that he scored, his attitude towards Manchester City, the fact that he loved the fans and obviously he scored that goal,"" Lake told GOAL. ""It's a goal that people will remember for the rest of their lives. ""But it's not just Manchester City fans, he's given the game that moment and it's the most special moment we could ever imagine, and we're so grateful for it. ""As far as City fans are concerned, he's the greatest striker we've ever had. He's going to be worshipped forever and they're probably going to need an armed bodyguard just to get him in and out again! ""That's just the love and affection that City fans have got for him, and it's richly deserved."" Aguero was the most marketable player throughout his time City, with his striking good looks enhancing his brilliance on the pitch, and City sold more shirts with his name than any other. Corporate sponsors, too, queued up to have him promoting their products. But he was adored by the people around the club, too, who will be devastated that his career has ended prematurely after a heart scare while playing for Barcelona. The Argentina internatinoal made a huge impression off the field during his 10 years in Manchester, and there were tears among those who work behind the scenes when he walked away for the final time in the summer of 2021. Funny and charming, Aguero was not always the most serious trainer, often taking to the pitches with his laces untied, while his diet was typically South American, with red meat and fizzy drinks staples as he entertained Spanish-speaking friends from City and clubs close by. Then there was the cumbia dancing and constant joking around on the training pitch, which was easy for a player like Aguero who came alive on matchday. When Pep Guardiola arrived, there was a fear that Aguero might find himself being eased out given he had not previously shown that he had the ability to lead the press, which had not been as important under Roberto Mancini or Manuel Pellegrini. Aguero, though, just got better, scoring more goals than anyone under Guardiola while playing a major role in even more success. Guardiola broke down in tears when the striker left the club, and it showed how much Aguero meant to him that he, along with City director of football, Txiki Begiristain, were in Barcelona for Aguero's emotional retirement announcement. ""He's a legend, the best striker this club has ever had for this century through the years,"" Guardiola said after Aguero's final home game. ""He is irreplaceable in the souls, in the hearts, in the minds of our fans, of our people, of the players that played alongside him and all the managers who worked with him."" The coronavirus pandemic meant there were only 10,000 people in the Etihad Stadium to say their goodbye on that day back in May.

"Ronaldo, Cavani and Rashford - Man Utd's strikers have gone missing in more ways than one","When the team news dropped at the Etihad on Sunday, there was only one question from the Manchester United fans; where is Cristiano Ronaldo? Not only was the Portugal international not in the starting XI for the Premier League derby day mauling by Man City but he wasn‚Äôt even in the country.¬† Manager Ralf Rangnick admitted that he did not know the 37-year-old had left the UK on his private jet ahead of the game but refused to criticise the forward for his decision with the German manager saying he had ‚Äòno issue‚Äô with his actions.¬† It is not the first time Ronaldo has jetted off when not needed. Club sources said in January that players were free to do what they wished in their down time and on both occasions when the Portugal captain has taken a quick break in his home country he has returned to training as expected.¬† Rangnick‚Äôs explanation - that Ronaldo was carrying an injury - appeared to be refuted by the player‚Äôs sister on social media as she suggested he was in fact just dropped.  The decision to play with a false 9 meant Ronaldo would be only be used as a substitute and by the end of Friday‚Äôs training session he had reported to the club doctor with an injury.¬† Whatever Ronaldo does, there will always be a circus around his actions and decisions. He returned to a fanfare but the last few months have been a disappointment and the derby snub was just another example.¬† His goals have dried up, with just one league goal this year, and he cuts a frustrated figure on the pitch; throwing his arms in the air, kicking goal posts and remonstrating to referees.¬† When he agreed to return in August it was not with the idea of fighting for fourth spot. He hoped he would be coming back to win trophies.  It is therefore hardly surprising that he has yet to make a decision on his long-term future at Old Trafford.¬† It is understood if United fail to get that coveted Champions League spot then he would look to leave; even at 37, the Europa League is beneath him.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a strange situation that he finds himself in back at Manchester United,‚Äù former United striker Teddy Sheringham told GOAL.  ‚ÄúIt must be very, very different from when Sir Alex was there and running everything ‚Äì everything was a tight ship all sailing together. It seems like there are lots of fragments at Manchester United all going their own ways and there is no leadership anywhere.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not ideal for Ronaldo to come back into that. I would think that if it carries on like this until the end of the season and he has a chance to go somewhere else, I think that could probably happen.‚Äù One of the issues for both Rangnick and Ronaldo is that at the beginning of the season this was not what the club had planned. Mason Greenwood, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Edinson Cavani and Ronaldo meant Rangnick had plenty of options up front.¬† But various circumstances meant United started the derby without a centre-forward in the starting XI or on the bench.¬† Ronaldo‚Äôs absence will always be noted no matter what the reason but Rangnick would not have had to rely on him so heavily had Cavani been fit.  The Uruguayan decides when he is fit enough to play and the derby was the 17th Premier League game he has missed this season.¬† Rangnick said in his Friday afternoon press conference that Cavani should be available for the Saturday evening visit of Tottenham Hotspur. But, with another training session to complete before that, anything is possible.¬† Then there is the current issue with Rashford which also complicates Rangnick‚Äôs strikeforce plans. The England international has been struggling for form and is low on confidence which has affected his displays.¬† The interim manager is impressed with Rashford in training but wants to him replicate that form on the pitch, something he has not been capable of in recent weeks.¬† United have 10 games to salvage a fourth-place finish and if they‚Äôre going to manage it they not only need a helping hand from their rivals but a revival from a strikeforce whose main stars have gone missing... in more ways than one.

"Chelsea's Rudiger could transfer to Man Utd, Barcelona, Real Madrid or Juventus as ownership situation drags on","Uncertainty around Chelsea‚Äôs ownership could lead to Antonio Rudiger joining fierce rivals Manchester United or another major club such as Barcelona, Real Madrid or Juventus. The four footballing superpowers are ready to offer the 29-year-old a lucrative contract after extension negotiations ground to a halt due to sanctions on Roman Abramovich and ongoing talks to sell the club. The Blues defender was close to signing a renewal that would have made him the club‚Äôs highest-paid defender, but negotiations may have to be picked up from scratch by one of the four American-led consortiums currently in the process of trying to buy the Stamford Bridge side. With Abramovich having been sanctioned due to his ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, the invasion of Ukraine has led to the businessman having to sell the club. Chelsea are working closely with the UK government to facilitate a sale, but the uncertainty caused by the situation has plunged Rudiger's future into doubt. Had the club bowed to the German's renewal demands earlier there would be no cause for concern, but director Marina Granovskaia's tough negotiating approach has seen talks drag on for some time. In addition, the deadline for final bids from those interested in buying the club has been pushed back to April 14, which has caused further delays. Those bids will then be assessed in painstaking detail in line with the Premier League‚Äôs due diligence process. As frustrating as it is for fans, the process has actually moved at an unprecedented pace due to the potential sporting issues and devaluing of the club that would happen should the takeover - worth over ¬£2.5 billion ($3.3bn) - rumble on. Most of the other issues have been resolved by adjustments to the club‚Äôs licence, including allowing supporters into matches. Indeed, The Blues are losing around ¬£30 million ($40m) a month, but Abramovich can now put in money through his parent company, Fordstam Ltd, to cover the shortfall. The Blues continue to scout for players that they could try to sign in the summer, with a marquee signing likely to be sanctioned by any new owner. Sevilla‚Äôs Jules Kounde was a leading central defender target, with midfielders Declan Rice and Aurelien Tchouameni also on the agenda. They‚Äôre also looking at youth players to bolster their academy teams, which have struggled this season. In terms of outgoings, Andreas Christensen looks set to depart Barcelona on a free transfer for issues unrelated to the ownership.  The Catalan giants are also keen to sign Cesar Azpilicueta, although an appearance clause that was first revealed by GOAL has extended his contract for another season. Elsewhere, Dortmund are interested in signing Timo Werner, who could push for a move away in the summer. Tuchel has also called on the club to not allow a repeat of the situation around expiring contracts for defenders to happen next season, with N‚ÄôGolo Kante and Jorginho having just over a year left on their respective deals.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-s-rudiger-could-transfer-to-man-utd-barcelona-real/blt6014f57bbd2fe38a,Nizaar Kinsella,ff62d45e-7173-485f-9496-ae6ef45e3d3e
"Fury vs Whyte predictions: Rice, Alexander-Arnold & footballers pick their winners in the heavyweight title fight","Tyson Fury has returned to the United Kingdom to defend his heavyweight belts against Dillian Whyte, in what he says will be his last ever boxing match. Naturally, a fight of this magnitude has sparked a lot of discussion, and plenty of footballers have had their say, including Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, England international Declan Rice, and Aston Villa bossSteven Gerrard.  So which fighter are the footballers backing? GOAL takes a look. Former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, was particularly confident of the current champion, backing Fury to win. ""Fury for me is someone who we should just enjoy, to be alive at the same time, to be able to watch him,"" said the Liverpudlian. ""I think it will be comfortable, but he‚Äôll probably do it after six (rounds) at some point."" Current Reds star Trent Alexander-Arnold agreed but believes it won‚Äôt be so straightforward, saying: ""I like both fighters to be honest. I always back Fury in fights, I think he‚Äôs got what it takes. Dillian‚Äôs got a lot of heart, I think it‚Äôll be a real scrap. Who knows? It‚Äôs heavyweight boxing, anything can happen.""  Fury appears to be the overwhelming favourite among football stars, with Rio Ferdinand, Peter Crouch, and Joe Cole all expressing their faith in the current heavyweight champion. Ferdinand says that ""Whyte can cause some problems"", but ultimately believes that Fury‚Äôs experience will give him the upper hand. Crouch predicted an eighth-round stoppage in favour of Fury, while Cole believes the fight will go the full 12 rounds before Fury gets the unanimous decision in his favour.  West Ham captain Declan Rice on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt so sure, saying: ""I have to sit on the fence, I can‚Äôt call it.  ""It‚Äôs hard because (with) Dillian Whyte, you never know what you‚Äôre going to get, he‚Äôs got an absolute bomb on him. But Fury is just so good, technically unbelievable.  ""I think Whyte‚Äôs gonna have to knock him out if he wants to win, I think if it goes to points, Fury will outbox him."" Watch the full predictions below. The fight between Fury and Whyte will take place on Saturday, April 23, 2022 at Wembley Stadium in London.  The undercards will start at 6pm BST (1pm ET), with ring walks for the main event scheduled for 10pm BST (5pm ET). These times are subject to change depending on the length of the undercard bouts, as is always the case. In the UK, Fury vs Whyte will be broadcast live on Saturday night on BT Sport Box Office. The pay-per-view will cost fans ¬£24.95.

USMNT star Pefok moves to Bundesliga with Union Berlin,"U.S. men's national team striker Jordan Pefok has completed a transfer to Union Berlin, the Bundesliga club confirmed on Thursday.  The 26-year-old striker arrives from Swiss club Young Boys, where he enjoyed a fine 2021-22 which included five Champions League goals as he finished as the club's leading scorer. The Washington, D.C.-born No. 9 previously played in France, representing Reims and Rennes before his move to Switzerland.  ""1. FC Union Berlin have completed the signing of striker Jordan Siebatcheu,"" the club confirmed on its official website. ""The 26-year-old U.S. international has made the switch to Kopenick from Swiss side Young Boys."" The player added: ‚ÄúAfter two successful years in Bern, where I had the perfect environment to develop as a young player, the next step in my career is now ahead of me.  ""I want to prove myself in the Bundesliga and I‚Äôm sure that I have found the right club in Union.  ""Their style of play suits me well and I‚Äôm looking forward to scoring for the Eisernen in the incredible atmosphere at the Alte Forsterei."" GOAL's¬†United States Correspondent Ryan Tolmich¬†writes... ""Pefok faces an uphill battle to get back into contention to be the USMNT's No. 9, but this is exactly the type of move that makes that hill a bit easier to climb. ""If the 26-year-old striker can start the season on a tear, he'll certainly jump right back onto Gregg Berhalter's radar to be in the squad for Qatar later this year. ""As things stand, Jesus Ferreira is probably the favorite to start at striker, with the likes of Ricardo Pepi, Josh Sargent, Haji Wright and Daryl Dike all in the mix, but that race will almost certainly come down to whichever player is in the best form come the fall. ""At Union Berlin, Pefok is now at a level that would make a surge of goals impossible to look past. ""The club finished fifth last season, so the talent will be there around him, so the ball is now in Pefok's court to play his way back into the squad.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-star-pefok-moves-to-bundesliga-with-union-berlin/blt79872b49b7d48210,Daniel Edwards,662ac629-0841-42fc-8277-40afede06b43
Chaotic Chelsea-Liverpool draw shows why Man City will surely be Premier League champions,"James Milner grimaced like a man who knew what he had done, and what might follow. Maybe he did. There were three minutes until half-time at Stamford Bridge and Liverpool were in the ascendency, 2-0 up and looking set to blast their way back into the Premier League title race. Sadio Mane had ended his nine-game goal drought and Mohamed Salah had delivered another magical moment to usher in the new year. West London began the day blue, but it was swiftly turning red. And then, with one careless foul, the whole thing changed. A cheap free-kick and a Mateo Kovacic screamer later, Chelsea had a lifeline where there appeared to be none. Milner looked to the heavens, his team-mates just looked annoyed. The start of Chelsea's fightback...üí™Kovacic got their first goal of the match with an absolute stunner! üöÄ pic.twitter.com/EvhnFEnTHF Kovacic with a stunning volley for @ChelseaFC!üì∫ @USA_Network | #CHELIV pic.twitter.com/dBRRCh6xIw By half-time, Liverpool‚Äôs lead was gone, and by full-time, surely, so were their chances of catching Manchester City. We can probably write Chelsea off as well, as it happens. This game, wild, unpredictable and about as intense as it gets, may have shown why these two sides are so far ahead of the other 17 in the league, but the truth of the matter is that it also showed why neither of them are likely to get near Pep Guardiola‚Äôs reigning champions. It finished 2-2, a result to be celebrated only at the Etihad Stadium. City‚Äôs gap is 10 points to Chelsea and 11 to Liverpool, who boast a game in hand but will now be without both Salah and Mane for the remainder of January. On this evidence, they will struggle to cope. There were mitigating circumstances - injuries, suspensions, Covid cases and the absence of their manager, Jurgen Klopp, for example - but the Reds will rue their own carelessness, for sure. This was another game they could and should have won. This was their sixth draw of the campaign, and in five of them they have led. Two years ago, they were relentless, a team capable of shutting down games with almost robotic ease, but since clinching that elusive Premier League title in 2020, that ruthless streak has deserted them. And it is that which will cost them this season. They had looked good when Mane profited from a Trevoh Chalobah error to open the scoring after just nine minutes. It was the Senegal star‚Äôs first goal in more than 800 minutes, and taken with aplomb. Chelsea had started in lively fashion, but by 26 minutes they were on the ropes, Trent Alexander-Arnold picking out the run of Salah, who skinned Marcos Alonso and clipped the ball past Edouard Mendy at the near post. After drawing a blank in his last two league matches, the Egyptian was never going to make it a hat-trick, was he? The best in the world...üåçMohamed Salah does it again as #LFC extend their lead against Chelsea! üî¥ pic.twitter.com/mbuKlRoxpj MO. SALAH.üì∫ @USA_Network | #CHELIV pic.twitter.com/D0Z4VPjCwj But even when leading, Liverpool never gave the air of a side in control. They were open and frenetic, their pass completion in the opening 45 minutes was their lowest of the season, and as a result they left the door ajar for Chelsea. Milner‚Äôs mistake and Kovacic‚Äôs stunner changed everything. It was manic, the game driven along by a raucous Stamford Bridge atmosphere. Christian Pulisic levelled and from there it was anyone‚Äôs game. Liverpool had the better efforts in the second half, Mendy saving well from both Salah and Mane, while Chelsea bossed possession and probed with patience. Neither could find the killer blow, though, and in the end the draw was the right result. Especially for Manchester City. Guardiola can start ordering the silver polish and the open-top bus now, surely?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-liverpool-draw-man-city-premier-league-champions/blt0a90338db1cf4fe2,Neil Jones,7a24ea6e-01a7-4861-a4d0-941eb82569d7
Grealish shows why Guardiola has no doubts that ¬£100m man belongs in Man City's ruthless machine,"This was the Jack Grealish that Manchester City have been waiting for.  Socks rolled down, the ball at his feet, gliding through challenges and opening up defences, Grealish put in his most dazzling display since he made his British-record transfer was completed against Leeds United, illustrating exactly why Pep Guardiola was convinced to play ¬£100 million ($135m) for him.  Leeds, whose injury problems were no excuse for their abysmal performance or the eventual 7-0 scoreline, allowed City to enjoy themselves, and no one more so than Grealish.  The 26-year-old looked like he was back having fun, trusting his natural ability to drift past players and demanding the ball in a bid to change the game.  There has been a feeling at City that Grealish has been unable to shake off his awe of his new City team-mates, as while he has been effective and hard-working in the champions' climb back to the top of the Premier League table, he has not delivering the moments of magic that made him a match-winner at Aston Villa.  He was, for example, overflowing in his praise for Kevin De Bruyne long before he was even a transfer target for Guardiola, while he recently said that it is ‚Äúa joke‚Äù how technically good Joao Cancelo is.  Throw in the brilliance of players like Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez, and it perhaps should not be surprising that even someone as confident as Grealish would start doubting their own ability.  Crucially, Guardiola has never doubted his new attacking star, and spoke ahead of the Leeds game about how  sure he was that Grealish would eventually come good. ""He has to do exactly what he is doing, no more than that. The rest will come,"" the Catalan said at his pre-match press conference. ""He has chances to score two or three goals every game, and one day he is going to do it. He could have had a hat-trick against Watford and in the last game one or two goals again. ""Never in my career did I find one season when every player stays, from the beginning to the end, in top form. There are highs and lows. ""But he doesn't have to score. What he has to do is play like he knows what to do, feel that his contribution is helping to win games and the rest will come."" Fortunately for Grealish, Guardiola and City, the England international did find the net on Tuesday for what was his first league goal since August, albeit not via the method most have come to expect from the playmaker. His bullet header from Riyad Mahrez's 13th-minute cross marked the first time that Grealish has scored a headed goal in the Premier League, though he had already given notice of his intent in a more expected manner just seconds before as he cut inside past two players before hitting a low shot that was palmed away by Illan Meslier.  A minute later, he exchanged passes with De Bruyne and was a last-ditch scramble away from running in behind the Leeds defence.  By the time he got his goal, City were already ahead through Phil Foden, and by the full-time whistle Leeds had capitulated to their heaviest ever Premier League defeat, and joint-worst competitive loss in their history.  It was a devastating team performance from City, and Grealish was no longer on the fringes, but instead found himself directing proceedings.  He has acclimatised to the Guardiola philosophy quicker than most, knowing when and which passes to make, the right places to move with the ball, how to press and when to drop and help out the defence.  The only thing that has been missing are some of those quicksilver moments that made him so irresistible to City in the summer. The hope is that the floodgates will open in that regard now he has broken his goalscoring drought. It helped that Leeds were so open in trying to stop City in what was a rather unusual sight at the Etihad Stadium. Recent home games against lower mid-table teams like Wolves, Crystal Palace and Southampton have been a battle against well-drilled defensive sides, determined to keep City out.  Guardiola has in turn tried to stretch opponents to create more space, leaving Grealish tight to the left flank and playing more like a traditional winger than a floating inside forward.  That does not mean he cannot impact games, but being further away from goal has made it harder for him to get those key goal and assist stats that he will judged upon come the end of the campaign. Those goal stats improved against Leeds and should get the critics off his back for a few days, but it was his role in such a mesmerising performance will help Grealish himself believe that he really belongs on this stage.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/grealish-guardiola-no-doubts-100m-man-belongs-man-city/blt88dc1ac60c1ecfda,Jonathan Smith,1e214514-cf46-44b1-9993-7be72a005034

With Liverpool up next for the Dutchman, he faces the very realistic prospect of being pointless after three games in charge.  First-half goals from Josh Dasilva, Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee and Bryan Mbeumo stunned United's star-studded side and left the home fans in raptures.

So far to go: Arsenal‚Äôs need for transfers laid bare by Liverpool defeat,"If ever there was an example that Arsenal needed to get some new additions in, this was it. The Gunners started the day with hopes of Wembley, but ended it by seeing their Carabao Cup dreams dashed following a 2-0 defeat by Liverpool in their semi-final second leg. Mikel Arteta‚Äôs side¬†have now crashed out of both domestic cup competitions in the space of two weeks - with a decimated squad unable to cope with a number of injuries, Covid cases and international absences The likes of Takehiro Tomiyasu, Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard all started against Liverpool on Thursday night, but they looked like a group of players who had barely been able to train for the past week. From the moment Diego Jota gave Liverpool the lead on 19 minutes, they never really looked like surrendering their advantage. Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side just had too much experience and know-how, with Arsenal struggling to build any sort of momentum on a frustrating night at Emirates Stadium. It was another disappointing defeat for Arteta‚Äôs side on the back of the horrible FA Cup exit at Nottingham Forest and the Arsenal boss must now ensure a season that has promised so much, doesn‚Äôt start to slip away. There are now 11 days left of the transfer window and it feels imperative that the Gunners bolster their squad before January 31. They have spent the past three weeks getting players out, with Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Folarin Balogun, Pablo Mari and Sead Kolasinac all leaving the club, but now the focus must be on bringing people in. Arsenal started last summer with a bloated squad, now it looks the exact opposite and the past couple of weeks have shown exactly that. The Gunners just haven‚Äôt been able to cope with the injuries that have come their way and have understandably started to look a bit flat. Things will improve in the coming weeks, with Thomas Partey having already arrived back from Afcon and Mohamed Elneny and Nicolas Pepe following soon. Granit Xhaka will also soon return from suspension, but they still need more, especially with serious doubts hanging over the future of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The fact that they had to include Partey on the bench against Liverpool, just 48 hours after Ghana had been knocked out of Afcon, highlighted just how stretched things are. With Arsenal 1-0 down, Arteta threw the midfielder on for the closing 20 minutes even though he‚Äôd only arrived back in England earlier in the day. It was a risk and one that didn‚Äôt pay off, with Partey picking up two bookings and getting himself sent off. He will now join Xhaka in missing the Burnley game on Sunday through suspension, further adding to Arteta‚Äôs woes. The red card completed a miserable night for the hosts, with Liverpool just too well drilled. Arsenal started well and hit the bar through an Alexandre Lacazette‚Äôs free-kick, but once Jota‚Äôs miscued shot decided Ramsdale on 19 minutes, the home side had little answer. Gabriel Martinelli was the one player who caused Liverpool problems and Odegaard looked bright, but both he and Smith Rowe often found themselves far too deep because of the 4-3-3 formation Arteta was forced to use because of a lack of midfielders. Lacazette did have one good chance after the interval after being picked out by Albert Lokonga, but he couldn‚Äôt keep his effort down. Jota eventually killed the tie off with his and Liverpool‚Äôs second, lifting an excellent finish over Ramsdale after being picked out by a fabulous Trent Alexander-Arnold pass. Arsenal went into the tie with expectations high after their battling 0-0 draw at Anfield in the first leg last week, but in the end they were given another example of the gap that still exists between them and the Premier league‚Äôs top sides. The key thing now is to brush off the disappointment and focus back on the Premier League. They have put themselves in an excellent position when it comes to securing a top-four finish, but they now need to try and get the job done. To do that, you feel that new additions are vital before the end of the month. Talks with Juventus over a deal for Arthur are continuing and Arsenal are hopeful of completing a loan deal for the midfielder before the window closes. His arrival would be a welcome boost, but a striker feels essential as well - especially if Aubameyang does end up leaving amid mounting interest in the former captain. The fact Arsenal had Eddie Nketiah leading the line for the final 20 minutes against Liverpool as they searched for a way back into the tie summed things up. This was a day that started full of promise for the Gunners but they came up short. They need to get some good business done in the next 11 days to ensure the rest of the season doesn‚Äôt follow suit.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/so-far-to-go-arsenal-s-need-for-transfers-laid-bare-by-liverpool-/blta4f2de6b09d82b37,Charles Watts,4e1f6725-8e40-47e3-a3b8-8308618d83ec
"Zirkzee reveals he received 'hateful, racist' messages after 'stupid' miss in Bayern's pre-season friendly vs Ajax","Joshua Zirkzee has revealed that he received ‚Äúhateful, racist‚Äù messages on the back of a ‚Äústupid‚Äù miss for Bayern Munich in a pre-season outing against Ajax, but a man impressing on loan at Anderlecht has vowed not to change his ways and to fight for a long-term future with the Bundesliga champions. The 20-year-old Dutch forward attracted criticism in July 2021 when spurning a chance in a friendly contest with Eredivisie giants Ajax that saw him round the goalkeeper but dwell on the ball too long ‚Äì allowing a defender to slide in and clear from inches out. Zirkzee briefly wiped his Instagram account on the back of that summer fixture, with online abuse aimed in his direction, but he soon shrugged the incident off and considers the matter to be closed. Zirkzee told GOAL and SPOX of clearing his social media: ‚ÄúIt wasn't a big deal for me. I turned off the messaging function on Instagram. ‚ÄúI was completely inactive on Instagram for two or three days, then I went back online. It was a bit too much for me and I needed a break. I got hateful, racist, stupid messages.‚Äù Still cannot believe Zirkzee didn't score this ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èpic.twitter.com/wjZD27Vkaw He added on the furore surrounding his miss against Ajax: ‚ÄúPersonally, I couldn't have cared less about the criticism. ‚ÄúI missed a chance, but on the whole I played a decent game. I actually had a good pre-season in Munich. ‚ÄúOf course it was stupid that I missed this chance. Many people hyped it up afterwards, but I didn't care. I was in good form and wanted to continue it. ‚ÄúAt that moment I should have been more professional. It shouldn't have happened to me, but it happened: So what?‚Äù As many took aim at Zirkzee on the back of his outing against Ajax, questions were also asked of whether he was displaying the right attitude in training and doing enough to convince Bayern of his worth. He has responded to those claims by saying: ‚ÄúI had a difficult period. It's difficult to show yourself when you're not really a part of the team. ‚ÄúDid I give less than 100 per cent in training? No. Did I go home a bit more sad than normal? For sure. ‚ÄúI was hoping to play more. Then within a short period of time I played less. It was difficult. ‚ÄúPeople get that impression of me more often at times like this. The important thing for me is what the coach says. And Hansi Flick never said anything to me. ‚ÄúI am who I am. Either people accept it or they don't. And if they don't, I don't care.‚Äù Shortly after his polarising performance in a meeting with Ajax, Zirkzee was freed by Bayern to take in a season-long loan at Anderlecht. He has enjoyed a productive campaign in Belgium, netting 14 goals, and the Netherlands U21 international believes he can still make an impression alongside Robert Lewandowski and Co at the Allianz Arena. Zirkzee said on his future: ‚ÄúI still hope I can become an important player for Bayern some day. ‚ÄúI will return to Bayern this summer. Where I will be after that depends on the prospects of playing regularly, because that is the most important thing for me.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zirkzee-received-hateful-racist-messages-stupid-miss-bayern/blt08ca7a3659a7500e,Nino Duit,b01c90df-8c81-4acc-ad1e-2dafd9813066

Man City loanee Ko Itakura open to Schalke stay as he hails 'incredible' Arsenal full-back Tomiyasu,"Manchester City defender Ko Itakura has told GOAL that he can see himself staying at Schalke after his loan deal with the club ends in the summer. The German side have a ¬£5 million ($6.5m) option to make the move for the Japan international permanent at the end of the 2021-22 campaign. Itakura joined City in 2019 but has never played for the Premier League champions having been immediately sent out on a two-year loan to Dutch side FC Groningen before moving to 2. Bundesliga club Schalke.  ‚ÄúOf course, I can imagine staying here, Schalke is a big club with a long history and great supporters,‚Äù Itakura told GOAL on behalf of¬†Betway.  ‚ÄúPlaying in front of a breathtaking crowd is what every player is dreaming of and the club has enormous potential.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing next season will be recommending myself for the World Cup by performing well at the club. My long-term goal is to play first division football ‚Äì and I‚Äôd love to achieve that with Schalke this season.‚Äù  The 25-year-old has adapted quickly and has started all but the opening game of the season for Schalke and has four goals from centre-back.  But any move could depend on whether the club can gain promotion, with Schalke currently top of the second tier but with fourth-placed Darmstadt just five points behind.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad that I was able to settle in quickly and that I‚Äôve played so many games so far and been able to take responsibility,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSchalke is definitely a club that belongs in the Bundesliga but the race for the promotion spots is tough.‚Äù  Itakura is one of a number of European-based footballers hoping to be part of Japan‚Äôs World Cup squad later in the year.  And he hailed Arsenal full-back Takehiro Tomiyasu as an inspiration for players aiming to get to the very top.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible how he‚Äôs developed recently, especially at a big club like Arsenal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a very talented player and one of the examples that show Japanese players who come to Europe can develop and make it to the highest level.‚Äù  Japan have been drawn with European powerhouses Germany and Spain for Qatar 2022, along with the winners of the play-off between Costa Rica and New Zealand.  Despite being outsiders to make it out of the group stage, Itakura says they have the potential to cause a surprise.  ‚ÄúReaching the group stage is already great, but we want more now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have a very tough group and of course we are the underdogs. Although many people say that we have no chance, I don‚Äôt think that the bigger teams will underestimate us.‚Äù ",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-loanee-itakura-schalke-stay-incredible-arsenal-full/bltb0a5421e2de242af,Jonathan Smith,e79f402e-06d3-4c1b-b0fe-585c73fbffd2
'England isn't a mystical foreign land' - USMNT goalkeeper Turner feels ready for Arsenal move,"USMNT goalkeeper Matt Turner says he is ""excited"" to make the move to Arsenal ahead of his expected transfer, with the shotstopper admitting he is looking forward to not thinking of the Premier League as some sort of ""mystical foreign land"". The outgoing New England Revolution star agreed a deal to head to the Emirates Stadium at the start of 2022, with the 27-year-old rewarded with a switch to Europe after his fine form both for club and country over the past few seasons. With the knowledge of his switch however, Turner has had to play the waiting game to get over to North London - and with his final medical now looming, he admits that it feels ""surreal"" to be making the switch to one of England's most storied clubs.  ""I'm feeling good,"" the Stars and Stripes international stated on his move. ""I'm feeling extremely excited, grateful obviously for this opportunity to play for such a historic club with an amazing fan base. ""It‚Äôs surreal so I'm looking forward to getting my boots on the ground in the UK and getting to work, not thinking of it as this like mystical foreign land and just really going over there and putting the work in because that's what I do best. I'm going to go there and I'm going to work really, really hard.  ""My goalkeeper coach here is from London, his family is still over there. I have people that I can rely on, people that can hold me accountable and get together to destress a little bit. I know that I'll have people that I can rely on over there so I'm not really concerned in that matter.‚Äù Much like Zack Steffen at Manchester City, Turner appears to be arriving at the Emirates Stadium to fulfil a role already held by an undisputed first choice, in the shape of Aaron Ramsdale. That would suggest a second fiddle position to the England international, who endured a tough Nations League campaign amid a fatigued, experimental Three Lions line-up ahead of Qatar 2022. But with Turner needing to challenge for his own World Cup spot, he will be keen to ensure he is more than just a potential cup goalkeeper - and could well provide Mikel Arteta with a few headaches if his warning to his soon-to-be team-mate over not merely collecting cheques turns out to be true.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-goalkeeper-turner-excited-for-arsenal-transfer/blt169ec624d1d4a9dc,Andrew Steel,90601b29-819e-4061-b1c8-3168e41d4532
The numbers typifying Salah‚Äôs Premier League drought,"Liverpool do battle with Manchester United on Tuesday night knowing full well a victory sends them top of the Premier League, for 24 hours at least, until Manchester City‚Äôs encounter with giant-killing Brighton & Hove Albion. Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs troops are favourites to extend their 19-point lead over the visitors from Manchester with the chasm in the league table tipped to show at Anfield. The antecedent in this fixture favours the Reds who have claimed three victories and played out a goalless encounter in the last four meetings between the clubs, with the Merseyside outfit outscoring the Red Devils 11-2. Mohamed Salah has netted five of the Anfield outfit's goals, accounting for 45 percent of Liverpool‚Äôs goals against United. This includes a stunning Old Trafford hat-trick in the reverse fixture in which Klopp‚Äôs men annihilated the hosts 5-0. That treble saw the Egypt superstar become the first visiting player since Ronaldo (with Real Madrid in 2003) to hit three goals at the Theatre of Dreams and only the second player in Liverpool‚Äôs history to achieve the feat. In normal circumstances, the league‚Äôs top scorer ought to be looking forward to Tuesday‚Äôs game against Ralph Rangnick‚Äôs Jekyll and Hyde side who have conceded 10 times in their last five. However, a goalscoring drop-off has left many observers wondering what has happened to the walking talking scoring statistic from the first half of the campaign. The 29-year-old has not scored from open play in exactly two months since Alisson Becker‚Äôs brilliant assist saw the Egyptian edge his side ahead of Norwich City, a game Liverpool won 3-1. While the league‚Äôs top scorer has netted three times since that strike in February, all have been from the spot as the ex-Chelsea man's struggles concern fans and observers. In recent scoreless encounters against Arsenal, Watford and City, Salah has failed to hit any of his shots on target despite seven attempts per Fbref. Interestingly, a closer look at those efforts show these have not been high-quality chances, with respective Expected Goals of 0.2, 0.1 and 0 against the aforementioned opponents. Contrast this with the previous three games against Leeds United, West Ham United and Brighton where the frontman‚Äôs non-penalty xG was 0.8, 0.8 and 0.6 respectively. This highlights a decrease in clear-cut openings for the forward whose low-percentage efforts have understandably not produced the desired results in the final third. The fact Salah has been involved in four shot-creating actions altogether in this ongoing spell indicates a broader lack of involvement for a player who totalled 15 SCAs in the three games hitherto. Unsurprisingly, observers have put this down to perhaps mental fatigue from twice losing out to Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations final and the World Cup playoffs, the wide attacker is not alien to these sorts of droughts.  Salah‚Äôs one goal in nine run in 2018/19 included a six-match run without finding the back of the net, there was a three-game and four-game spell without scoring the following season, while last term saw the Liverpool forward endure two extended spells without finding the back of the net ‚Äî a six-game run from late December to late January and a five-match spell from mid-February to mid-March. The aforementioned dearth of goals did not prevent the Egypt international from scoring bucketloads of goals, so this current run, while drawing loads of attention, pales in comparison to droughts in preceding campaigns. Indeed, Liverpool‚Äôs array of match winners means Klopp is unlikely to be burned by his top forward‚Äôs ongoing run. Having said that, the Reds need him back on the scoring trail sooner rather than later as the season‚Äôs denouement approaches and they compete on multiple fronts at home and in Europe.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/the-numbers-typifying-salah-s-premier-league-drought/blt4a3017d3ab04655f,Seye Omidiora,d1744041-b391-4a7b-bf05-a7edc5b45741
"Arsenal's Tierney 'the best overlapping centre-back in the world', says Scotland boss Clarke","Scotland manager Steve Clarke has explained how he convinced Arsenal's Kieran Tierney to convert from a left-back to a centre-back for the benefit of his country. Tierney almost exclusively plays in the left side of the defence for his club but reinvented himself for the sake of the Tartan Army. The defender has 29 international caps to his name and it's likely he wouldn't have as many if it weren't for his versatility. Clarke said on the High Performance Podcast: ‚ÄúBetween November and March I was thinking about what we were good at. Defensively we weren‚Äôt great and needed a change. ""I phoned my coaches and said ‚Äòwe can‚Äôt go with a back four, I want to go with a back three‚Äô. I had never coached a back three in my life so it was a challenge for me and my coaches. ‚ÄúThe personnel we had ‚Äì we had two of the best left-backs in world football, Tierney and Robertson, and had to figure out how to get them in the team.  ""At that moment I didn‚Äôt think the centre-back options were great, so let‚Äôs pick three and see if that makes it better! ‚ÄúMy idea was that Tierney could play centre-back and I had this mad idea that Scott McTominay could play as one of the others.  ""I had good midfield players and I wanted to get three or four into the team but had nothing great up front really. ‚ÄúI had a really good conversation with Tierney to tell him he was going to be the best left-sided centre-back that Scotland had ever had."" Clarke added: ""A myth had built up around Kieran that he didn‚Äôt want to come and play with the national team, which wasn‚Äôt correct.  ""But I think he always felt that he was a better left-back than Andy Robertson. Every player thinks they‚Äôre better than the immediate competition and if you compare them, there isn‚Äôt a cigarette paper between them. ‚ÄúI had to persuade Kieran that he was better than Andy and that‚Äôs why I trusted him to play left centre-back and not Andy. Now, that‚Äôs probably not strictly true but that‚Äôs how I had to sell it to Kieran. ""Now we‚Äôve got the best overlapping centre-back in world football. It works. ‚ÄúSelling that position to Kieran was important and it was a really good conversation, he asked a lot of really good questions. ""I told him I loved him and I wanted him to play there."" Tierney's made 20 appearances across all competitions for the Gunners, netting a single effort while grabbing three assists. The Scotsman's ankle injury back in November saw him temporarily miss matches before having to sit on the bench until early December. Once Tierney proved his fitness again, he hasn't missed a fixture since, regaining Mikel Arteta's confidence in him.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-tierney-best-overlapping-centre-back-in-the-world/bltd8eaafd9d8fbe86e,Marwan Harraz,a76596cf-8673-4404-8b74-11fb349ed91d

Liverpool complete deadline day Arthur Melo loan signing from Juventus,"WHAT HAPPENED? The Reds launched a surprise deadline day move for the Brazilian international after captain Jordan Henderson became the latest midfielder sidelined through injury. The 26-year-old, set to wear No. 29, completed a medical on Merseyside on Thursday afternoon and will now spend the season at Anfield. Juventus say there is an option for Liverpool to make the move permanent for a fee of ‚Ç¨37.5million (¬£32m/$37m). THE BIGGER PICTURE: Liverpool have been struck by a spate of midfield injuries, with Henderson, who is expected to miss at least two weeks, joining the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the sidelines.  AND WHAT'S MORE: The Reds tried to launch a late bid for RB Leipzig's Konrad Laimer, but found the Bundesliga side unwilling to do business for the Austrian international, who is expected to join Bayern Munich when his contract expires in 2023. STORY IN THREE PHOTOS:  Arthur started his career at Gremio... He joined Barcelona in 2018... Before moving on to Juventus in 2020... DID YOU KNOW? Arthur was part of the Barcelona team beaten 4-0 by Liverpool at Anfield in the second-leg of the 2018-19 Champions League semi-final. He replaced Arturo Vidal for the final 15 minutes, arriving shortly before Divock Origi's iconic winning goal. THE VERDICT: Liverpool fans have been crying out for a new midfield signing all summer, but few would have predicted that it would be Arthur who would be identified as the solution to their problems. He at least arrives with pedigree, having played for Barcelona and Juventus as well as the Brazilian national team, but his recent form and injury record offers cause for concern. The suspicion is that Liverpool have taken a low-risk, low-cost move with a bigger picture in mind. WHAT NEXT FOR ARTHUR AND LIVERPOOL? Arthur is expected to be eligible for the Reds' Premier League trip to Everton on Saturday afternoon, though given the fact he has not played a competitive game since May, he is unlikely to start at Goodison Park.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-complete-deadline-day-arthur-melo-loan-signing/bltd516ec1f58ed8505,Neil Jones,06508283-4ddb-47a0-bf14-40a2624e3bda
'Silly question!' - Prickly Klopp clashes with journalist that dares to mention Liverpool's 'slow start',"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was left frustrated in his pre-Crystal Palace press conference after being asked how to combat his team's ""slow start"" against Fulham. A far from ideal opening day performance from Liverpool left Klopp frustrated at full-time, leading him to question his team's attitude. Promoted Fulham caused Liverpool all kinds of problems and twice led last season's Premier League runners up, both times through Aleksandar Mitrovic. Liverpool recovered through an inspired performance from new signing Darwin Nunez, but were unable to take all three points from Craven Cottage. During Klopp's pre-match press conference a journalist asked how he plans on combatting his team's ""slow start"" from the weekend, which clearly irked the German. ""That's easy. That's a silly question a little bit,"" Klopp said. ""By not being slow!"" The journalist suggested that this was perhaps a pattern that was beginning to emerge toward the back end of last season, to which Klopp responded: ""Towards the end, you can't compare that. Your life is so easy! After 55 games, and then you tell me 'oh that was a slow start.' What do you want? ""These are completely different situations, this is the start of the season. I promise you."" Liverpool's new strike force is up and running ü§ù pic.twitter.com/FK1gaWDcKt Liverpool face Crystal Palace on Monday night once the temperature in England drops from a sweltering 35 degrees. Klopp was asked about how this could impact his team's performance saying: ""It is much better to play at night time than at any other time, but for Crystal Palace it is the same advantage. It is much more comfortable of course."" The journalist asking the question suggested that Liverpool were being 'helped by the fixture list,' which enraged Klopp as he hit back with: ""Is this what you take out of it? ""It makes it a fair competition. If we had to play at night and Crystal Palace had to play in the heat that would be a real advantage, so it's just a game at night.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/silly-question-klopp-clash-journalist-mention-liverpool-slow/blt178c126442f2ea61,Ewan Gennery,8fbf0d45-d951-46ee-b14f-8c592ac060ae
"How ¬£50m Diaz deal, Elliott's return and Liverpool's resilience helped Klopp beat the January blues","Those who feared that January would be the month in which Liverpool‚Äôs season came off the rails needn‚Äôt have worried. Because, as we head into February, the Reds look to be in a stronger position than ever. Sure, there was a little deadline-day frustration.¬† A proposed deal to sign Fabio Carvalho, the exciting Fulham teenager, collapsed at the last minute, the Reds simply running out of time to complete the necessary paperwork on Monday evening. But when all is said and done, Jurgen Klopp can be satisfied by the way his team ‚Äì and his club ‚Äì have started 2022. Without Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Naby Keita for most of the month, Liverpool have managed to progress in both domestic cup competitions while simultaneously keeping their Premier League title hopes flickering.¬† They have a Carabao Cup final to look forward to, and a good chance of reaching the fifth round of the FA Cup when they entertain Championship side Cardiff City on Sunday. And, importantly, they were able to add to their squad in January too. Carvalho isn‚Äôt coming ‚Äì not yet, anyway ‚Äì but Luis Diaz is, the Reds moving quickly, and a little unexpectedly, to pip Tottenham to the Porto and Colombia winger‚Äôs signature. It was, as it turned out, one of the biggest deals of the window. We have completed the signing of Luis Diaz from FC Porto, subject to the successful granting of a work permit and international clearance ‚úçÔ∏èüòÑ  #VamosLuis Diaz, a 25-year-old who has made huge strides in Portugal over the past 18 months, should add plenty to Klopp‚Äôs side.¬† A right-footer who plays on the left, he will provide competition for Sadio Mane, in particular, and allow Klopp to better juggle his attacking options as Liverpool seek to attack four competitions in the coming months. Depth has long been a concern, particularly in forward areas, but with Divock Origi and Takumi Minamino staying at Anfield despite interest from elsewhere late in the window, the Reds look well-stocked for now. Salah and Mane will be back once the Africa Cup of Nations is concluded this weekend, Diogo Jota is flying and Roberto Firmino remains.¬† Even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has filled in on the right flank during the last month, is in good form, while teenage prospect Kaide Gordon will surely benefit from the first-team exposure he has received in recent weeks. Then there are the midfielders. Harvey Elliott made an encouraging return to action in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Wrexham at Kirkby on Saturday, scoring and assisting during an hour-long run out. The 18-year-old should play some part against Cardiff, and Liverpool hope that Thiago Alcantara will be able to return to team training this week after a hip injury that has sidelined him since December. Keita, too, is back from Afcon, where he performed well in an average Guinea side, and suddenly Klopp may have some brutal decisions to make. Namely, who does he leave out of his 20-man matchday squad? Liverpool allowed two players to leave on deadline day, both on loan to clubs chasing promotion from the Championship.¬† Nat Phillips, whose opportunities have been almost non-existent this season, has moved to Bournemouth, where he will relish the chance to play regularly, while Neco Williams is off to Fulham. An opportunity for the young right-back to step out of Trent Alexander-Arnold‚Äôs shadow, for sure, but also, perhaps, a potential sweetener in any future negotiation for Carvalho. Williams‚Äô departure does, ostensibly, leave Liverpool short at full-back, although Klopp would have little worry about asking either James Milner or Joe Gomez to fill in there if necessary.¬† Longer-term, the development of Conor Bradley, already a full international with Northern Ireland at 18, will be watched closely. It promises to be an intriguing few months, and an intriguing few weeks.¬† Liverpool return to league action against Leicester on February 10 and then play two of the Premier League‚Äôs bottom four sides, Burnley and Norwich, before the month is out.¬† They also have the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie away at Inter, before finishing with the Carabao Cup final at Wembley against Chelsea. Exciting times, indeed, for Reds supporters. Having been frustrated in December and fretted over January, what will February bring for the men from Merseyside?",https://www.goal.com/en/news/diaz-in-progress-made-how-liverpool-avoided-january-blues/bltfafeab2e5ef9d0de,Neil Jones,85698d11-dbcc-40dc-9fb0-3dd1866d5fa4

Overlooked by Tottenham & Newcastle but Fonseca remains determined to achieve Premier League coaching dream,"Former Roma boss Paulo Fonseca has told GOAL that he has not given up on his dream of managing in the Premier League despite missing out on jobs at Tottenham and Newcastle. Fonseca was close to joining Spurs before talks broke down late in the day, and he was then linked with Newcastle following the sacking of Steve Bruce in October 2021. The 49-year-old has had a number of other offers since leaving the Italian club, but is waiting for the right opportunity and would jump at the chance to work in England. ""The football in England is no longer what they used to call 'kick-and-run', today you have the best teams and the best football in the world,"" he told GOAL. ""I was very close at the beginning of the season to Tottenham but these things didn't happen like they didn't happen with Newcastle, but let's see in the future, I believe it will happen. ""Everyone would like to work in England, to live the fantastic atmosphere you have in England. It's a different culture, even from the supporters, the way they live and love the game, it's a different thing you cannot find in another country."" Fonseca looked certain to take over at Spurs but a disagreement with Fabio Paratici over his attacking style of football ultimately cost him the job.  Portuguese compatriot Nuno Espirito Santo took over but was replaced by Antonio Conte following his sacking in November 2021.  Fonseca was also among the candidates to take over at St James' Park before Newcastle opted for former Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe, who appears to have steered them to safety. Fonseca, who is in Glasgow this weekend to coach a team at Rangers' Weekend of Legends 150th anniversary celebrations, left Roma at the end of last season. Despite turning down a number of offers he has enjoyed a year away from the game, although he admits he is desperate to get back into coaching if the right opportunity comes along. ""I never stopped in my career before, this was the first season and I I have to confess it was very positive,"" he added. ""You have an opportunity to see, to learn from other coaches, to watch other teams and so to stop was very positive for me."" The former Shakhtar Donetsk manager, who has a Ukrainian wife and child, was forced to flee from the country following the Russian invasion last month. Fonseca has friends and colleagues that have remained in the country and has called on more to be done to help the people of Ukraine. ""I was in Kyiv - my wife is Ukrainian and I have a three-year-old so it was really difficult. But it continues to be much more difficult for the people there,"" he said. ""I have many friends who cannot leave the country and the situation is really difficult. I don't know how long the world can allow this tragedy because we see it on the TV, but after we switch off and we carry on with our lives, but the people continue to suffer. ""They are very brave, they want to continue to defend their country but the situation is really difficult.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/tottenham-newcastle-fonseca-determined-premier-league/blt23d5bb523d1c0ef0,Jonathan Smith,d33df999-ccde-4986-a56b-7ee492766d29
"New Man City signings Haaland and Alvarez can play together, says Guardiola","Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola insists that Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland can both start up front for the Citizens in the right system. The young strikers are both new faces at the Etihad Stadium, having signed this summer from River Plate and Borussia Dortmund respectively.  While Haaland is a familiar face in Europe thanks to his Champions League and Bundesliga exploits, Alvarez is somewhat more of an unknown quantity.  But Guardiola believes he is has already acclimated to life at City and backed the Argentina international to make a big impact.  ""If we play with tighter wings, I see [Alvarez] as complementary to Haaland,"" the manager explained to ESPN when asked if the pair would share the pitch.  ""If we play with more open flanks, not so much.""  Guardiola added on Alvarez: ""Julian has already adapted. A good player can adapt in the space of two afternoons.  ""If you've got it, you've got it in Argentina and in England.""  The 22-year-old has played his entire professional career to date under Marcelo Gallardo at River, an experience that Pep believes is crucial to ensuring he can hit the ground running at his new club.  ""We were not wrong about Julian. He is a team player,"" he continued.  ""He can score, he knows where the goal is. He is an extraordinary signing. We are going to make the most of Gallardo's work and we hope to add some things to his game. We want him to feel good, he has already adapted. ""Julian has come from a big team, with the obligation to win and keep winning. That is what River is about, just like Boca. That is drummed into a player's head.

Zaha elated as strike against Norwich City voted Crystal Palace‚Äôs Goal of the Season,"Ivory Coast international Wilfried Zaha‚Äôs effort for Crystal Palace against Norwich City in the Premier League has been voted Goal of the Season by the fans. During the fixture on February 9 at Carrow Road, it was the relegated Canaries, who took the lead courtesy of Teemu Pukki but the 29-year-old Ivorian star levelled matters for the Eagles with a wonder goal for a deserved point. Zaha received a great pass from midfielder Michael Olise with 30 minutes left to the final whistle, he then cut in from the left-wing before launching a powerful effort past goalkeeper Angus Gunn into the top-right corner. Palace have confirmed on their official website, that the goal which was also named Premier League Goal of the Month and the club‚Äôs Goal of the Month for February, has been voted the best, after beating strikes from Conor Gallagher and U18s‚Äô Jadan Raymond. ‚ÄúCrystal Palace fans have voted Wilfried [Zaha‚Äôs] strike against Norwich City away as their 2021-22 Goal of the Season,‚Äù read part of the statement. ‚ÄúZaha beat strikes from Conor Gallagher and the U18s‚Äô Jadan Raymond to scoop the award, with Palace Women and U23 players also involved.‚Äù Congratulations, Wilf üëä#CPFC pic.twitter.com/5LHeCWbvI9 Speaking after receiving the award, Zaha admitted it was one of his best goals. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely one of my best goals.

Ronaldo becomes first person to pass 400m Instagram followers,"Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first person to pass 400 million followers on Instagram. Ronaldo has established himself as one of football's all-time greats across a glittering 22-year career, breaking all kinds of individual records for goals while also winning the biggest team prizes the game has to offer. Despite turning 37 on Saturday, the Portuguese is showing little sign of slowing down, and his popularity away from the pitch only appears to be growing. Ronaldo is the first person to reach 400 million followers on Instagram, with his account second only to the platform's official handle - which currently has 469 million. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was first to reach the 200 million followers mark in January 2020 and has managed to double that number in just two years, with Paris Saint-Germain's Lionel Messi the second most followed footballer on Instagram at just over 300 million.

Ronaldo has been firmly in the spotlight once again since returning to United from Juventus last summer, and has scored 14 goals in 24 appearances for the club so far this season.

'Vision 2030': Inside Chelsea's plan to ensure their academy keeps producing England's top talents,"As Chelsea's players returned to their Porto hotel after hoisting the European Cup a few hours earlier, some of the club's homegrown talents were keen to celebrate with a couple of coaches in particular. The club's academy bosses, Neil Bath and Jim Fraser, were both in Portugal to watch Reece James and Mason Mount play prominent roles for the Blues as they won the Champions League for the second time in their history. It was a crowning moment for Chelsea's youth setup; a sign that a consistent run of success at age-group levels could be translated into first-team silverware. Along with James and Mount, the likes of Tammy Abraham, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Fikayo Tomori and Billy Gilmour had all emerged over the course of the past two seasons, earning their chances under Frank Lampard before Thomas Tuchel took up the management reins. The sheer number of academy graduates within the Chelsea first team in recent seasons has seen a bond grow between the squad and the club's fans. But the Blues are not about to rest on its laurels when it comes to youth development, particularly given the current state of uncertainty surrounding Stamford Bridge. The ongoing parting of ways between Chelsea and owner Roman Abramovich has left all areas of the club in a state of limbo, with the academy's success owing a lot to the billions of pounds the Russian oligarch has pumped into the west London outfit over the past 19 years. Regardless of the club's sale, though, Chelsea have been keen to maintain their momentum at youth level, rather than rest on their laurels following their recent success. Manchester City and Liverpool have begun breathing down Chelsea's neck within the youth game, while Manchester United have been busy revamping their own setup in the past couple of years. For Chelsea, that is where 'Vision 2030' comes in. ""It involves our board and owner, who are keen to hear our innovative and creative ideas, which will see us kick on for the next five to 10 years,"" Bath explained back in June. ""I can assure people that we will not rest on our laurels of having boys involved in Champions League success.  ""It‚Äôs important to set out what we are doing in the short term, but also to have a long-term vision and direction of where we want our academy to be in the future. That is always the main focus."" Though that aforementioned owner is changing, the club's academy policy is not. 'Vision 2030' is an all-encompassing root-and-branch review of the work being done in the academy building at Cobham, involving scouts, nutritionists, analysts and technology departments. They aim to tackle the changing landscape of English football, with the quality of football in the lower leagues and non-league improving, while Brexit has stopped Premier League sides from looking overseas for youngsters. The plan has already been put in action.  Chelsea have been actively scouting non-league clubs and, in January, signed forward Mason Burstow having seen him impress for Charlton Athletic after spending time on trial at Cobham while he was playing for Maidstone United. They have also continued to look for younger players of potential at other English clubs, with West Brom duo Leo Cardoso and Kiano Dyer having moved to the club in the past year. The pair are both England youth internationals ‚Äì though Cardoso has also represented Portugal ‚Äì and, at 15, are still of an age where they can be moulded by Chelsea's coaches. Perhaps the main challenge for Chelsea now is to prove that the pathway to the senior side still exists, with only Trevoh Chalobah having broken into the first-team picture since Tuchel took over. While Abraham and Tomori were deemed surplus to requirements by the German before completing big-money moves to Serie A, other youth products who left in the summer of 2021, such as Marc Guehi, Tino Livramento and Lewis Bate, did so before even earning an opportunity to impress at Stamford Bridge. Guehi and Livramento have been among the breakout stars of the current Premier League season, with the former having earned his first call-up to the England squad last week. Others, like Tariq Lamptey and Jamal Musiala, have also flown the nest in recent years without having made their debuts, with Musiala placing fourth on the NXGN 2022 list of the world's best teenage footballers following his performances for Bayern Munich. The Blues now face a fight to ensure the likes of Armando Broja, Conor Gallagher and Levi Colwill ‚Äì their only representative on this year's NXGN list ‚Äì do follow the same route out of the club following impressive loan spells in 2021-22. England international Gallagher is expected to return and fight for a first-team berth following his strong showings for Crystal Palace, but there is competition to acquire Broja, with his loan club Southampton, as well as West Ham, keen on signing the striker. Colwill, meanwhile, was targeted by Leicester City in January as they aimed to take him on loan midway through his spell at Huddersfield Town, but the Foxes' bid was rejected by Chelsea. These players, as well as those who are still predominantly playing youth-team football, know their worth in what has, post-Brexit, become a shrinking market, and are willing to run down the three-year professional contracts they receive at the age of 17 in a bid to force their way into the senior ranks. Xavier Simons, who made his first-team debut earlier this season, is the latest player who could depart, with a host of Premier League clubs monitoring his situation as he enters the final months of his contract, while the club is working hard to ensure that Harvey Vale, the star of the club's Under-23s side, does not follow in a year's time. Tuchel, for his part, has been active in maintaining a relationship with the academy and regularly reaches out to the likes of Bath for advice on the latest batch of youngsters who could soon be at his disposal. The former Paris Saint-Germain coach also tries to attend as many academy matches as he can in a bid to see first-hand what he might have to work with in the coming years. ‚ÄúThe door is always open,"" Tuchel said of his relationship with the academy. ""I love it, and I truly believe the supporters love it. ""The mix between big names from abroad, big personalities, and famous players, with the academy guys is what makes a club special. ‚ÄúWhen you look at the photo when we raised the Champions League trophy, there are so many boys from the academy in this photo. That makes it special, and this is how it has to be. It is always about the mix.‚Äù It is the job, then, of 'Vision 2030' to ensure that the conveyor belt of talent keeps on providing the first team with what it requires. Now, perhaps more than ever, Chelsea needs its academy to continue thriving.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/vision-2030-inside-chelsea-plan-academy-england-top-talents/blt1f89895a3d237701,Nizaar Kinsella,912f961c-4145-4809-9e1c-d2fa09ca6b80
Man Utd star Bruno Fernandes reveals odd pre-match superstition & when it takes place,"WHAT HAPPENED? The Portugal international has starred for the Red Devils since joining them from Sporting in the winter transfer window of 2020, with his stock rising to the point that he has taken on captaincy duties of late. He believes that certain pre-game practices help him to perform at his best, with a number of boxes having to be ticked before he can feel entirely comfortable with his game. WHAT THEY SAID: Fernandes has told United‚Äôs official website of his superstitions: ‚ÄúI always do the same. I like to do breakfast or lunch - depends on the time of the game. Something I always do is speak with my kids and my wife before we leave the hotel because after when I go on the bus I don‚Äôt text anyone, I don‚Äôt answer phones, so I like to be focused on the game after that and when you get to Old Trafford for me it is game on from there. ‚ÄúThat is one of the superstitions and the other one is I always enter on the pitch with the left foot [first] that is something that I always do, something that I believe can help me in some way. Not to get a better performance but to be myself.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Fernandes has taken in 130 appearances for United, with an impressive haul of 51 goals recorded across those outings. He has been skippering the side following Erik ten Hag‚Äôs decision to drop Harry Maguire. IN THREE PHOTOS:    DID YOU KNOW? Only Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min have scored more Premier League goals than Bruno Fernandes since his debut in February 2020. WHAT NEXT FOR FERNANDES?

Borussia Dortmund explain Haaland's Munich trip in wake of striker's meeting with Barcelona coach Xavi,"Borussia Dortmund's head of first-team football Sebastian Kehl has explained why Erling Haaland took a trip to Munich last week amid reports that the striker had a meeting with Barcelona boss Xavi. Haaland is currently the most in-demand striker in European football, with the likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea all having been credited with an interest in his services ahead of the summer transfer window. Barca has also been touted as a possible next destination for the 21-year-old, and Xavi has reportedly been to Germany to try and convince him that Camp Nou is the best place for him to reach his full potential. Haaland and Xavi were both present in Munich last week, but Kehl has insisted that the former was only there under instruction from Dortmund as he continues his recovery from a muscle injury. ""We tried to optimise a few things, it's also not unusual to get a second opinion,"" the BVB chief told Ruhr Nachrichten. ""That's why he was in Munich."" Pressed on whether Haaland could be fit enough to return to action when Marco Rose's team take on Arminia Bielefeld on March 13, Kehl replied: ""That's open."" Xavi did little to quash the speculation linking Haaland with Barca when he was quizzed on the alleged meeting with Haaland. Speaking before his side's 2-1 win at Elche, the Spaniard told reporters: ‚ÄúI can't give details. ‚ÄúI can only say that we are working for both the present and the future of the club."" Haaland remains contracted to Dortmund until 2024, but it has been reported that he has a ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£62m/$81m) release clause in his contract that will become active later this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/borussia-dortmund-explain-haaland-munich-trip-meeting/blt252df957b2dcb42c,James Westwood,05d24f82-705c-466e-b8b4-9a11674111bb
"Liverpool's Salah has broken Premier League records, is he the greatest in history of the competition? - fans debate","The debate is raging among fans online as to whether Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah is the Premier League‚Äôs best player ever as he has broken numerous records in England‚Äôs top flight. Salah has been Liverpool‚Äôs top scorer since he joined them from AS Roma in 2017 and this season is no different as he leads the Reds and Premier League‚Äôs scoring charts with 30 goals in all competitions and 22 in the league. In his five years on Merseyside, the Egyptian has broken a number of Premier League records. He has the most goals in one season (32), has scored in a record five straight opening match days and has the most Premier League Player of the Months awards in one season, having won three in 2017-18, his maiden campaign with Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side. Salah also holds the record for most teams scored against and most games scored in, in one season (18 and 24 respectively), while also outscoring three Premier League teams in a season when he had more goals than West Bromwich Albion (31) as well as Huddersfield Town and Swansea City who had 28 a piece in the 2017-18 campaign. He holds several other records but fans still cannot agree whether he is the Premier League‚Äôs best-ever player. ‚Äú37-year-old [Cristiano] Ronaldo is playing better than prime Salah. If we were better this season, Ronaldo would have outscored Salah comfortably,‚Äù said Manchester United fan @Marouane95523 in reply to @FootballFunnnys‚Äôs tweet. Some fans feel former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer, who scored a Premier League record 260 goals, is still the best the league has ever seen. ‚ÄúBut he never broke Alan Shearer's Premier League goals,‚Äù responded @D1AO4. Others feel some Reds legends are better than Salah, who is only thriving due to the system he is playing in at Liverpool. ‚ÄúGood player but would have only been a squad player years ago,‚Äù replied @stevenmcPGA. He went on: ‚ÄúFootball has changed, more fitness and systems have taken over natural ability and direct football in the last 10 years. Salah is worse than [Robbie] Fowler, [Fernando] Torres, [Michael] Owen, [Ian] Rush etc.‚Äù For some, Salah does not deserve the plaudits while others think Drogba remains the best African to grace the Premier League. ‚ÄúMost overrated player,‚Äù commented @icik___ with @wildin_2 adding: ‚ÄúBest African player to grace the Prem [Premier League], after Didier [Drogba] of course.‚Äù Salah was not on target when Liverpool beat Villarreal 3-2 in the Uefa Champions League semi-final second-leg match at Estadio de la Ceramica on Tuesday but his goals have been key as the club remains in contention for an unprecedented quadruple.

PSG sporting director Leonardo admits club may have made Ramos 'mistake',"Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo has admitted the club may have made a ""mistake"" by signing Sergio Ramos. Ramos' trophy-laden 16-year career at Real Madrid came to an end when his final contract expired in June 2021. PSG subsequently snapped the 35-year-old up on a free transfer, but he's struggled with injuries throughout his first season at Parc des Princes. Ramos only played four games for Madrid in the six months before his departure due to a string of different fitness issues, but PSG still took the decision to hand him a two-year contract. A serious calf problem has since limited the Spaniard's contribution to Mauricio Pochettino's side, leaving Leonardo and the rest of the board hugely disappointed. The PSG chief hasn't completely given up on Ramos but does concede he made an error by initially targeting him, as he told L'Equipe: ""We signed him and he was physically fine. But as of today, he has only played five games. ""Unfortunately, what we imagined of him at our club did not happen. It is difficult for him, for everyone. ""Not playing makes it difficult for him to be a leader. We will wait before drawing conclusions, the season is not over. ""But I am not afraid to take responsibility for mistakes when I make them. ""Nasser gives me total confidence. It gives me real autonomy and for that I thank the club."" Ramos has been restricted to just five appearances for PSG across all competitions to date, including only four in Ligue 1. The World Cup winner scored his first goal for the club in a 4-0 win over Reims on January 3, but hasn't played since as he's suffered a reoccurrence of his calf problem. Ramos missed PSG's latest training session ahead of a clash with Nice this weekend and is not expected to be fit in time for the second leg of their round of 16 Champions League tie with Real Madrid either.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-sporting-director-leonardo-admits-club-may-have-made/bltdf7654e2de716616,James Westwood,a03f6be4-5dc4-437d-a7bc-da9119e1ed89

Davies has not seen any competitive minutes for Bayern so far in 2022, with a positive Covid-19 test in early January followed by an even more concerning health issue. The 21-year-old was diagnosed with mild myocarditis, and the club have since been carefully managing his recovery. Davies was once again unavailable for Bayern's latest Bundesliga outing against Hoffenheim on Saturday, which ended in a 1-1 draw. However, the club released a video the following day showing the Canada international back in training, with the caption: ""Guess who's back, back again, PHONZY'S BACK, in training."" Davies has only resumed light training for now but his heart inflammation has subsided enough for him to now start thinking about a return to action in the near future. üéµ Guess who's back, back againPHONZY'S BACK, in training üéµ@AlphonsoDavies üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôå pic.twitter.com/1DXwUHfjuv Bayern's medical staff re-examined Davies before his return to training, and Nagelsmann says his outlook is now far more positive.

Fernandes to sign new ¬£240k-a-week Man Utd contract that will double his wages & offers boost during dismal season - reports,"Bruno Fernandes is reportedly set to sign a bumper new contract at Manchester United that will double his wage packet to around ¬£240,000 a week. Various outlets, including The Athletic and The Times, are claiming that the Portugal international playmaker is to be rewarded with fresh terms at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have put a lucrative offer on the table after seeing a player snapped up from Sporting CP in January 2020 become an important part of their immediate and long-term plans. When the 27-year-old made the move to England from Sporting, Fernandes was said to be earning ¬£50,000 a week at the Portuguese giants, with United nudging those terms into six figures. A long-term contract signed at that time is due to take the midfielder through to the summer of 2025, with there the option for a 12-month extension to be taken up beyond that point. United are, however, prepared to reward a player snapped up for ¬£47 million ($62m) with a lucrative upgrade after seeing him impress across two years in the Premier League. Bruno Fernandes joined Manchester United two years ago today.What a signing, what a player üî• pic.twitter.com/iJxPbRAH2a The Red Devils are said to have first explored the option of improving Fernandes‚Äô terms in November 2020, with an immediate impact made by a classy addition to the Old Trafford ranks. His new deal will push him into the group of top earners at United, with that particular chart currently topped by fellow countryman Cristiano Ronaldo ‚Äì who pulls in more than ¬£400,000 a week. Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea is on ¬£375,000 a week, while Paul Pogba, Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho, Edinson Cavani and Marcus Rashford are all believed to be paid ¬£200,000 a week or more, and club captain Harry Maguire is another that sits close to that mark. Fernandes wasted little time in becoming a talismanic presence for United following his arrival in the winter transfer window of 2020. He registered 12 goals and eight assists through his opening 22 appearances for the club, before raising the bar even higher in his first full season with the club. The 2021-21 campaign delivered 18 Premier League goals, and 28 in all competitions, while a further 18 efforts were teed up for grateful team-mates. Those standards have dipped slightly this season, with United enduring a testing and trophyless 2021-22 campaign.

Tottenham are due to play seven matches in the next 21 days, and the coach has said he will need to rest players to keep the squad fresh. Starting August 27, Spurs play five Premier League games and two Champions League fixtures before an international break. WHAT THEY SAID: Conte insisted: ""One player will not be able to play in all seven games. It is impossible. I am not a magician! ""I cannot forecast this, but we go game by game to make the best decisions for the team and for the players. It‚Äôs crazy to think we can play always the same players.‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Harry Kane has not missed a meaningful game in either the Premier League or Champions League for over four years when fit. He has sat out games in domestic cup competitions and in the Europa League and Europa Conference League, but rarely misses games with something riding on them. IN THREE PHOTOS: DID YOU KNOW? Kane missed the first game-and-a-half of last season, a game against Bayern Munich and a fixture vs Leicester, but has otherwise been selected if fit. WHAT NEXT FOR KANE? As mentioned the games are coming thick and fast, and Kane and his team-mates start this hectic schedule against Nottingham Forest when they visit the newly promoted club on August 28.

Welcome to Wrexham! Ryan Reynolds reveals Premier League dream for club owned by Hollywood stars,"WHAT HAPPENED? The two Hollywood stars have become well-loved figures in North Wales after taking over as club owners at the Racecourse Ground in February 2021. They have both made it clear, since day one, that they would eventually love to take Wrexham to the Premier League, although they are under no illusions that it is a very tough task.WHAT HE SAID: Speaking to Sky Sports on the day their docuseries released in the UK, Reynolds was asked if top-flight promotion is an achievable aspiration. He responded: ""Anything can happen in football. You could put together the greatest team on earth and some giant killer comes along and takes out Man United. ""Anything can happen in this sport so why couldn‚Äôt Wrexham theoretically make it all the way to the Premier League one day? This is the place where hopes and dreams are born every day so why not?‚Äù THE BIGGER PICTURE: Even if Wrexham are able to secure successive promotions, it will still be a number of years before it is even possible for them to reach the Premier League. They currently find themselves in the National League - the fifth tier of English (and Welsh) football - so plenty of progression is needed before they start to worry about trips to the likes of Old Trafford and Liverpool. IN THREE PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR WREXHAM? Last season ultimately ended in disappointment for Wrexham as they were beaten in the National League play-off semi-final by Grimsby Town, less than a week after losing the FA Trophy final at Wembley.

"Inter vs Juventus: Predictions, odds & betting tips ","Wednesday night sees Inter and Juventus meet in the Italian Super Cup in the latest edition in one of the country's fiercest rivalries, the Derby d'Italia. Juve are one of the few sides to have taken points off Inter in recent months in Serie A, with their meeting in October ending in a 1-1 draw. The Nerazzurri have been the dominant side in the Italian top flight this season and are understandably favourites to claim a victory against their rivals from Turin. Inter have won their last seven Serie A matches, are unbeaten domestically since October 16 and can be backed at 4/5 (1.80) with bet365. Juventus are making their 10th consecutive appearance in the Super Cup and are offered at 10/3 (4.33) with the draw priced at 13/5 (3.60). Lautaro Martinez is Inter's top domestic scorer this season with 11 strikes and the Argentine is the favourite to break the deadlock at 4/1 (5.00). Edin Dzeko is next in the betting at 9/2 (5.50) and the Bosnian scored first in the most recent meeting between the sides three months ago. Spanish striker Alvaro Morata is the shortest priced Juventus player to open the scoring at 7/1 (8.00). There is little doubt that Inter are the outstanding side in Italy this season and the current Serie A champions are firm favourites to retain their title. The Scudetto is obviously a priority, but if they can add some more silverware by claiming the Super Cup and defeat fierce enemies Juventus in the process that would be an attractive bonus for Inter and we should expect the Milan outfit to take the game seriously. Martinez and Dzkeo are the team's top scorers yet one of the Nerazzurri's strengths this season has been how goals come from all over the pitch; 16 different players have scored for Inter in Serie A. Juve have been uncharacteristically poor defensively this term and Inter will surely fancy their chances of getting among the goals on Wednesday night. Inter to score over 1.5 goals is priced at an attractive looking 4/5 (1.80). Juventus have conceded two or more goals seven times in Serie A and on a further two occasions in the Champions, while Inter have netted at least twice in nine of their last 11 matches with domestic opponents.

"No celebrations, half-time rows and a subdued Tuchel: Miserable Chelsea must lift morale to avoid unwanted top-four tussle","Normally, when a 25-yard, left-footed strike hits the back of the net, it is a moment of elation. Yet, Hakim Ziyech stood expressionless, even after his pressure-bursting 28th-minute strike lifted Chelsea supporters off their seats at Brighton‚Äôs Amex Stadium on Tuesday evening. The team-mates who ran over to congratulate him too failed to crack a smile, as if they were doing so out of politeness rather than expressing their thrill at taking the lead in a match they were otherwise struggling in. Over on the sidelines, manager Thomas Tuchel remained motionless, as he was for much of the 1-1 draw in a far cry from the usual frantic persona he takes on during matches. ""[Even] in the reaction of the goal [we scored], you can see that we are tired,"" the German coach told BT Sport post-match. ""We are relieved, but there is no joy."" Whether it is tiredness or misery at having seen their title hopes ended in the past few weeks, Chelsea fans might have forgiven their players for the lack of emotion they showed following Ziyech's strike. What was more concerning, however, was the sight of Ziyech and star striker Romelu Lukaku having what was at best a heated debate, at worst a full-on row, both as they left the field at half-time and as they awaited kick-off in the second half. It is clear that morale is low within the Chelsea dressing room, but the players must stick together if they are to salvage a season that could yet see them lift four trophies between now and the end of May. Hakim Ziyech and Romelu Lukaku are having a difference of opinions heading into the break, despite the Blues' lead... üëÄHT: Brighton 0-1 Chelsea pic.twitter.com/P3mGXTg9bp Adam Webster's deserved second-half equaliser for Brighton means it is now just one win in their last seven league matches for the Blues, leaving them to be suddenly looking nervously over their shoulders towards the clutch of teams battling it out for places in the top four. The west Londoners' run of four league matches without a win is also the worst such run for Tuchel himself since he managed Borussia Dortmund in October 2016. He was sacked at the end of that season, and 2021's The Best FIFA Men's Coach of the Year must now show how much he has improved as a manager to avoid a similar fate this time around. Excuses - both valid and otherwise - have been presented for the way in which Chelsea have fallen from being top of the table just over a month ago to now sitting 12 points behind Manchester City having played a game more than the leaders, but they will soon wear thin if results and performances continue to underwhelm. For now, tiredness is - according to Tuchel - to blame for his side's recent malaise. ""We are mentally tired and physically tired. You can see it in our performance. It's as easy as that,"" he said. ""You can say it is an excuse or whatever, but it's like this. Look at our schedule - when we arrived at Man City we had the Carabao Cup in the week and they did not. ""Now we arrive here and they have more days to prepare and the whole week before to prepare. ""It's like this. We play since November. We are the team that plays and plays and plays. We need to recharge the batteries, disconnect. This is my feeling, and it's why I've given the players two days off."" Whether Chelsea are any more tired than their rivals is a difficult question to answer, but they would certainly be excused for some of their poor results given the circumstances. Their first-choice wing-back duo, Reece James and Ben Chilwell, have both been lost to serious injuries, leaving Tuchel without two of his most dynamic playmakers at what is usually an attritional stage of the season. They also had to overcome a Covid-19 outbreak that left them short on numbers, though not short enough to postpone any matches, meaning they continued to play twice a week and created minor fitness issues for some of their overworked key players. To make matters worse, Lukaku‚Äôs unsanctioned interview with Sky Italia brought more negativity into the dressing room after the Belgium striker appeared to criticise Tuchel while speaking in glowing terms about his former club, Inter. Despite all that, there have been some positive results, though they have mainly come in the Carabao Cup, a competition which will offer Chelsea one of of two opportunities to lift some silverware in February, as they also have the Club World Cup to focus their attention at the start of next month. Those showpiece events are exciting and should be games that Chelsea can lift themselves out of their current funk for, but they must not distract from the main aim for the rest of the season: securing a top-four finish in the Premier League. The Blues recently announced post-tax losses of ¬£145.6 milion for the past year, and though that was in a large part due to the pandemic, it was a higher number than almost all Chelsea's rivals, showing the importance of qualifying for the Champions League for owner Roman Abramovich. Currently, many of the clubs chasing Chelsea down are in better form than them, and given they have known their aim for the season is a top-four finish for much longer, they have come to terms with that fact and got on with the job in hand. The European champions, on the other hand, look a little sorry for themselves at present, and fans would be forgiven for believing that playing for and coaching the club is becoming a chore, given the facial expressions of their heroes on the pitch and in the dugout. The time for misery, however, is over. Chelsea have a job to do, starting with Sunday's clash against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge, and they must approach it with a refreshed outlook, rather than reluctance.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/celebrations-rows-subdued-tuchel-miserable-chelsea-top-four/blt5930e3925a354496,Nizaar Kinsella,539017de-22a9-4cc8-978f-1ee74a2c08e4
'We are going to spend' - New U.S.-based Lyon owner claims he can match PSG's financial influence,"Lyon's American investor John Textor says that he believes his club can go toe-to-toe with Paris Saint-Germain as he says he intends to spend in an effort to compete in Ligue 1. Lyon have not won the French title since 2008, while PSG have established themselves as the dominant club in French football.  But, despite finishing seven spots and 27 points behind the Ligue 1 winners, Lyon's new owner believes that his team will soon be able to take down their free-spending rivals. ""I don't like these models like PSG,"" Textor said at a news conference. ""Great team, whatever, great athletes, we all love to watch them. ""I think over the few years we want to go after them. We want to win titles here. We are going to show up and we are going to spend."" He added: ""We can have as much capital at play in our football club as the Emir of Qatar."" Textor is a businessman that was formerly the Executive Chairman of fubo TV.  The American promised big spending as part of his purchase, which saw him promise a cash injection of ‚Ç¨86 million ($90 million) as part of a deal that valued the club at around ‚Ç¨800 million ($840 million). The purchase also included Lyon's dominant women's team, which has been crowned European champions in six of the last seven seasons, as well as the club's stadium.

'I do sprints and I feel it' - De Bruyne still recovering from impact of Covid-19,"Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne has revealed that he can still feel the impact of Covid-19 as he works his way back to full fitness.  De Bruyne scored twice in City's 7-0 victory over Leeds United on Tuesday night in his first Premier League start since contracting the illness.  The 30-year-old missed four matches with coronavirus to compound a difficult six months that saw him suffer ankle ligament damage at Euro 2020 as well as concussion and a broken nose after a nasty clash in last season's Champions League final defeat to Chelsea.  ""I still feel sometimes that my body is still adapting because sometimes I do two or three sprints and feel it, having had Covid,"" De Bruyne told reporters. ""I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôve played two full 90 minutes in the week, so that is a good thing.  ""Obviously this season is what it is. There is nothing I can do about it, I‚Äôve been kicked in the face, kicked in my ankle and I had Covid afterwards. It‚Äôs part of football.  ""After Covid, I came back and trained as hard as I can. With the schedule it is not that easy but I‚Äôm doing alright, I played in two games and came in as a sub in two so I‚Äôm doing what I need to do.  ""I was 10 days on my own so I was running up the walls. I can‚Äôt sit still anyway. I got away from my family as I didn‚Äôt think we had it as a family and I didn‚Äôt want to give it to my wife and kids. It was pretty hard to see them through a glass door.""  The injuries have given an opportunity to other players with Bernardo Silva in particular in dazzling form this season in central midfield.  De Bruyne is facing a fight to win back a regular place in the side but the Belgian international says he has had competition ever since he joined the club.  ""It‚Äôs been like this since the beginning, since I came here,"" he said. ""I know the team is incredible, talented, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm a competitor.  ""I‚Äôm here to take part and I know there are some games I‚Äôll sit out and that is never a nice feeling.

Thiago in tears on bench after Liverpool midfielder ruled out of Carabao Cup final vs Chelsea due to injury in the warm-up,"Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara was left in tears on Sunday when he was forced to miss the Carabao Cup final clash against Chelsea. The midfielder had been named in the starting XI but suffered an injury in the warm-up to the game. He was subsequently ruled out of the Wembley showpiece and replaced by Naby Keita. After he was given the news, the Spain international was seen crying on the bench due to his disappointment. Thiago had to be consoled by team-mate Alisson while he watched the rest of the team prepare for kick-off. The problem the 30-year-old suffered on Sunday is not his first injury this season.

'Barcelona live in the past!' - Koeman takes shot at Xavi's possession tactics and expresses doubts about Lewandowski transfer,"Ronald Koeman has accused Barcelona of living in the past as the Dutch coach took aim at his former club. Koeman was dismissed in October and was replaced by club legend Xavi in the dugout. And Koeman, who is set to take over the Netherlands national team for Louis van Gaal after the World Cup, says Barca is still living in the past and have not grown from a reliance on tiki-taka possession-based football. ""I am in favor of dominating the game,"" he told Esport3. ""If you play with three central defenders and five defenders, you cannot say that it is a defensive system.  ""With this system for three or four months we played the best games in recent years. The clearest example was the final against Athletic.  ""Barca lives in the past, from 4-3-3, from 'tiki-taka'. Football has changed. Now it's faster, more physical. You can't live in the past."" The Dutch manager also weighed in on the club's links to Robert Lewandowski, who has expressed his desire to leave Bayern Munich this summer. Koeman is a fan of the Poland star, but says he has doubts about paying a big fee to secure Lewandowski's services. ""Lewandowski is a great player, a regular goalscorer, but he is of a certain age,"" he said. ""35 years old? I have my doubts about paying 50 or 60 million for a player, in addition to his salary. ""Maybe he has two years left. I would have many doubts about signing him or not sign him.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-live-in-the-past-koeman-xavi-tactics-lewandowski/blt748b9d784cd27886,Ryan Tolmich,9eb7ea0b-c4aa-4bbf-a671-ecc3ab8e3cb0
"Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea - What are the Premier League title contenders' biggest weaknesses?","The gruelling winter schedule officially gets under way this weekend. It‚Äôs the time of year managers hate but supporters love, when the matches come so thick and fast it is easy to lose sight of the league table altogether.¬† But when we come up for air on January 2 there will have been 21 rounds of Premier League action played. The table could change dramatically. The most interesting area likely to be affected is at the top, where Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea are separated by two points in a title challenge that looks likely to go to the wire.¬† All three teams have six league games in the space of 23 days, while Chelsea and Liverpool also have an EFL Cup quarter-final this month.¬† It will be a hectic time likely to expose any flaws in the respective camps, and certainly by the time Liverpool meet Chelsea at Stamford Bridge right at the end of the festive period things could look decidedly different at the top. With that in mind, here‚Äôs a look at the respective weaknesses of each of the three title challengers, none of which are likely to appear quite so strong after playing so many games in such a short space of time. The winter schedule takes its toll. Pep Guardiola‚Äôs most pressing issue remains the lack of an out-and-out striker, because despite being top of the league, rotating a different player each week into the number nine role is decreasing their goalscoring return.  City have scored the fewest of the three title contenders, 32 in 15 games, which is their lowest goals-per-game average (2.1) since Guardiola‚Äôs first season in charge ‚Äì when City finished third. Four of their wins this season have been by a single goal, including their last two against West Ham United and Aston Villa, and both of these teams were unlucky not to take a point thanks to late rallies.  City need to be able to put games to bed a bit better, but more concerning than that is the 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, the 0-0 draw with Southampton, and the 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. Again, this is hardly a disaster considering their league position, but it could become a problem when legs and minds tire during the festive period.  And the problem is not just about missing a ruthless touch in the penalty area; in the above three games, City looked too slow, unable to open up a low block due to constantly playing in front of the defence. They have lacked penetration since Leroy Sane‚Äôs departure, a problem symbolised in how Jack Grealish is struggling to settle. He persistently receives the ball, holds it, then plays a simple pass inside, unsure of his licence to be creative.¬† Perhaps things will improve once Kevin De Bruyne is back to full match fitness, but for now Grealish represents City‚Äôs lack of creative spark that, by going against the grain, confuses defenders and pierces a defensive blockade. Defensively, Man City are very strong, although a few errors have crept into their game recently. They are starting to look slightly vulnerable to incisive counters played in behind their high defensive line whenever Aymeric Laporte or John Stones are playing.¬† Looking at their upcoming games, Wolves may be capable of forcing a frustrating 0-0 draw and Leeds United will test any new difficulty in the transition, but after that they face a run against teams at a low ebb: Newcastle, Leicester, Brentford, and Arsenal.¬† The 3-3 draw with Brentford and 2-2 draw with Brighton have raised some concerns about Liverpool‚Äôs ability to defend counterattacks, and as we wrote in November analysis of their goals conceded this season shows the main issue is missing Georginio Wijnaldum from midfield. His metronomic presence in the middle, evading opposition challenges and recycling the ball intelligently, helped Liverpool to control games in their 2019-20 title-winning year ‚Äì in which 14 of their league wins were by a single goal. That capacity to take the lead and hold onto it has disintegrated. Wijnaldum‚Äôs positional awareness from the left-centre of midfield was also crucial in breaking up counters or stamping them out at source, while by contrast his frequent replacements ‚Äì Alex Oxlade Chamberlain or Curtis Jones ‚Äì have made subtle errors in the build-up to concessions against Brighton, Brentford, and Atletico Madrid. These defensive issues, exacerbated by Virgil van Dijk being below his best as he continues his recovery from an ACL injury, could hurt Liverpool when the games are every few days.  Aston Villa, Tottenham, Leeds, Leicester, and Chelsea are all tough matches that will contain moments in which Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs formation is stretched.¬† Going forward, there is arguably an over-reliance on Mohamed Salah‚Äôs genius. They are lacking that extra creative spark from midfield ‚Äì the one Harvey Elliot would have been providing ‚Äì and will lose Salah and Sadio Mane to the AFCON in January.¬† Liverpool need to rack up points before then, but unfortunately they seem most likely of the three title contenders to be exposed through the remainder of December. The most winter-proof of the three clubs is probably Chelsea, whose machine-like consistency this season is backed up with squad depth and tactical variation.  It is worth noting that they have only dropped points this season against Liverpool, Man City, Burnley (when they somehow failed to convert a 2.88xG into more than one goal), and West Ham. Goalscoring is said to be their biggest weakness. Even before Romelu Lukaku‚Äôs injuries he did not appear to be settling well, often playing with his back to goal and looking more like the Manchester United-era target man than the agile transitional striker we saw at Inter.  Whether that is a deliberate strategy by Thomas Tuchel remains to be seen, although his good combinations with Timo Werner in the 3-3 draw with Zenit were encouraging. However, Opta have Chelsea‚Äôs xG at 26.19, well below their actual tally of 35, while they have the second-best conversion rate in the division, at 14.77 per cent.  Generally speaking, they are scoring more than they should based on chance creation, although a ‚ÄòBig Chance‚Äô conversion rate of just 46.15% ‚Äì the eighth highest in the division ‚Äì does point to some glaring misses. The real flaw is chance creation in games when the opponent chooses to sit deep. Tuchel has been at pains to get his team playing quickly through the lines and setting their forwards in behind the defence at the earliest opportunity, and yet most of the time they are unable to do this. Instead, Chelsea can look a little bit mechanical, with the precision of their build-up play and strict positioning becoming an issue when faced with a brick wall.  It‚Äôs only a minor worry for now, and one that Reece James‚Äôs influence is largely making irrelevant, although it could become an issue down the line. But probably not this winter.  They have the easiest fixtures of all, playing Leeds, Everton, Wolves, Brentford, Villa, and Brighton before they welcome Liverpool to Stamford Bridge in January. None of those teams will absorb pressure from a low block, aside from Everton, whose two-man midfield should be easy for Chelsea to overwhelm. Chelsea, then, are the most likely to emerge from the Christmas period at the top of the Premier League table.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-liverpool-chelsea-who-will-be-top-of-the-premier-league-/blt5cdc0c1904f2cffc,Alex Keble,9491648c-72f3-4129-ad17-3c81d897e65c
'Most games in Europe!' - Azpilicueta explains why Chelsea haven't challenged Man City & Liverpool in Premier League title race,"Cesar Azpilicueta believes that Chelsea's 54 matches in all competitions help explain why the club have been unable to mount a serious challenge for the Premier League title this season. The Blues have played more matches than any of their European counterparts after participation in the Club World Cup, alongside their runs to two domestic cup finals.¬† And Azpilicueta believes that gruelling run,¬†along with a host of injuries and Covid cases in the winter, has meant the club has been unable to keep up with Liverpool and Manchester City in the league.¬† ""The reality from last season is that we closed the gap from them (Liverpool and Man City) in the Premier League, but not enough to be challenging for the title,"" Azpilicueta said at Wembley Stadium after his side's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace.¬† ""We arrived in the Carabao Cup final and lost on penalties. In the two games in the Premier League [against Liverpool] we drew both.¬† ""In a final, it is different ‚Äì one game.

We go for every competition until the end and we will keep doing the same."" Azpilicueta added on Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who scored the opener in the FA Cup semi-final and was one of the Blues' better players on the day: ""He has always been open and trying his best for the team. ""He is very important. It is true that in the last couple of years maybe he lacked this consistency of playing.¬† ""He had a couple of injuries and maybe when he wasn‚Äôt at the best moment he had an injury.

De Jong would sign 'six-year' extension to stay with Barcelona if offered,"Frenkie de Jong says he would pen a six-year extension with Barcelona if the club proposed, stressing that he is loving his time at Camp Nou. The midfielder arrived from Ajax in 2019 and has gone on to become an established fixture with the Blaugrana over the past three seasons, albeit without the silverware dominance hoped for upon his arrival. But the Netherlands international is unbothered by the lack of trophies to date and, amid reported interest from Bayern Munich, says that he wants to make his stay in La Liga a long-term one. ‚ÄúI love being at Barcelona,"" the Dutchman told ZiggoSport when asked about his future.

Ajax's Tadic 'will always be there' for disgraced Overmars despite harassment allegations,"Ajax star Dusan Tadic has insisted that he ""will always be there"" for the club's disgraced former director of football Marc Overmars despite the harassment allegations against him. After almost a decade of service in the boardroom, Overmars left Ajax in February after several female colleagues complained that he had sent them inappropriate messages. The club admitted that the 48-year-old, who had signed a new contract shortly before the allegations came to light, had ""gone over the line"" and couldn't continue to work at Johan Cruyff ArenA. Overmars released a statement apologising for his actions after leaving the club, which read: ""I am ashamed. I apologise. Certainly, for someone in my position, this behaviour is unacceptable. I now see that too. But it is too late. I see no other option but to leave Ajax. ""This also has a major impact on my private situation. That is why I ask everyone to leave me and my family alone."" Tadic has now come out to express support towards Overmars and reassure him that his opinion of him hasn't changed. ""He will always be my friend and I will always be there for him,"" the Serbia international has told Dutch outlet NOS.¬†""Playing for Ajax has always been a dream for me and because of him, that dream came true.  ""That's why he will always be special to me."" Asked if he has anything to say to the women that came forward to report Overmars, the club or the fans, Tadic replied: ""I have nothing to say, nothing special. I don't know what happened. I don't care either. Whether someone made a mistake or not... I don't want to judge anyone.  ""I don't want to say anything about that, because I don't know what happened. I support him as a friend and as a person who has meant a lot to Ajax. ""Everyone makes mistakes. It's not up to us to judge others."" The 33-year-old added on Overmars' current state of mind: ""He's doing better now. He's had a hard time. I hope he comes back big, because he really deserves that.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ajax-s-tadic-will-always-be-there-for-disgraced-overmars-despite-/blt4fe14f2e5e4a847b,James Westwood,2249c0a1-a8d8-4f24-bc3c-d6061c346fea
"Man City pre-season 2022-23: Tour, fixtures, results, tickets & everything you need to know","Manchester City claimed another Premier League title in 2021-22, their fourth in the space of five memorable years, and will not want to give up that crown without a fight. Pep Guardiola will also want to see his side come back into contention for domestic cup prizes, while also bringing a long wait for Champions League glory to a close. The Blues will be bolstering their ranks as another transfer window swings open, with prolific Norwegian striker Erling Haaland already on his way, and GOAL is on hand to bring you all you need to know about City‚Äôs summer plans on the field.

In the first of two friendlies in the US, the Blues beat Mexican side Club America in Houston with goals from Kevin De Bruyne although Haaland was missing as he works his way back to full fitness.   The Premier League title holders then defeated German giants Bayern Munich at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, with Haaland scoring on his non-competitive debut.  Guardiola's side then returned to England for the annual Community Shield curtain-raiser on July 30 against Liverpool. Trent Alexander-Arnold opened the scoring for the Reds in the first half before Julian Alvarez sent in the equaliser with just 20 minutes left. Mohamed Salah restored the Reds' lead in the 83rd minute when he fired into the corner from a penalty and Darwin Nunez then added another the dying moments of the match. That contest will see them lock horns with FA Cup winners Liverpool once again, although the game will take place at the King Power Stadium in Leicester, not Wembley Stadium, due to the Women‚Äôs European Championship. City have also revealed that they will be taking in a charity game against Barcelona on August 24 at Camp Nou, with that contest helping to raise funds for former Blaugrana goalkeeper and coach Juan Carlos Unzue - who was diagnosed with ALS in 2020. üá∫üá∏ City in the States! üá∫üá∏The first stop on our pre-season trip will be the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas to take on Club Am√©rica on 20th July!

Dybala reveals one key question he asked Mourinho before Roma transfer,"Paulo Dybala has opened up on his reasoning for joining Roma on a free transfer this summer. The forward spent the past seven seasons at Juventus, where he won five Serie A titles, and he said he needed to sign with a team with high ambitions that matched his own to follow up his abundant success with the Bianconeri. After quizzing manager Jose Mourinho on the project at Stadio Olimpico, Dybala decided Roma was an appropriate fit. Mourinho led the squad to Europa Conference League silverware last term while finishing sixth in Serie A. ""The first thing I asked the coach was what we aim to win,"" Dybala explained to reporters. ""I like to win, him too.  ""Both Mourinho and the club have given me certainties, here there is great confidence and awareness. This is very important for to go forward and to pursue the objectives. I will try to give my best and bring my experience to continue winning."" The Argentina star added: ""I talked a lot with the director, with the coach and with the president, knowing how this team is being built, I didn't have many doubts."" The 28-year-old's contract was allowed to run after this past season, and once he became a free agent, there was no attempt to re-sign him. ""I think the [Juventus] director [Maurizio] Arrivabene was very clear, we had an agreement to sign in October and then the club asked us to wait,"" Dybala said. ""In March the company told us that I would not be part of the future project. It was not a problem. Financially, the club made another decision together with the coach. I said that if this was their choice, it wasn't a problem for me."" Still, Dybala's departure from Turin was emotional, as he bid a tearful goodbye to fans at the end of the campaign.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dybala-question-mourinho-roma-transfer/bltbd0a0b4b8a2fd867,Dan Bernstein,163b4a78-88f9-4cda-9d4c-bb9bc47fbac7
From Hegerberg's impact to Bayern's spirit: What we learned from the Women‚Äôs Champions League,"Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Wolfsburg and Lyon were confirmed as the final four in the 2021-22 UEFA Women‚Äôs Champions League this week, after the completion of the second legs of this season‚Äôs quarter-finals. A world-record attendance for a women‚Äôs game watched the first game on offer, 91,553 turning up at Camp Nou and being treated to a thrilling Clasico. That spectacle would be a tough act to follow, but Thursday‚Äôs action didn‚Äôt disappoint, with plenty of drama as the last of the semi-finalists were revealed. Here are some of the things we learned in the process... After an exciting 5-2 win for Barca on Wednesday, the recipient of the Player of the Match trophy would be the same talented winger as last week, when the Catalans beat Real Madrid 3-1 in the first leg. Caroline Graham Hansen has been one of the game‚Äôs best players for a few years now ‚Äì last year, one could make a strong case for only her Ballon d‚ÄôOr-winning team-mate, Alexia Putellas, having had a better season. Yet, as Putellas collected that award, the Norway international's name wasn‚Äôt even nominated. Directes als llibres d'hist√≤ria pic.twitter.com/YuKLYMsF8N That she continues to be omitted from the shortlists for these individual prizes doesn‚Äôt bother her in terms of searching for personal glory ‚Äì not while she is winning trophy after trophy with her team. However, it continues to be unjust that the best wide player in world football is not often recognised as so. After working so hard to pull a goal back late on in a disappointing defeat in their home leg against Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich‚Äôs chances of getting the victory they needed in France were dealt an almighty set-back before the second leg even kicked off. The German club were missing seven players because of Covid-19. Their bench was bare ‚Äì two of their four substitutes were goalkeepers, all were under the age of 19 and only two had played for the first team before ‚Äì for a combined total of 36 minutes. Lyon vs PSGBarcelona vs WolfsburgThe Women's Champions League semi-finals are here üçø pic.twitter.com/HrLZmrKGD9 The performance Bayern put on, then, was incredible. They were 2-1 winners on the night in Paris, taking the tie to extra time. It‚Äôs the first time PSG has lost at home in 90 minutes since March of last year, to French rivals Lyon. It was also the first time a team other than Lyon had managed that since Wolfsburg, seven years ago. The lack of fresh legs would inevitably hurt them, with PSG substitute Ramona Bachmann winning the tie for her team, but what Bayern did was truly impressive. With the spirit and talent they have, mixed with the club's ambition, there is exciting potential in this team. As Wolfsburg beat Arsenal on Thursday, Svenja Huth ran the show. She‚Äôs been one of the most consistent performers at the top level over the last few years, but to watch her perform like that also reminds one of how her talent isn‚Äôt talked about anywhere near as much as it should be. As a German player, she‚Äôs not alone in that sense. There were no players from or based in the country on the Ballon d‚ÄôOr shortlist last year, despite Bayern dethroning Wolfsburg domestically and reaching the Champions League semi-finals. In 2018, after Wolfsburg had reached the final in Europe, only losing to Lyon after extra time, only one of their players was nominated. Jill Roord's goal against her former side helped Wolfsburg advance to the Women's Champions League semi-final üëÄ pic.twitter.com/fPz5YkEUzI This season, German teams have flexed their muscles in Europe ‚Äì Hoffenheim hammering Arsenal, Wolfsburg doing the same to Chelsea and Bayern beating Lyon. With teams like Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt growing and investing, it‚Äôs a league with a bright future, too. Sadly, it‚Äôs a league that isn‚Äôt so widely broadcasted, though. That is likely a large part of why it flies under the radar and it‚Äôs a shame, because there are so many players and teams that deserve to be showered in more praise. When Lyon endured their first trophyless campaign in 15 years last season, it was down to many reasons. Ada Hegerberg‚Äôs absence was one of them. The first ever Ballon d‚ÄôOr Feminin winner made her return to action back in October, after 21 months out injured, and has already scored 12 goals since ‚Äì including the opener on Thursday night as the French club overturned a 2-1 deficit in the second leg of their quarter-final against Juventus. She‚Äôs one of the world‚Äôs best but it‚Äôs not just on the pitch that she galvanises this team. Speaking to GOAL after ranking at No.6 in this year‚Äôs NXGN list, Lyon‚Äôs teenage defender Alice Sombath explained how the Norwegian brings ‚Äújoy‚Äù to the dressing room with her character, too. After last year‚Äôs disappointments, the seven-time European champions are into the semi-finals again and in pole position to reclaim their league title. New head coach Sonia Bompastor is a big reason why they‚Äôre getting back to their best, but Hegerberg‚Äôs impact certainly shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked either.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/hegerberg-impact-bayern-spirit-women-champions-league/blt6861317fe5e2eddd,Ame√© Ruszkai,68e2f09d-76f1-4094-8c50-c14b58244018
'My final decision' - Ziyech rules out Morocco return as Chelsea star confirms international retirement at 28,"Chelsea star Hakim Ziyech says he will not return to the Morocco national team amid an ongoing war of words with head coach Vahid Halilhodzic. Ziyech was excluded from Morocco's Afcon squad and, after their elimination, Halilhodzic said Ziyech would not be welcomed back into the team ""even if his name was Lionel Messi"". And the Chelsea star has now responded, hitting back by accusing the coach of ""lying"" while agreeing that he will not return to play for his country. ""I understand them, but I will not return to the Moroccan national team and this is my final decision,"" Ziyech told ADSportsTV.  ""It's all clear for me how things are going over there and I am focusing on what I am doing and, right now, that is my club. ""At the end of the day, it's a decision he makes and you have to respect it. All the lying that comes with it, it's, for me, clear and I will not return to the national team.  ""I understand and feel sorry for [the fans], but that's the situation we're in."" The last time Ziyech played for Morocco was last June in a friendly against Burkina Faso, with that match being the starting point of his feud with the national team's coach. After the Burkina Faso friendly, Halilhodzic said: ""His behaviour in the last two matches, especially the last one, was not that of a national team player who, as a leader in the team, must be a positive role model. ‚ÄúHe arrived late and after that, he even refused to work. There was no point in discussing it afterwards, as a coach the answer is right there to see."" Halilhodzic doubled down on that assessment last week, saying Ziyech's behaviour on national team duty ""does not fit the selection"". ""He doesn't want to train, doesn't want to play,"" he said of Ziyech. ""He doesn't take it seriously. I'm not going to beg him to come back. ""After the [Afcon] tournament three years ago, he was the most criticised. He was booed. You mustn't forget that."" Ziyech, who has earned 40 caps while scoring 17 goals, has featured 25 times for Chelsea this season, scoring six times.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/my-final-decision-ziyech-rules-out-morocco-return-as-chelsea/bltb5b0a42c959b6f55,Ryan Tolmich,ebd9f5a9-9296-44c7-a0a6-d855c450feec
FIFA reports reveals half of Euro & AFCON finalists suffered online abuse,"A new FIFA report has revealed that more than half of the players who participated in the last European Championship and Africa Cup of Nations finals suffered from discriminatory online abuse.  Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were subjected to a torrent of abuse last summer after missing their penalties during England's defeat to Italy.  But the trio were far from alone, pointing to a real issue in the game over the use of social media to target footballers.  The report, carried out by Threat Matrix on FIFA's prompting, studied hundreds of thousands of posts published during the semi-final and final stages of the two continental competitions.  It found that over 55 per cent of players who participated in the final received some form of discriminatory abuse, with most of that traffic coming from users in their home nation.  Homophobic messages were the most common, with racism following.  The abuse was greater against the three black England players who missed their penalties, though overall an Egypt substitute was singled out for the greatest volume of offensive messaging.  The report also found differences between social media platforms, with abuse on Twitter more constant across the finals while on Instagram proved more driven by events, for example in the immediate aftermath of England's defeat. ""Our duty is to protect football and that starts with the players who bring so much joy and happiness to all of us by their exploits on the field of play,"" FIFA President Gianni Infantino signalled in a statement on Saturday. ""Unfortunately, there is a trend developing where a percentage of posts on social media channels directed towards players, coaches, match officials and the teams themselves is not acceptable, and this form of discrimination - like any form of discrimination - has no place in football.""

"Klinsmann gives his USMNT verdict, why he feels sad for John Brooks & his key advice for Pepi","As the U.S. men's national team moves closer to a World Cup, the man that last led them to soccer's biggest tournament is still watching on. Jurgen Klinsmann, former manager of the USMNT, still keeps a close eye on the team he used to coach. Klinsmann managed the USMNT from 2011-16, with the U.S. reaching the Round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup during his tenure. He was dismissed midway through the now-infamous failed 2018 World Cup qualifying cycle but, in the years since, has kept a close eye on the USMNT as a new generation of stars look ahead to this year's World Cup in Qatar. Under Klinsmann, the USMNT reached the knockout stages of the 2014 World Cup, escaping from a Group of Death that included Portugal, Germany and Ghana. And, as the U.S. prepare to face England, Wales and Iran in Qatar this winter, he believes this group should have that expectation - reach the knockout rounds and see what they can do. ""It's very exciting times for U.S. Soccer, for the national team, because we never had players playing for Champions League teams in Europe. So automatically, if you have a Christian [Pulisic], if you have a [Weston] McKennie, [Tyler] Adams, Sergino Dest, for example, players that compete at the highest European competitions, then the expectations automatically rise as well.  ""It's a must to get out of the group. That's a must and anything else that comes afterwards depends on who you meet. But it also depends a lot on the hunger of this group of players. Where do you want to take yourself? What do you want to achieve at the end of the day in your own career?  ""There are those moments in a World Cup where you have to go beyond your 100 percent and really stretch it to the extreme and, if you do that, the group has a great spirit, a good camaraderie, which I expect, then you can take it from one game to the next in the knockout phase.  ""But the minimum, absolute minimum is obviously is getting out of that group. USMNT defender John Brooks became a regular during Klinsmann's tenure, famously scoring that late winner against Ghana during the team's last appearance at the World Cup. He'd been a mainstay for the USMNT in the years since until being dropped by Gregg Berhalter in the early games of World Cup qualifying. Berhalter spoke about Brooks' absence earlier this week, saying that he wanted a look at more unproven commodities while adding that Brooks may not be a natural fit for the USMNT's style of play. However, Berhalter did also say that Brooks, who is currently a free agent, could play his way back into the team  ""To me, it's a question of: Let's see where John ends up,"" Berhalter told ESPN. ""Let's see what club he ends up at and let's see how his form is throughout the fall. And then we can evaluate."" Klinsmann, one of Berhalter's  predecessors, understands the difficulties of making decisions on the international level, although he does sympathize with Brooks as he still speaks highly of the veteran defender. ""I have always been full of compliments for John Brooks because he's a great character, is a very good professional, and he proved his qualities over so many years,"" Klinsmann said. ""But at the end of the day, you have a choice as a national team coach. You have your own ideas and you want to make it fit your own way. So I understand Gregg.  ""I'm sad for John because I think he's a very, very good centerback and especially his experience that he has in the international game is outstanding...He has¬†tremendous experience. But again, it's Gregg's decisions, and John has to respect that.  ""But I hope for him that he's not totally forgotten. Who knows? One, two injuries and suddenly he's back in the picture and suddenly he's flying to Doha and we see him there."" As the World Cup draws closer, Berhalter will have some difficult decisons to make when it comes to selecting his roster.  Klinsmann says that, in his experience, Berhalter will have 90 percent of his roster locked in, with that last 10 percent depending on form in the weeks leading up to the tournament. One such player that could seal a spot is Malik Tillman, who completed his switch to the USMNT this summer after nearing a breakthrough at Bayern Munich. Tillman's case reminded many of Julian Green who, during Klinsmann's tenure, joined the USMNT while at Bayern and went on to play at the World Cup. However, in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup, Tillman has moved to Rangers, which Klinsmann believes will be a fantastic home for the young star. ""You just wish every extremely talented player like Tillman, like how it was with Julian [Green] years ago, did get the chance to prove themselves in the club environment,"" Klinsmann says.  ""Tillman's move to Rangers is a big move because it's not only getting playing time right away, it's also a very strong league, especially physically. It's a battlefield, Scotland and then he has the opportunity to play in European cup competitions as well.  ""Rangers? It's a big deal. It's a real big deal. So if he gets a flow of games, if he gets consistency in his performances, it's a very fast learning curve and it's growing opportunity for him. That would benefit him enormously, enormously towards Qatar, so I think it's a pretty cool situation for him."" One player that Klinsmann has kept a close eye on is Ricardo Pepi, who has yet to score for Augsburg after moving to the club from FC Dallas in January. Pepi's struggles have seen him fall down the pecking order in the race to be the USMNT's No. 9, with former teammate Jesus Ferreira now likely atop the depth chart. But, after a summer of adjusting to his new surroundings, Klinsmann believes Pepi is better-equipped for what's to come. ""As a striker especially, you want to score goals week in and week out,"" he said. ""But all he needs to do is really just keep pushing, keep working hard, keep convincing your new coaching staff that you deserve to play from the beginning on and then step by step gain more confidence in your game. Hopefully, they give him more chances to score.  ""He knew that going to Augsburg will be very difficult for a striker because it's not like how [Robert] Lewandowski can go into the game and say, 'I'll get four or five chances and,¬†and three of the five, I put them away'. He has a lot of games he didn't get any chance to score! It's¬†a team that usually, traditionally, fights relegation.  ""It's very difficult for a striker to make a good impression, to get your goals, and that's kind of your business card, the amount of goals. It's your card that you play towards your national team coach telling him 'Hey, I'm there, I'm doing well!'. So I hope that he gets more chances to score, but it's about keeping on learning and keep on fighting and go through that period.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/klinsmann-gives-usmnt-verdict-sad-for-john-brooks-advice-for/bltdc2bcb032ec14fac,Ryan Tolmich,2a5d552e-4d76-45a2-9634-72ba4fb2637a
"Managing Chelsea is my dream, says Blues icon Terry","Former Chelsea star John Terry says it is his dream to become the club's manager.

"Ronaldo victim of 'false narrative' and not to blame for Man Utd poor form, says Shearer","Cristiano Ronaldo is the victim of a ""false narrative"" and not to blame for Manchester United's poor form, according to the Premier League's all-time record goalscorer Alan Shearer. United spent ¬£20 million ($27m) to re-sign Ronaldo from Juventus last August, 12 years on from his initial departure to Real Madrid. The Portuguese earned club legend status in his first spell at Old Trafford, winning three Premier League titles and the Champions League, but has faced far more criticism this time around with the Red Devils no longer the force of old. Ronaldo has been powerless to prevent United from slipping to fifth in the Premier League after 24 matches of the 2021-22 season or from suffering early exits in both the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. The 37-year-old's body language after bad results has been called into question too, with it suggested that his negative attitude is rubbing off on the rest of the squad, but Shearer has jumped to his defence. ""I don‚Äôt blame Ronaldo for anything that‚Äôs going on there,"" the former Newcastle and England forward told The Athletic. ""He has every right to believe that if it wasn‚Äôt for him then they‚Äôd be far worse off than they are.  ""He would be correct.¬†Ronaldo must be thinking, 'what have I walked into‚Ä¶'  ""He is an unbelievable player ‚Äî one of the greatest to have ever strode the planet ‚Äî but he is also 37.  ""He rails against being left out or being taken off because the very essence of his make-up is an unparalleled will to win and a determination never to be beaten.  ""He wants to play every single minute of every match. Once that attitude goes, Ronaldo goes. But, of course, it also puts pressure on the manager."" Shearer added: ""Should he be more graceful at the end of matches, encouraging his team-mates?  ""Having Ronaldo at the club should be a dream for younger players and if they‚Äôre not asking him advice and soaking it all up, then they bloody well should be.  ""For me, it‚Äôs a false narrative.

"Man Utd or Bayern transfer for De Jong unlikely due to the 'bad weather', claims Barcelona star's father","Frenkie de Jong is unlikely to move to Manchester United or Bayern Munich due to the 'bad weather', but the Barcelona midfielder's father says five of Europe's leading clubs have enquired about signing him. The Netherlands international has faced criticism this season for his performances with the Camp Nou side as they continue to struggle in La Liga and were recently eliminated from the Champions League. De Jong, 24, has been highlighted by the Spanish media as one player who could be sold to help solve the club‚Äôs financial crisis and his father says there is a lot of interest in him. However, John de Jong insisted to Algemeen Dagblad that a move to United or Munich may not appeal to the ex-Ajax star, saying: ""It's often bad weather there. Of course it's about football, but it does matter. ‚ÄúOf course, I know that Barcelona needs money and a great offer for Frenkie could help, but I don't see it happening anytime soon. Although, five top European clubs have all called.‚Äù De Jong remains a mainstay in the Barca starting XI, having made 19 appearances in all competitions this season. He has scored one goal and made two assists so far this term for Xavi‚Äôs side, who sit eighth in La Liga and 18 points behind leaders Real Madrid.

Gabriel Vidovic: Bayern Munich wonderkid on verge of debut after impressing Nagelsmann,"Despite all their success, for over a decade Bayern Munich fans have been longing for a homegrown player to emerge and put their stamp on the first team. Not since Thomas Muller and David Alaba made their breakthroughs in the late 2000s has a true Bayern academy graduate made the grade at the Allianz Arena. Jamal Musiala is, of course, continuing to make waves at the Bundesliga champions, but the 19-year-old was only with the club for a year before being called up to the senior squad, with most of his footballing education coming at Chelsea. There are signs, however, that some talented teenagers are about to start making their mark as Julian Nagelsmann oversees a changing of the guard over the next few seasons. Sixteen-year-old Paul Wanner has already become the youngest player in the club's history after debuting in January, and he is not the only youngster who is now training regularly under Nagelsmann's watch. Gabriel Vidovic may still be waiting for his first-team bow, but fans were thrilled to see the forward sign a new two-year contract extension in February, such is the potential he has shown over the course of the 2021-22 season. A member of the Bayern youth system since joining their Under-14s, the 18-year-old was named in Nagelsmann's matchday squad for the first time against Red Bull Salzburg in the last 16 of the Champions League, and is being tipped for a bright future. ""Gabriel Vidovic is a player who is technically very talented and creates a great goal threat from the gaps,"" Bayern sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, said after Vidovic committed himself to the club until 2025. ""He has been with us for six years, received excellent training at the FC Bayern Campus, and should take the next step with our pros."" Bayern's drive for Vidovic to make it to the top of the European game is unsurprising given the lengths they had to take to convince the youngster's family to enrol him into their age-group sides. Check out football's best wonderkids with NXGN: Vidovic's father, Zoran, acted as his son's first coach in the Bavarian city of Augsburg, and it is GOAL and SPOX's understanding that he turned down Bayern's initial approach in 2009 to begin giving his son more formal coaching. It was not until three years later that Zoran, who emigrated to Germany from Croatia in the 1990s, eventually relented when Bayern again requested that Gabriel be integrated into their academy ranks, and after a few years of training, he was officially signed on in 2016. ‚ÄúGabi comes from a good family. He is well brought up and polite, and also brings a certain humility with him, without lacking in self-confidence, ‚Äù Jochen Sauer, who coached Vidovic for five years at Bayern, explains to GOAL and SPOX. ""He is a good footballer who has been constantly developing. Physically, he was usually one of the youngest in his year, which means he learned early on to assert himself against physically stronger opponents."" Vidovic, no doubt, took inspiration from his idols Lionel Messi and Luka Modric when faced with imposing defenders, and it also stood him in good stead for when he was first invited to take part in first-team training during pre-season in 2021. Though he impressed Nagelsmann, competition for attacking places at Bayern is such that he was placed in the reserve-team squad, who play matches in the fourth tier of German football. Vidovic has thrived, however, scoring 12 goals and laying on seven assists in 20 league matches, leading to Nagelsmann considering him for a permanent promotion to the senior side. That promotion might have come in December, when he was set to be called up to sit on the bench for Der Klassiker against Borussia Dortmund, only for a thigh injury to rule him out of action. Able to play either as an attacking midfielder or a central striker, Vidovic's dribbling and shooting are what catches the eye initially when watching him in action. ‚ÄúGabi has excellent technique and a high level of game intelligence,"" Sauer says. ""He always makes surprising moves for the opponent with the ball. ""He is also very efficient and dangerous when either scoring himself, or creating dangerous situations and setting up goals. All of these skills have distinguished him so far this season.‚Äù Those attributes, combined with his attacking output this season, meant that a number of clubs from both the Bundesliga and the 2. Bundesliga showed an interest in signing Vidovic as his contract entered its final 18 months around the turn of the year, while even Barcelona were cited as showing an interest before his future was finally settled. ""I'm very happy about the trust the club has placed in me and I would like to thank everyone at Bayern who has supported me so far,"" the Croatia U21 international said upon signing his new deal. ""I know that this was only a small step, but I will do everything to be able to play for Bayern for a long time to come."" That is a promise one Bayern legend hopes Vidovic can keep. ""It is a big leap from the fourth tier to the Bundesliga, but the club need to set an example that the pathway is there,"" ex-Germany and Bayern captain, Lothar Matthaus, tells GOAL and SPOX. ""Vidovic is a player who can make that step, and then start producing at the top level.‚Äù If he does so, then Bayern's long wait for a homegrown superstar might be about to end.

Firmino responds to Liverpool transfer talk & links to Serie A giants Juventus,"Roberto Firmino continues to generate exit talk at Liverpool, with Serie A giants Juventus said to be keen on acquiring his services, but the Brazil international says his intention is ‚Äúto stay‚Äù at Anfield. The 30-year-old frontman is into the final year of his contract with Premier League heavyweights and has seen the likes of Darwin Nunez drafted in to eventually fill his boots. No extension to his terms on Merseyside have been discussed, meaning that he could hit free agency in the summer of 2023, but the South American insists he is not pushing for a move and would be happy to spend the new campaign prolonging his association with the Reds. Firmino has been on Liverpool‚Äôs books since 2015, with 328 appearances taken in across seven years. He has 98 goals to his name, leaving him just a couple short of a century, and intends to stick around at a club that has allowed him to claim Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Club World Cup winners‚Äô medals. A proven performer has told TNT Sports of his future plans: ‚ÄúI love this team, this city and the fans. I'm here. I want to stay of course.‚Äù Roberto Firmino found a celebration and he's sticking to it üï∫ pic.twitter.com/fE7TWzJlsY The Reds may have been tempted to cash in on Firmino while they still can, especially after investing in Nunez as another No.9 to lead their line, but Jurgen Klopp has stated that he intends to keep an experienced figure in his plans. The German tactician has said when asked about the Firmino transfer rumours: ‚ÄúBobby is crucial for us, the heart and soul of this team, the way we played in the last years was only possible because of Bobby. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm really happy he was able to train for the majority of the time here in pre-season so far. Everything looks really good so I am absolutely fine. ‚ÄúThere is no doubt about Bobby‚Äôs quality.

Neville loving life in America as ex-England boss eyes long Inter Miami stay,"Phil Neville says that he is loving life in Florida as head coach of Inter Miami, with the former England women boss admitting that he hopes for ""longevity"" in his position at the MLS expansion outfit. The former Manchester United defender linked up with the Fort Lauderdale-based outfit - part-owned by onetime Class of 92 team-mate David Beckham - last term, and guided them to an 11th place Eastern Conference finish in his first year in charge. Yet the ex-Lionesses supremo has no plans to go anywhere in the future and says that he has aspirations to help build the club's fortunes over the coming years, stressing that he and his family have gone all in on embracing their life stateside. ‚ÄúWe are committed, we don‚Äôt go half measures,‚Äù said Neville, at a launch event for the new MLS season. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got no house or property in England, there‚Äôs nothing to come home for apart from family. ‚ÄúWe love living in the US and we as a family, and me personally, want this to be a success.

I want to be successful and I want to repay the faith that David and (co-owner) Jose (Mas) have put in me.‚Äù Despite several glowing signings and high hopes for quick success, Miami have arguably underperformed against expectations over their first two campaigns in MLS, and Neville is aware that their is ground to be covered. ‚ÄúWe had to send a strong strong statement because the first two years for this franchise weren‚Äôt good enough, weren‚Äôt acceptable from the top down to the very bottom,‚Äù the 45-year-old added. ‚ÄúSo we had to make major changes to get what we wanted.

"Liverpool can 'definitely' compete with Real Madrid, Man City and PSG for Haaland, claims Johnson","Erling Haaland may be taking in a long goodbye at Borussia Dortmund, and Glen Johnson believes Liverpool can ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù compete with Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain for the superstar striker. The prolific Norway international's stock has soared during a goal-laden spell in the Bundesliga, scoring 76 goals in two years, and it is considered to be only a matter of time before he bids farewell to BVB. Various landing spots are being mooted for the 21-year-old, with suggestions Liverpool may look to join the hunt and Jurgen Klopp is being encouraged to enter into transfer talks with his former club. Quizzed on whether Liverpool can compete with big-spending Madrid, Man City and PSG for the most-coveted of signatures, former Reds defender Johnson ‚Äì speaking in association with BoyleSports ‚Äì told GOAL: ‚ÄúIn terms of the stature of the club, definitely, but they do business totally differently. ""We all know that Liverpool sign players with an awful lot of stats involved and they have certain salaries that they will and won‚Äôt pay, whereas Real Madrid and PSG will pretty much do whatever they want. ‚ÄúOf course it is going to be hard to compete on that level, but the top players have got their heads screwed on and hopefully they don‚Äôt just follow the big contracts. ""Wherever they go, they are going to be very well paid so they have to be patient and pick the right club, rather than being attracted by big numbers.‚Äù Klopp is not expected to be busy during the January window, but further funds may be invested during the summer. Liverpool found value when landing Virgil van Dijk and Alisson in previous windows, so who could they turn to next? Johnson said: ‚ÄúI like Raphinha. I think it‚Äôs a realistic signing as well. Everyone talks about the Mbappes, but those deals aren‚Äôt easy to get over the line. I think someone like Raphinha could easily work. ""Obviously the big one is Haaland. Everyone knows that if Liverpool‚Äôs front three don‚Äôt score, they usually struggle. They definitely need some more firepower up there. The kid looks special as well.‚Äù If a raid on Dortmund is lined up for Haaland, Liverpool could ask questions of his club colleague Jude Bellingham. Johnson added, with the Reds being linked with the 18-year-old England international midfielder: ‚ÄúIf you got a chance to sign him, then you have got to do it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there is any one position at Liverpool that is a major weakness, but these top players don‚Äôt come around often and doors to sign them might only open once. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of Jude Bellingham. Do they need him right now? Probably not. Would he be an unbelievable player for them in the next eight years? Definitely.‚Äù Liverpool may end up finding the funds for Haaland and/or Bellingham, but a raid on domestic rivals Leeds for Raphinha could prove easier to pull off as the Brazilian winger is already in English football. Pressed on whether the South American would also be happier filling a squad role on Merseyside, Johnson said: ‚ÄúI think [Haaland and Bellingham] would be open to it because they are joining a mega club to win mega trophies and they are super young. ""I don‚Äôt think they would be banging the door down to say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm starting every single week‚Äô. They are used to playing every week and know they will bring some special stuff, but sometimes you have to be patient. ‚ÄúWith Raphinha, he would be going to a top club, playing with world-class players, and it would be a step up for him.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/liverpool-real-madrid-man-city-psg-haaland-johnson/blte3754a8e4a1ad8ea,Chris Burton,aaab3a54-9679-4cec-a335-c8dd2d84011d
Lampard set to be named Everton manager,"Frank Lampard is set to be named Everton manager, GOAL can confirm. The former Chelsea boss has beaten Duncan Ferguson and Vitor Perreira to the job after a series of interviews on Friday in London. Lampard is expected to try and bring along members of his coaching staff from Chelsea as he returns to management one year after departing the Blues. Everton's managerial position has been open since the club dismissed Rafa Benitez on January 16, ending his stint after just six-and-a-half months. Club legend Duncan Ferguson took over on an interim basis for the second time, losing 1-0 to Aston Villa in his only game in charge. Former Everton star Wayne Rooney had been heavily linked to the role, but the Derby County boss admitted that he turned down the club's approach to focus on his current job. ‚ÄúEverton approached my agent and asked me to interview for the job,"" he said. ‚ÄúBut I turned it down. I believe I will be a Premier League manager and I am ready for that 100 per cent. But I have a job at Derby, which is important to me."" Like Rooney, Lampard also began his coaching career at Derby, managing the club in 2018-19. He was then appointed by his longtime club Chelsea, making him the first English manager of the club in two decades. Lampard guided the Blues to a fourth-place finish and the FA Cup final in his first season. However, after a poor run of results, Lampard was dismissed in 2021 as Chelsea went on to win the Champions League under Thomas Tuchel.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lampard-set-to-be-named-everton-manager/blt48c17a8babeb7e39,Nizaar Kinsella,2fcf5450-991b-49ca-acb0-2635eefa2643
"Sergio Ramos 'deserves respect' after being whistled by PSG fans, says Pochettino","Mauricio Pochettino has insisted Sergio Ramos deserves more ""respect"" after the Paris Saint-Germain star was whistled by a section of supporters at Parc des Princes. Ramos joined PSG on a free transfer after bringing his 16-year career at Real Madrid to an end last summer, but his first season in France has been blighted by injury problems. The 36-year-old returned from his latest problems to make a cameo appearance against Lorient on Sunday, but wasn't given a warm reception by the home fans. Pochettino brought Ramos on for the final 18 minutes of PSG's 5-1 win, which marked only his sixth appearance in all competitions for the club. Ramos was booed by supporters as he made his way onto the pitch, much to the disgust of Pochettino, who thinks that the PSG faithful are still venting their frustrations over the club's early Champions League exit. ""The whistles for Sergio Ramos? We're all affected, I think it's the fans' frustration for the Champions League result, I don't think it's directed at him,"" the PSG boss told a post-match press conference.  ""He's a great champion, he deserves respect like all PSG players."" Pochettino has been under pressure since PSG's Champions League defeat to Real Madrid, with suggestions he could be sacked before the end of the season. The Argentine has also been strongly linked with the top job at Manchester United, and admits he is not sure whether he will see out his contract at Parc des Princes. ""If it is possible to stay at PSG next season? For the moment, I am not discussing my future with the leaders of the club,"" Pochettino told¬†Foot Mercato.

Koeman: Barcelona haven't improved their standing under Xavi,"Ronald Koeman has defended his tenure as Barcelona coach, saying he never received adequate support from the board and suggested they are not better off with his successor, Xavi. Koeman was dismissed in October after less than 18 months in charge with the club ninth in La Liga and six points behind leaders Real Madrid. Xavi was confirmed as his replacement the following month and has lifted the club up to second in the table, though they are currently 15 points behind rivals Real Madrid, who could clinch the title this weekend. Koeman could only guide Barca to a third-place finish in his only full season in charge before being dismissed after picking up just 15 points from the first 10 games of the 2021-22 campaign. His time at the club was overshadowed by the club‚Äôs financial problems, which restricted their activity in the transfer market and ultimately led to the departure of Lionel Messi last summer. There was also the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic which forced many matches behind closed doors and the return of Joan Laporta as president. ""I can write a book [about my time at Barca]. Many things happened to us,‚Äù Koeman told a news conference. ‚ÄúCovid issue, lack of president for a while, I had to answer all kinds of questions, not being able to sign the players we wanted, [financial] fair play complications, without Leo Messi from one day to another, losing [Antoine] Griezmann on the last day of the market.‚Äù Koeman was keen to stress his support for Xavi when asked about the impact his successor has had at Camp Nou, though he did point out the larger gap between themselves and champions-elect Real Madrid. ‚ÄúSure, they have improved in some things. They have signed three strikers or three players who can play up front,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is not good to compare. When I left, Barcelona was eight points away and now almost double. It is not good to compare. ‚ÄúXavi's task It's just as complicated as me. This is the reality of Barcelona today. It needs time to return to what it was and, therefore, I ask for peace of mind and not to think that we haven't won titles. We have to think long-term, trust and support the coach.‚Äù Koeman was critical of Barca president Laporta, who he believes did not offer him enough support, particularly when publicly questioning his future last summer. ‚ÄúIt's true that Barca's situation is the same as it was with me. That means that changing a coach is not always something that guarantees you to improve,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don't want to make any criticism. The only thing I ask is to support Xavi. A coach is not the only culprit. I didn‚Äôt have the full support of the president and I hope he has learned from this and supports Xavi.  ""The club's situation hurts me, it's sad because I'm a cule. I ask for maximum support for Xavi, he's a legend, a very good coach and little to blame for Barcelona being in this situation"". Asked about his relationship with Laporta, Koeman said: ‚ÄúI have not spoken much out of respect for the club. It is not good that I have to answer questions of this kind every time. ‚ÄúI have felt, in other clubs, especially in two years as a coach, that we know exactly the risk of being a coach: If things don't work as the club thinks, they can kick you out. ‚ÄúBut, for me, the president left doubts. Off the record [he] said ‚ÄòI don't know if he continues, we have doubts. It's not good‚Äô. ""We have to speak clearly in private, but defend the coach in public.

Ronaldo bet ‚Äò‚Ç¨100 or a bottle of wine‚Äô on training drills at Juventus as Khedira discusses Man Utd star‚Äôs changing ego,"Sami Khedira has revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo would bet ‚Äò‚Ç¨100 or a bottle of wine‚Äô on training drills at Juventus, with the current Manchester United superstar eager to emerge victorious in every challenge he undertakes. On the field, that determination to succeed has delivered countless trophies and records, with a standing among the all-time greats allowing the Portuguese icon to collect five Ballons d‚ÄôOr. The 37-year-old striker is, however, just as competitive off the pitch as he is on it and would often make wagers with team-mates during his time in Italy when it came to shooting practice and small-sided games. German midfielder Khedira, who played with Ronaldo at Real Madrid and Juventus, told The Gabs & Juls Show of the changes he witnessed in a legendary figure: ‚ÄúI met two Cristianos. The first was at Real Madrid. He was a bit young, a bit more insecure and selfish, too. ‚ÄúNot selfish in a bad way, just in the way young strikers are. He had to find his personality. And then the second Cristiano, after he moved to Juventus ‚Ä¶ he was much more of a leader. ‚ÄúStill driven by ego and selfishness to score, but more about pushing his team-mates, helping them be better. Off the pitch, he was much more relaxed and much more mature, but on the pitch, always focused and just as intense. ‚ÄúWe saw it on the first day, taking shots on goal. He was so competitive, whether it was that or playing 4-on-4; he‚Äôd want to bet on it, say ‚Ç¨100 or a bottle of wine. He‚Äôs a competitor and if he loses, he gets angry. So nobody wants to let him down.‚Äù Ronaldo‚Äôs relentless pursuit of perfection does tend to rub off on those around him, with United, Real Madrid and Juventus benefiting from his talismanic presence. Awestruck team-mates are inspired to try and scale similar heights, with individual gains allowing a collective group to prevail. Khedira was among those to buy into that mentality when operating alongside Ronaldo, with the 2014 World Cup winner adding on the most demanding of characters: ‚ÄúYou have to give Ronaldo the ball in the box, you have to transmit the idea that I will fight for [Cristiano], I will run for him, I will do everything for him. Because at the end, he probably will score the winning goal and get you the three points. That‚Äôs the compromise that you have with Cristiano.‚Äù Ronaldo has seen his influence called into question at times this season, following an emotional return to Old Trafford in the summer of 2021, but he has still recorded 15 goals across 30 appearances and has United in the hunt for Champions League glory alongside a top-four finish in the Premier League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/ronaldo-bet-100-bottle-of-wine-training-drills-juventus/blt2cad803c27137b9a,Chris Burton,81378133-09ba-485d-9df7-cabd6d420c6f
"Haaland hat-trick hero!

The Norwegian striker has dispelled those last, lingering concerns with a brilliant hat-trick as Manchester City completed a stunning turnaround at the Etihad Stadium.  For the fourth time in six Premier League matches, City found themselves two goals behind and staring down the barrel.  They haven't lost any of them, and for a second time they've turned that stark losing position into a victory.  Bernardo Silva's deflected strike brought them back into the game: then enter Haaland with a 19-minute hat-trick to secure the three points.  ""These games are why I'm here - to turn things around when there are difficult times,"" he said.",https://www.goal.com/en/lists/manchester-city-winners-losers-and-ratings-haaland-crashes/blta5d59b7cb183322e,Jonathan Smith,4f78b0c6-c3bf-45f2-9c13-7a55df446e84
"'I'd be disappointed if I was him' - PSG star Neymar should have won Ballon d'Or by now, says Aurelio","Neymar‚Äôs inability to ‚Äúmanage his life better‚Äù has cost him the Ballon d‚ÄôOr his talent deserves, according to former Liverpool defender Fabio Aurelio. The Paris Saint-Germain star is widely recognised as one of the most gifted players in world football, backed up by a glittering CV for club and country.  Yet despite winning honours in Paris and Barcelona, as well as with first club Santos, and despite closing in on Pele‚Äôs record of 77 goals for the Brazilian national team, Aurelio believes the 30-year-old is capable of even more. Speaking exclusively to GOAL, Aurelio said: ‚ÄúI always say that I would be very disappointed if I was him.  ‚ÄúThe ambitions he has, and for the quality and talent he has, the fact that he has never won a Ballon d‚ÄôOr feels wrong. He has all the conditions to do it, but I don‚Äôt know what has happened. Maybe some things are more important to him than the game, I don‚Äôt know? ‚ÄúYou see [Cristiano] Ronaldo, [Lionel] Messi, they were there at the top level for 10 or 15 years, and you never heard about problems away from the pitch, but Neymar is always involved in things like this.  ‚ÄúHe needs to stay away from those things, because he is capable of amazing things. Maybe now, the age he is, if you don‚Äôt look after yourself, it can come back and haunt you. ‚ÄúHe is still Neymar, and capable of doing things that you don‚Äôt expect, but you see now he is not as fit as he used to be.‚Äù Aurelio, who won two Liga titles with Valencia and made more than 100 appearances for Liverpool, now works as an agent, advising a number of up-and-coming prospects in Brazil. ‚ÄúWe focus a lot on younger players, and their dream is always to play in Europe,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI always say that in Europe, they prefer to have a 7/10 player and a 10/10 person, rather than the other way round.  I see Neymar like that, to be honest.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a top player, but he could do more. He could manage his life better, especially considering the influence he has on the next generation of Brazilian players.‚Äù If Brazil are to be successful at the World Cup in Qatar later this year, then Neymar is likely to be key. However with the emergence of a new generation of talent, such as Real Madrid wonderkids Vinicius Jr and Rodrgyo, Ajax prospect Antony, Atletico Madrid‚Äôs Mateus Cunha and Arsenal‚Äôs Gabriel Martinelli, head coach Tite will have no shortage of attacking firepower to choose from. Aurelio said: ‚ÄúThe new younger players in Brazil, they are so strong and they are adapting to the top level.  ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be easy to win the World Cup, but you always have to count Brazil as one of the favourites, even if they are not playing well. They have qualified easily, but that shouldn‚Äôt be given too much attention. I‚Äôve seen Brazil just about scrape in and then win the tournament, so it‚Äôs hard to judge!  ‚ÄúThey will be strong again. They are a solid team. Maybe they don‚Äôt play the beautiful football people expect, but they are a proper team.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-neymar-ballon-d-or-aurelio/blte0a3de1464fb391c,Neil Jones,26d5c60b-fc57-4e7c-98d0-fc917c2a21dd
Neymar & Messi lead the way as PSG populate entire top 10 list of highest Ligue 1 earners,"Neymar and Lionel Messi are leading the way in the top 10 list of highest Ligue 1 earners, which is populated entirely by Paris Saint-Germain players. PSG have been one of the richest clubs in world football since Qatar Sports Investments' successful takeover at Parc des Princes in 2011. Marquee signings have become a regular occurrence over the past decade and, after the additions of several more household names last summer, including Messi, L'Equipe reports that the squad is now worth a total of ‚Ç¨629 million (¬£525m/$692m). The French newspaper has also published a top 30 list of the highest salaries in Ligue 1 for 2021-22, with Brazilian forward Neymar out in front with gross monthly earnings of ‚Ç¨4m. Messi, who joined PSG on a free transfer after leaving Barcelona at the end of the 2020-21 campaign, comes in second on ‚Ç¨3.3m, over ‚Ç¨1m ahead of third-place Kylian Mbappe. Marquinhos and Marco Verratti are up next in fourth and fifth, while Achraf Hakimi, Keylor Navas, Angel Di Maria, Georginio Wijnaldum and Gianluigi Donnarumma fill the remaining spots in the top 10.

"Afcon 2021: Equatorial Guinea don‚Äôt have stars, ‚Äòour star is the team‚Äô ‚Äì Ganet","Equatorial Guinea midfielder Pablo Ganet believes a lack of star players in their squad has helped them to do well at the Africa Cup of Nations. Against all odds, the Nzalang Nacional continued with their fine run in the 33rd edition in Cameroon after they beat Mali 6-5 on penalties to reach the quarter-finals. Their victory against Les Aigles came after they had also caused an upset in the group stage, when they beat defending champions Algeria 1-0 at Douala Stadium. The 27-year-old Ganet, who features for Segunda Division RFEF club Real Murcia, feels their fairy tale run in Cameroon is a result of their squad not having big-name stars. ‚ÄúWe are a small country. We don‚Äôt have a star - our star is the team,‚Äù Ganet said as quoted by BBC Sport Africa.  ‚ÄúIf they respect us, ok. If they didn't respect us it is up to them, but we showed our value. We played with our heads. ‚ÄúI am so happy, I don't know in English how (to say) tears of emotion. I feel really happy, but not about me, but as a team, because we played as a team and it is in our power.‚Äù Ganet, who was named man of the match against Mali, explained their players, most of whom play domestically in Equatorial Guinea, have shown they can fight for positive results against the best players on the continent, as they did against Les Aigles. ‚ÄúIn the first half, I have to be honest, I think they played better,‚Äù Ganet continued. ‚ÄúBut step by step we got better and I think in extra time we played even better than them. I don't think they expected that and when they wanted to react it was too late. But Mali is a big team and in the future, they can go far.‚Äù Meanwhile, coach Juan Micha said after beating Mali: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs historic for us to get this far and it comes after excellent work by my players.‚Äù The Nzalang Nacional kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 defeat against Ivory Coast, beat the Desert Warriors 1-0, and then managed another 1-0 win against Sierra Leone in their final group fixture.

'Arnautovic is priceless!' - Man Utd told by Bologna director that target isn't for sale,"Manchester United's pursuit of Marko Arnautovic has already hit a stumbling block after Bologna chief Marco Di Vaio claimed that he has no intention of selling his star striker. The Red Devils have been heavily linked with the 33-year-old in the last few days as Erik ten Hag looks to rectify his lack of attacking options. Anthony Martial picked up an injury that has ruled him out for the start of the season while Cristiano Ronaldo continues to push for a move away from the club. Arnautovic, who previously played in the Premier League at Stoke City and West Ham, could provide crucial squad depth for Manchester United if he was made available for transfer. Speaking in response to speculation regarding Bologna's top goalscorer from last season, sporting director Di Vaio made his club's stance abundantly clear. ""It's not a question of money,"" he said to Mediaset. ""Marko is priceless for us for what he represents from a technical point of view, for what he represents for our club, we want to move forward with him, he can do better than last year and help us grow. ""There is a lot of talk about our players and we reiterate that we are convinced to go on with him, to keep him, because he is at the center of our project. The fact that a club like Manchester United comes looking for our player makes us proud. ""Arnautovic is a winning bet, we all made great efforts to bring him here and he responded on the pitch, we want to go forward with him, our will is not to sell but to strengthen and complete the team to make an important season."" Manchester United could be left extremely thin in the striker department with Edinson Cavani and potentially Ronaldo departing in the same summer, and their momentary pursuit of Darwin Nunez shelved with the Uruguayan player instead joining rivals Liverpool. Martial impressed in pre-season but has struggled with fitness after his short-term loan to Sevilla. Marcus Rashford, while not strictly a striker, has been below his best for much of the time since Euro 2020, and Bruno Fernandes is preferred as a midfielder to a false-nine. The Red Devils are eager, then, to address their shortage up front and will try to secure a move of some sort by the end of August.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arnautovic-priceless-man-utd-bologna-director-target-not-for/blt8846689ac8672f67,Ed Mackey,7d499839-d828-4247-a254-44aa6ed5ee74
Man City's Mahrez: Bernardo brings me my coffee like a little boy because he's scared of me!,"Riyad Mahrez has poked fun at his Manchester City colleague Bernardo Silva, claiming ""he brings me my coffee like a little boy because he's scared of me"". Mahrez and Bernardo have both played key roles in City's success over the past few years, linking up in the final third to great effect to help the club win multiple domestic honours. Since moving to the Etihad Stadium from Monaco in 2017, Bernardo has picked up four Premier League winners' medals, while Mahrez has three to his name since joining from Leicester a year later, and the pair also enjoy a strong relationship off the pitch. During the latest edition of City's in-house documentary titled ""Together: champions again!"", Bernardo and Mahrez discussed their most important pre-match ritual. Portugal international Bernardo began the segment by saying: ""Always one hour before the game, it's my only superstitious thing, I always go and get a coffee for me and for Riyad."" Mahrez then confirmed the agreement, but also joked that Bernardo only makes him the beverage because he is afraid of him.

Man Utd finally set to seal ¬£71m De Jong signing after agreeing deal with Barcelona,"Manchester United are finally closing in on a deal to sign Frenkie de Jong after exhaustive negotiations with Barcelona. They have agreed to pay up to ¬£71 million ($84m) to land Erik ten Hag's top transfer target, with personal terms not expected to be an issue for the Netherlands international.  Despite the midfielder‚Äôs public insistence that he wants to stay at Camp Nou, United remain confident he is open to a move to Old Trafford and a reunion with his former Ajax manager.  United and Barca had agreed an outline base fee of around ¬£55m ($65m) earlier this summer, but it is believed that could now rise to up to ¬£63m ($74.5m) up front, with the rest made up in add-ons. As previously reported by GOAL, United always expected negotiations to be protracted in their pursuit of De Jong.  The 25-year-old was never going to push for a move away from the Catalan giants, while issues over deferred wages further complicated the transfer.  But the Dutchman is seen as pivotal to Ten Hag‚Äôs plans to introduce a possession-based system to United, with the move to sign Christian Eriksen also part of that thinking.  United's chief executive, Richard Arnold, and football director, John Murtough, both stayed behind rather than travel on the club‚Äôs tour of Thailand and Australia in a bid to push through United‚Äôs stalling transfer business.  They met with Barca officials in Catalunya this week to thrash out a deal for De Jong, and Barca‚Äôs signing of Raphinha from Leeds United has also increased their need to sell in a bid to raise funds.  Personal terms still have to be agreed with De Jong, but GOAL expects those negotiations to be concluded swiftly.  Despite the player‚Äôs preference being to stay at Barca, United have always been confident that he would accept a move to Old Trafford. That is why they have continued to negotiate for him in the belief that he would not reject a switch if a fee could be agreed with Barca. They have also been in regular contact with De Jong's agent, Ali Dursun, this summer over the signing of another of his clients, Tyrell Malacia. Dursun, who also represents Donny van de Beek and Victor Lindelof, spent two days at United‚Äôs Carrington training ground earlier this month. United's business has been slow so far this summer, but things are picking up speed now, with deals for De Jong, Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez all close to completion.  In terms of other targets, Ajax winger Antony remains a priority, but United are nearly ¬£20m short of the Dutch champions‚Äô ¬£68m ($80m) asking price.  A right back is also on Ten Hag‚Äôs shortlist as he looks to upgrade on Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Diogo Dalot.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-seal-71m-de-jong-signing-agreeing-deal-barcelona/bltf839393910f0a875,James Robson,3672258a-865e-410c-b7e3-40b494ec19f1
Arsenal confirm squad number for USMNT star Turner as goalkeeper officially completes ¬£8m transfer,"Arsenal have officially completed the signing of United States international goalkeeper Matt Turner, with the 28-year-old linking up with the Gunners after bidding farewell to MLS side the New England Revolution. A deal for the USMNT star was done back in February, with Turner allowed to remain in his homeland until the summer as he bids to become the USMNT's No.1 for the 2022 World Cup. Turner is now ready to provide competition for Aaron Ramsdale at Emirates Stadium, with an ¬£8 million ($10m) deal bringing him onto the Gunners' books. It has been announced that Turner will take the No.30 jersey at the Emirates Stadium. He inherits that shirt from Eddie Nkeitah, with the striker who recently signed a new contract with the Gunners opting to move into the No.14 spot that was once occupied by club legend Thierry Henry. Turner will also be following in the footsteps of the likes of Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Yossi Benayoun and Jeremie Aliadiere when it comes to filling the No.30 berth in Arsenal‚Äôs squad. üî• MT30 üî• pic.twitter.com/9sZzoIlySO Turner‚Äôs arrival in north London is likely to nudge German goalkeeper Bernd Leno through the exits as he goes in search of more regular game time. Ramsdale has become the go-to option for Mikel Arteta between the sticks, but Turner is expected to challenge for the right to take on starting duties. Arteta has told Arsenal‚Äôs official website: ‚ÄúMatt is an experienced goalkeeper who will bring high quality to our squad. ‚ÄúHe has shown with his performances in recent years in both MLS and at international level with the United States that he is a goalkeeper who will give us added strength going into next season. ‚ÄúWe welcome Matt and his family to the club and we look forward to working together in the years to come.‚Äù Technical director Edu added: ‚ÄúWe are delighted that Matt is joining us. Matt is a goalkeeper with established qualities and experience, who will be a great addition to our squad. ‚ÄúWe identified Matt some time ago and worked hard to ensure that his transfer was complete so he could join us in time for our pre-season in July. ‚ÄúWe now look forward to Matt joining us, settling into his new home and working ahead of next season.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-squad-number-turner-usmnt-goalkeeper-8m-transfer/bltbddea332d23e5b5f,Chris Burton,1aabf6f6-0b8c-4746-8bef-d9a34a1980a8
Watch: Mane suffers sickening blow to head in Afcon clash - before scoring wonder goal minutes later,"Sadio Mane suffered a sickening blow to the head while playing for Senegal in their last 16 Africa Cup of Nations meeting with Cape Verde - only to stay on the pitch and score a brilliant goal shortly afterwards. Mane appeared to be knocked unconscious after being clattered by Josimar Dias in the 52nd minute of the game, the Cape Verde keeper being sent off as a result. Astonishingly, Mane was allowed to stay on the field, and scored a beautiful curled strike in the 63rd minute - before finally being replaced a few minutes later as Senegal went on to win the game 2-0 and reach the quarter-finals.

Mane got there first, with Josimar slamming into the Liverpool winger. Slow motion replays appeared to indicate that Mane was unconscious as he fell to the floor. Josimar was sent off as a result after a lengthy VAR check, leaving Cape Verde down to nine men after Ptrick Andrade was dismissed in the first half. Remarkably however, Mane was allowed to play on despite the rules about players suffering from possible concussions - and showed his quality a little over 10 minutes later. ‚öΩÔ∏è ¬°GOOOOL!Con la aprobaci√≥n del VAR, Sadio Man√© le da la ventaja a Senegal#TeamSenegal 1-0 #TeamCapeVerde üá∏üá≥üÜöüá®üáª‚§µÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/sy1tVtUDxW Collecting a half-cleared corner on the edge of the Cape Verde penalty area in the 63rd minute, Mane had the time and space to pick his spot and place a wonderful shot in off the underside of the crossbar.

'We never spoke with Zidane' - PSG president Al-Khelaifi denies club ever wanted French manager to replace Pochettino,"Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has denied ever wanting Zinedine Zidane to manage the club despite reports suggesting Zidane had rejected an approach to take over at the Parc des Princes. Al-Khelaifi said he never spoke with Zidane, formally or informally, to try and get him to return to coaching after he left Real Madrid following the 2020-21 season. PSG are expected to announce the dismissal of Mauricio Pochettino soon, with Nice head coach Christophe Galtier considered the top candidate to replace the Argentine. GOAL, along with many other publications, reported earlier this month that negotiations between Zidane and PSG had reached an advanced stage, only for them to break down days later. Galtier has since emerged as PSG's favoured option, while Zidane has publicly confirmed he does want to return to coaching at some point. But Al-Khelaifi is insistent Zidane was never in his plans. ""I'll tell you one thing: we never spoke with him, neither directly nor indirectly,"" the club president told Le Parisien.  ""Many clubs are interested in him, national teams too, but we have never discussed with him. We have chosen a coach who will be the best for what we want to put in place."" Galtier led Nice to a fifth-place finish this past term after winning Ligue 1 with Lille the season before. ""We are discussing with Nice, it is not a secret,"" Al-Khelaifi said. ""I hope that we will find an agreement quickly, but I respect Nice and the president [Jean-Pierre] Rivere, everyone defends their interests."" With PSG seemingly no longer an option, there is speculation that Zidane could hold out for the France national team job after the 2022 World Cup. Current boss Didier Deschamps has not indicated his plans after the tournament, and if he were to leave, Zidane would likely be seen as an option to take his place. ""Yes. I have a lot [left to give], or at least something,"" Zidane said this week about his coaching ambitions. ""I want to continue along this path. ""I want to continue, I still have this flame, it's my passion, football.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zidane-psg-president-al-khelaifi-denies-club-ever-wanted/blt4af9f2d626c92992,Dan Bernstein,7af5359c-dab4-4626-b407-374655165a55
Guardiola hits back at critics: I'm NOT at Man City to win the Champions League!,"Pep Guardiola has hit out at his critics over his lack of European success at Manchester City as he suggested that his stint as the club's manager will not be deemed as a failure if he is not able to win the Champions League.  While Guardiola has won the Premier League title four times in the last six years, he has often been targeted by critics for not winning the European Cup. And now Guardiola has responded to the naysayers by suggesting that he is not the ""master of the universe"", and that winning everything is not possible. Speaking at a press conference ahead of his side's opening Premier League game against West Ham on Sunday, Guardiola said: ""People might say it's an excuse, but I'm not here to win the Champions League. The owners didn‚Äôt ask me (to win it). Of course, they want it - and I am the first to want it. But it was the same with [Bayern] Munich and with Barcelona, where I won it twice.  ‚ÄúEvery year I want to win all four titles. And if I am a manager in 30 or 40 years, I will want to win the Champions League every season. But I didn't feel a failure in the two years at Barcelona and the three with Bayern when we didn't win. ""We want to win it - but at the same time I'm not the master of the universe. We try to do it. We were closer last season - and we will try again this season. But I'm aware how difficult the opponents are and how the competition is so difficult.‚Äù Despite his status as one of the greatest coaches of the 21st century, Guardiola's record in the Champions League is relatively modest. He has won the competition just twice, both times with Barcelona, with it now 11 years since he last tasted success in the competition. He was labelled 'Fraudiola' by some fans after failing to deliver European success at Bayern Munich, while his time at City has been dominated by questions of whether he overthinks his tactical decisions for major European ties. That was certainly the case when City were beaten in the final by Chelsea in 2021, as Guardiola opted not to select a natural defensive midfielder and instead played Ilkay Gundogan in what was an unfamiliar role for the Germany star. Last season, City looked well set to reach a second successive final, only for Real Madrid to score twice late on in the second leg of their semi-final to take the match into extra-time, where Karim Benzema netted to seal victory for Los Blancos.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/guardiola-hits-back-critics-man-city-win-champions-league/blt129332463d59f59c,Ritabrata Banerjee,da6f5d43-90e6-4bbb-ad92-dcd5147d4864

'We're not considering Messi' - Barcelona president Laporta crushes talk of shock Camp Nou transfer return,"Barcelona have no interest in re-signing Lionel Messi after letting him depart to Paris Saint-Germain last summer amid financial difficulties. Club president Joan Laporta said he is not in direct communication with the player and does not see the PSG forward as an option for the Blaugrana. Messi had been linked back to Camp Nou in Spanish media after PSG were eliminated from the Champions League earlier this month, but Laporta has crushed talk of his return. ""I‚Äôve received no message from Messi or his camp over a possibility of returning to Barcelona,"" Laporta said on RAC1. ""As of today, we are not going to be raising this issue. ‚ÄúI no longer have a fluid communication with Messi like I did before he left. His departure almost made me feel more bad for personal and family reasons rather than just strictly sporting ones. ‚ÄúWe're not considering [Messi's return]. We are building a new team, with a mix of young players and experience - the symbiosis is working. But Leo is Leo and he‚Äôll always be a winner. ""For me it sure wasn't easy [for him to go], but, as it happened, I thought about the club [finances], I couldn't put it at more risk. I think we did what we had to do."" Messi has not received the same universal respect at PSG as he did at Barcelona, with boos recently ringing out at Parc des Princes, and that has led to reports that he misses his old Camp Nou home.

England up to fourth in FIFA world rankings after Euro 2022 triumph as USWNT maintain top spot,"England have moved up to fourth in the FIFA world rankings after their Euro 2022 triumph, while the United States women's national team have retained top spot on the back of their CONCACAF Championship victory. The Lionesses became the first England team from either the men's or women's games to win a major trophy since 1966 by beating Germany in the European Championship final last weekend. FIFA have recognised their achievement in the publication of their latest rankings, while beaten finalists Germany have climbed to second place behind the Americans. England were sat in eighth prior to the Euros, but have moved up four places into fourth as a result of their run to glory. Still dreaming of this: pic.twitter.com/g45W7NRGFj The tournament hosts have not leapfrogged Germany however, with the beaten finalists advancing up one slot into second - replacing semi-finalists Sweden. The USWNT stormed to their ninth CONCACAF Championship success in July, qualifying for the 2024 Olympic Games in the process. They remain in top spot in the world rankings, a position they've held since 2017, and are due to face England in a one-off clash between the World Cup winners and European champions on October 7.

Man Utd FA Youth Cup 2011 final winners: Who was in the team & where are they now?,"Manchester United are famed for their production of home-grown talent, with the Class of ‚Äò92 earning a place in football folklore that will stand the test of time, but it has been 11 years since the club last savoured FA Youth Cup glory. That barren run on the silverware front for an U18 set-up that has continued to deliver first-team stars to the senior fold may be brought to a close in the current campaign as the Red Devils‚Äô class of 2021-22 prepare to face Nottingham Forest in a notable final on May 11. Who, though, figured in the last United side to claim that particular trophy back in 2011 and where are they now, with some household names having followed in the footsteps of David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes when it comes to gracing a fabled academy system? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ Goalkeeper: Sam Johnstone Was always going to find it difficult to break through at Old Trafford with David de Gea blocking his path. Johnstone took in 10 loan spells at seven different clubs before joining West Brom on a permanent basis in 2018. He has seen Premier League football with the Baggies and has three senior caps for England. Right-back: Michael Keane Only took in five appearances for United, but is another to have gone on to earn England recognition elsewhere. Keane has 12 caps and one goal for his country and is currently looking to help Everton avoid relegation out of the Premier League. Severed ties with the Red Devils in January 2015 when a loan deal at Burnley was turned into a permanent transfer. Centre-half: Sean McGinty Joined United from Charlton in 2009 and took in a number of loan spells on the back of a Youth Cup triumph, with time spent at Morecambe, Oxford United, Carlisle United and Tranmere Rovers. Left Old Trafford to join Sheffield United in League One and has led a rather nomadic existence since then, with a four-year stint in Scotland currently seeing him at Ayr United. Centre-half: Tom Thorpe Captained United to Youth Cup glory in 2011 and was expected to become a first-team star of the future. He was, however, to make one solitary first-team appearance ‚Äì when replacing Angel Di Maria in a meeting with West Ham in 2015 ‚Äì and was released in 2015. Has spent time with Rotherham and in India since then, but has been without a club since 2018. Left-back: Michele Fornasier Fiorentina filed a complaint to FIFA when United swooped to steal Fornasier away from them in 2009, but no action was taken and the Italian eventually headed back to his homeland with little impact made in England. Has taken in Serie A outings for Sampdoria and Pescara, but is currently turning out in Serie C for Monopoli. Right wing: Jesse Lingard Had to be patient in pursuit of first-team opportunities at United, with loan spells taken in at Leicester City, Birmingham City, Brighton & Hove Albion and Derby County before getting his big break under Louis van Gaal at 22 years of age. Has gone on to make over 230 appearances for the Red Devils, scoring 35 goals and earning 32 England caps, but will be leaving as a free agent in the summer. Centre midfield: Ryan Tunnicliffe Made two League Cup appearances for United in 2012-13, but it quickly became clear that he was going to have to find regular game time elsewhere. Former Red Devils coach Rene Meulensteen took him to Fulham, but that move did not really work out and he is now at League One side Portsmouth after previously gracing the books at Wigan Athletic, Blackburn Rovers and Millwall. Centre midfield: Paul Pogba The most successful product of United‚Äôs last FA Youth Cup-winning side, with the enigmatic French midfielder savouring World Cup glory with his country in 2018. He returned to Old Trafford two years prior to that, in a record-breaking ¬£89 million ($110m) transfer from Juventus, having previously walked away from Manchester in 2012. Pogba will, after more than 220 generally inconsistent appearances, be heading to pastures new once again in 2022 as he prepares to hit free agency. Left wing: Ravel Morrison One of the most naturally-gifted players that United have ever produced, but one that proved tricky to unlock full potential in. While Morrison‚Äôs ability was never in doubt, his attitude has been questioned on a regular basis down the years and he remains a tale of what could have been. Has spent the 2021-22 campaign with Wayne Rooney at Derby County after trekking the globe to spend time at West Ham United, Lazio, Atlas, Ostersund and ADO Den Haag. Striker: Will Keane The twin brother of Everton star Michael and another senior international performer, this time with the Republic of Ireland. Keane made three appearances for United, with two of those coming in the Premier League, but was allowed to join Hull City following the arrival of Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford. Has been catching the eye in League One of late at Ipswich Town and Wigan Athletic, with 25 goals recorded for the Latics in a promotion-winning 2021-22 campaign. Striker: Gyliano van Velzen Won the Youth Cup at the end of his first season with the Red Devils, having completed a move from the famed academy system at Ajax. Joined Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at Royal Antwerp when making a loan move in 2012, but failed to make an impact and headed back to the Netherlands at Utrecht in 2013. Briefly returned to England in 2019-20 to spend time with Crawley Town and Aldershot Town, but is now back home again at Telstar. Substitutes Larnell Cole Like Tunnicliffe, a move to Fulham was made in January 2014 but Cole failed to make the grade in west London. Is without a club at present having spent time with Tranmere Rovers, FC United of Manchester and Radcliffe Borough since leaving Craven Cottage. Tyler Blackett Took in 11 Premier League appearances for United in the 2014-15 season, but was unable to establish himself at Old Trafford and eventually linked up with Reading in 2016. Left the Royals for Nottingham Forest in 2020 but is now in MLS with FC Cincinnati. John Cofie United splashed out ¬£1 million to sign him as a 14-year-old from Burnley and had high hopes for the promising forward. Quickly dropped into the non-league and spent time in Ireland, Australia and the Philippines before retiring at the age of 27 in 2020 to focus on coaching.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-fa-youth-cup-2011-final-winners-team-where-are-they/bltc1e0332d35102099,Chris Burton,60134d05-6e4e-4341-bf25-b92a20a691fa
"Messi will thrive at PSG without Pochettino, says Di Maria amid manager exit reports","Angel Di Maria says Lionel Messi will thrive next season at Paris Saint-Germain after the expected departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino. Di Maria has already announced he is leaving the club, with crunch talks now ongoing at Juventus, but he remains hopeful for the future in the French capital, where fellow Argentina star Messi will be entering his second campaign. PSG's attack was unable to hit its top gear for much of Messi's debut term, with injuries and illness playing a factor, and they could now look to find a new head coach to jumpstart the group. ""It seems like they also want [Pochettino] to leave,"" Di Maria said to TyC Sports. ""There will be a very big change, but I think Messi can handle it.  ""It will help him to be much better next season. I think he will start very well because he ended up contributing goals, giving assists, feeling very comfortable and adapting more and more [late this past season]."" ""There are other players who will surely leave,"" he said. ""Mine was the easiest because they didn't have to renew me. On the one hand it hurt and on the other, it didn't.  ""I left in a very special way. It was an unforgettable night, that an Argentine in another country has a farewell like mine, not everyone does it. The affection of the PSG fan, the ones behind the goal, is the most difficult thing to achieve.  ""That I go outside, that they sing for me alone and made a mural for me to sign are things that remain in the memory."" Messi scored six goals and produced 14 assists in 26 matches in Ligue 1 after his transfer from Barcelona. Though he came under criticism for his goal output, his chance creation remained among the best in Europe and his late-season play offered hope of a strong start to next term. He's also done well for Argentina over the past two weeks, starring in the Finalissima and scoring five times in a friendly against Estonia.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-will-thrive-at-psg-without-pochettino-says-di-maria/blt3cfd17c5f47057fa,Dan Bernstein,d5e271ea-2ecf-4b40-a9e0-673de2316ad7

"Leeds players were 'over-trained' under Bielsa & 'stress levels were incredibly high', claims Marsch","Jesse Marsch believes Leeds United's injury woes this season came down to predecessor Marcelo Bielsa's methods, with the American noting the ""stress"" left in the Argentine's wake. The former RB Leipzig boss succeeded Bielsa at Elland Road following the latter's dismissal, with the club missing key faces through a slew of fitness problems and facing a fearsome relegation battle. Marsch has since steadied the ship, and helped to breathe new energy into the Whites, but now he admits that his task has been a difficult one given the atmopshere he inherited. ""I could see from just watching games from afar, and talking to people within the club, that the stress levels were incredibly high,"" Marsch told talkSPORT. ""You could see it in their faces. You could see in the 15th minute that some of them were already at the max ‚Äì and that shouldn‚Äôt be the case. ""The injury issue, for me, had a lot to do with the training methodology. These players were over-trained and it led to them being physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically in a difficult place to recover from week to week, game to game.¬† ""I have a very specific methodology with the way I work and I‚Äôve had a reputation for high running data, but also having healthy, fit, strong players who can meet the standards of the game we want."" While fortunes look to have turned a corner, the American has admitted that it has been a tough task reshaping a Leeds team defined by Bielsa's characteristic style, which he paid tribute to while acknowledging the struggles faced to replace it. ""Marcelo had such a strong man-v-man playing style,"" he added. ""Trying to rip the players away from three-and-a-half years of being instructed to do exactly that, transitioning into what we‚Äôre trying to do, has been massively challenging for the players to adapt to.¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve worked really hard at it, but they still fall into bad habits, especially when they‚Äôre fatigued on the pitch.

Southampton fans tease Liverpool by singing national anthem in wake of FA Cup controversy,"Southampton supporters teased their Liverpool counterparts by signing the national anthem during their Premier League clash on Tuesday. A section of fans were heard singing God Save the Queen just after scoring the opening goal on Tuesday, just days after Liverpool fans booed the song at the FA Cup finale. In addition, the club played the Sex Pistols' version of the song at half-time in a further joke towards their opponents. Saints fans sang the song as Liverpool find themselves in a bit of controversy stemming from the FA Cup finale. Liverpool fans were heard booing Prince William as well as the national anthem, with Reds' fans having done so numerous times over the last few decades. When asked about his thoughts about the club's fans booing the national anthem earlier this week, Jurgen Klopp replied: ""Of course I have thoughts. The question is why does it happen?

Arsenal step up Arthur transfer pursuit as Juventus star's agent arrives for talks,"Arsenal are ramping up their efforts to land Arthur from Juventus, with talks taking place on Wednesday with the midfielder‚Äôs agent. The Gunners have been pushing to complete a deal for the Brazilian and want to take him on loan for the remainder of the season. Juventus have yet to give the green light to the deal, however, as they continue to search for a replacement. Arsenal are keen to get Arthur‚Äôs move finalised as quickly as possible, with technical director Edu holding face-to-face talks with the midfielder‚Äôs agent on Wednesday afternoon. Federico Pastorello travelled to Arsenal‚Äôs London Colney training base for the meeting and the Gunners hope negotiations with Juventus will soon start to move forward. Arsenal want to bring the 25-year-old on loan for the remainder of the season in a bid to bolster Mikel Arteta‚Äôs midfield options following the departure of Ainsley Maitland-Niles to Roma. Arthur meanwhile wants to make the move to London, with the player viewing the Premier League as the best league in the world. Juventus do not want to let Arthur leave without finding a replacement. Although he has found his opportunities limited this season, the former Barcelona player still remains a valuable member of Massimiliano Allegri‚Äôs squad. He started on Tuesday night and put in an impressive performance against Sampdoria in the Coppa Italia, registering an assist in a 4-1 win.

Jorginho 'haunted' by costly penalty misses as Italy crash out of World Cup play-offs,"Italy star Jorginho cut a dejected figure at the end of his side's shock defeat to North Macedonia on Thursday, admitting that he is tortured by two costly penalty misses during the World Cup qualifying campaign. The Euro 2020 champions went down to a late defeat in Palermo to bow out of the running for Qatar. It is the second consecutive World Cup finals the Azzurri will miss, the first time in their history that has occurred. Jorginho, usually one of football's most assured spot-kick practicioners, erred twice in as many matches against Switzerland during the first round of qualifying, depriving Italy of two wins that would have seen them take first place ahead of their neighbours in Group C. ‚ÄúIt hurts when I think about it, because I do still think about it and it will haunt me for the rest of my life,"" the Chelsea midfielder told RAI Sport. ""Stepping up there twice and not being able to help your team and your country is something that I will carry with me forever, and it weighs on me. ‚ÄúPeople say we need to lift our heads and carry on, but it‚Äôs tough.‚Äù Italy became on Thursday the first reigning European champion to miss out on the World Cup since Greece in 2006 and Jorginho, one of the heroes of their Euro 2020 triumph, admits that it will take time to recover from such a blow. ‚ÄúIt is hard to explain what happened,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt hurts so much. I‚Äôll be honest, I am still incredulous. I don‚Äôt think we lacked creativity, as we always dominated matches and created so many chances.

Barcelona to move to Olympic Stadium for 2023-24 season as club confirms Camp Nou renovations,"Barcelona are set to move to the Olympic Stadium for the 2023-24 season as the club has confirmed that Camp Nou will undergo renovations. The Catalan club's home stadium opened back in 1957 and is currently the largest in Europe, with a total capacity of 99,354. The iconic venue, which will be renamed the Spotify Camp Nou from 2022-23 onwards after the club struck a lucrative sponsorship agreement with the streaming company in March, is now set for a significant upgrade, with the third tier pencilled in for demolition next summer. The club have released an official statement confirming the news, which reads: ""Renovation work on the Camp Nou, the epicentre of the¬†Espai Bar√ßa¬†project, will begin this June, as soon as the football season has ended, and in accordance with the building permit approved this morning. ""The work will focus on the first and second tier, technological aspects, the environs of the stadium, and exterior urbanisation. ""Actions inside the Camp Nou will include the demolition of the additional structure in the South Goal zone where the¬†Medical Centre¬†was located, restoration work, anti-carbonation and waterproofing of the stands, as well as structural finishes and the improvement and renovation of retransmission systems."" Barca have added on their decision to push their renovation plans back by a year: ""As President Joan Laporta said a few weeks ago, given the uncertainties generated by the war in Ukraine, especially with regard to the cost and availability of materials, a precautionary principle is to be observed in order to minimise risks and protect next season‚Äôs revenue, but with the least possible impact on the works schedule.  ""The demolition of the third tier will therefore go ahead in the summer of 2023, which will win time given the current uncertainty of prices, and will ensure that the Camp Nou can operate at virtually full capacity next season. Demolition any earlier would have meant having to play the 2022/23 season with just 50% of capacity."" Agreement on the transformation of Espai Bar√ßa and work on new Camp Nou to begin in June Work will be carried out on Camp Nou throughout the 2023-24 campaign with a view to reopening at 50 per cent of its full capacity the following season. Barca have lined up a temporary home whilst renovations are being undertaken, with Spain's Olympic Stadium, also known as the Llu√≠s Companys Stadium, set to host their matches on a temporary basis. Based in in Montju√Øc, the ground has a capacity of 55,926, and was the main venue for the 1992 Olympic Games. The Liga giants have also confirmed that they expect renovations on Camp Nou to be fully completed at some point in 2025-26, with a new 360-degree screen set to be included in the final design. ""The future Camp Nou will incorporate state-of-the-art technologies, including a 360¬∫ screen inside the ‚Äòbowl‚Äô that will offer a new fan experience,"" Barca's statement continues. ""The security and vehicle access control systems will also be improved and maximum use will be made of the possibilities offered by 5G connectivity.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/barca-to-move-to-olympic-stadium-for-2023-24-season-as-club/bltd4769ba9c58175d7,James Westwood,098b8b4f-3acf-4121-965d-40cd727f29be
'How can you boo the greatest of all time?' - Henry defends Messi from PSG fan jeers,"Thierry Henry was furious to hear Paris Saint-Germain supporters give Lionel Messi a rough reception following their elimination from the Champions League.  Messi and Neymar were among the players singled out for boos and jeers upon their return to France after PSG let slip a winning position to bow out of the competition against Real Madrid.  The Argentine was out on Sunday, though, and his absence appeared to be felt keenly as the Ligue 1 leaders were thrashed 3-0 by Monaco. ""Last week, PSG fans booed Messi. How can you boo the greatest of all time?"" ex-Arsenal, Barcelona and France ace Henry fired to Amazon Prime FR  after Sunday's reverse. ""The guy that has assisted the most goals in Ligue 1?

The 34-year-old has netted just seven times in 26 games for PSG, compared to 38 in 47 during his last campaign at Camp Nou.  But he still remains a potent threat around the area and has laid on 10 goals in Ligue 1 in just 18 appearances, a mark only shared by colleague Kylian Mbappe and Rennes' Benjamin Bourigeaud.  While Mbappe may be headed to Madrid this summer, Messi's future will also be of concern to PSG, with Barca coach and his former team-mate Xavi pledging that the doors at Camp Nou will always be open to the superstar as long as he is in charge.

Erik Ten Hag Manchester United | New EPL Manager Betting Tips,"By Andrew Passaro & Matthew Williams Manchester United‚Äôs season of misery is over. After finishing with 58 points, their worst point total ever in the Premier League, they will bring in another new manager, Erik ten Hag, as they try to return to the glory days.¬† Ten Hag arrives from Ajax, where he won the last four league titles and two of the previous four KNVB Cups in the Dutch Eredivisie. In addition, the 52-year-old pushed Ajax to the UEFA Champions League semifinals in 2019. Manchester United‚Äôs squad is all over the place and has needed a proper turnover for a while now. Thankfully, United‚Äôs board is finally committed to a total tear-down.¬† The spine of the team is in disarray. Paul Pogba, now with Juventus, went from being one of the best young players in the world to someone without a notable moment during his six years with United. Harry Maguire was the most expensive defender in football but has become a weekly meme on Twitter for his shambolic gameplay. Unlike Pogba, Maguire is still in the squad ‚Äì for now. Rapha√´l Varane was brought in to solidify the backline with his experience with Real Madrid and as a World Cup winner for France. Unfortunately, the center back struggled with injury and was only featured 29 times last season.¬† Jadon Sancho was courted for over a year before United finally brought him in, only for him to score just five goals with three assists in all competitions.¬† On a brighter note, the Red Devils did bring Cristiano Ronaldo back after more than a decade away. The Portuguese legend did what he always does: score goals.¬† Ronaldo notched 24 tallies in all competitions and 18 in the Premier League. The only issue? The 37-year-old has made it clear he wishes to leave Manchester United, a situation still up in the air. Ten Hag prefers to play a 4-3-3 formation with a squad that plays out of the back with a heavy press. This strategy is typical for a Dutch manager from Ajax.¬† The new Red Devils manager built his squad at Ajax around youth, with forward Anthony Elanga showing signs of being a quality player. This philosophy would be an ideal way to build the new Manchester United. Ten Hag has also proven he doesn‚Äôt need the best players in the world to be successful, especially after reaching the Champions League semifinal with Du≈°an Tadiƒá as a center forward.¬† The Dutch newcomer will need to cut down on deadweight players and maximize the production from Manchester United‚Äôs youth until he can rebuild the roster.¬† The immediate goal is to surmount the upstart organizations pushing for a Champions League and Europa berth rather than compete with the perennial powerhouses Manchester City and Liverpool.¬† Ten Hag will have one familiar face with this team in midfielder Donny van de Beek. However, his previous two seasons with United have featured him just 50 times, mainly off the bench.¬† Van de Beek was loaned to Everton during the second half of the season last year, and his much-heralded move from Ajax to England hasn‚Äôt been a smooth ride. An interesting quandary will be where Ten Hag lines up Man United‚Äôs top players and how many will remain with the club. The 27-year-old Bruno Fernandes can feature as an eight but typically plays more like a 10. Man United will also need to move on from various veteran players who do not fit Ten Hag‚Äôs system.¬† David de Gea is still one of the best shot-stoppers in the EPL, and his distribution might not be suitable for Ten Hag‚Äôs ‚Äúbuild from the back‚Äù philosophy.¬† Nemanja Matiƒá (Roma of Serie A) has already left, along with Jesse Lingard (Nottingham Forest), Edinson Cavani, and Paul Pogba. Phil Jones and Juan Mata are likely to join this exodus. It has been a busy summer for United, who has been linked with a batch of Ten Hag‚Äôs former Ajax players such as Antony, and center back Lisandro Mart√≠nez, who recently signed with the club for ¬£48.3m.¬† Martinez is the third acquisition of the summer after left back Tyrell Malacia (Feyenoord) and attacking midfielder Christian Eriksen (Brentford). Manchester United also remains interested in Barcelona‚Äôs Frenkie de Jong, who stood out at Ajax from 2016-2019. Barca is having financial issues and could be convinced to sell for the right price, but the Red Devils face competition from Premier League rivals Chelsea. There are rumors that Ronaldo might not want to stick around as the club will participate in the Europa League and not the Champions League.¬† Ronaldo, who has played in 187 matches in the Champions League, is in excellent shape, but he will turn 38 in February. Will he sacrifice one of his waning years playing football on Thursdays?¬† Also, if he sticks around, will he even play comfortably in Ten Hag‚Äôs press-heavy philosophy? Ten Hag will have difficulty lifting Manchester United back to its glory days. With so many players leaving, the Dutch manager will have to integrate plenty of new and potentially less-than-ready faces.¬† A Top 4 finish this coming season is a mighty stretch unless they can bring in significant upgrades at every position ‚Äì which is counteractive to the desired rebuild.¬† Also, without the Champions League, Ten Hag might have trouble luring stars to Old Trafford.¬† The fact remains that Manchester United will likely get worse before they get better, so it would be wise to place a wager for a finish outside the Top 4 and even Top 6 if available.

"Man Utd vs West Ham: Predictions, odds & betting tips","This article contains affiliate links. We may receive a commission on any sales we generate from it Manchester United will be hoping to leapfrog West Ham in the Premier League table when the sides meet at Old Trafford on Saturday. Ralf Rangnick‚Äôs men are two points adrift of their fourth-placed opponents going into the weekend, having played one game fewer. Beaten 1-0 by Wolves in their last league home game, Man Utd are available at 17/20 (1.85) with bet365 to bounce back with an important victory here. However, West Ham have already won on this ground this season in September‚Äôs Carabao Cup clash and are available at 3/1 (4.0) to come out on top once again. Just one of the 10 league games at this ground this season has resulted in a draw, but you can get odds of 14/5 (3.80) on this one finishing up all-square. Cristiano Ronaldo is 10/3 (4.33) favourite to open the scoring against a team he has fired past six times in eight previous encounters, with Mason Greenwood priced at 6/1 (7.0) after his goal at Brentford in midweek. Top scorer Michail Antonio is the visitors' 13/2 (7.50) favourite to break the deadlock, although Jarrod Bowen looks a better bet at 10/1 (11.0) following four goals in his last three fixtures. While the Red Devils will have been delighted to score three goals and take maximum points away to Brentford, Ivan Toney‚Äôs late goal means they have now gone five league games without a clean sheet. This defensive fragility is likely to be tested by David Moyes‚Äô men, who have not failed to score in seven games in all competitions - hitting the net 15 times in that run. However, the visitors have also kept just one clean sheet and conceded 11 goals in their last six league matches, making a high-scoring game seem likely. Indeed, odds of 20/21 (1.95) look like solid value on over 2.5 goals being scored and both teams getting on target for Manchester United‚Äôs fourth league game in five and a fifth in six for West Ham. All odds correct at time of writing. begambleaware.org.

How Messi became the latest superstar dragged into PSG's 'player power' row ,"The quality of the Paris Saint-Germain squad cannot be questioned but on occasion the attitude has been. The invisible work that the best teams and individuals do away from the field is not always evident at the French capital club, where some players have earned a reputation for living life in the fast lane and acting out when things do not go their way. On the field, problems have manifested as angry outbursts when facing adversity, best typified by Idrissa Gueye‚Äôs red card in the second leg of last season‚Äôs Champions League semi-final defeat to Manchester City. Meanwhile, star players have regularly come under fire for their off-field lifestyles. Marco Verratti, Leandro Paredes, Neymar and even poster boy Kylian Mbappe are regularly pictured at high-profile parties, with Neymar's 28th birthday a particularly notorious example. And now Lionel Messi has been dragged into it. Over the Christmas break, the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner was pictured at numerous parties back home in Argentina and ultimately contracted a Covid-19 infection, the effects of which could yet rule him out of Sunday‚Äôs Ligue 1 clash with Lyon. Following Monday‚Äôs Coupe de France victory over Vannes, coach Mauricio Pochettino frankly admitted that he had no update to offer on Messi‚Äôs condition as he had ‚Äúnot heard from‚Äù the player. ‚ÄúThe coach is above everyone, whether you are a star or not,‚Äù former PSG player Jerome Rothen raged to RMC. ‚ÄúThrough his words, he admits he doesn‚Äôt know where Messi is. It simply means that Messi didn‚Äôt answer his phone to speak with Pochettino. ‚ÄúI find that shocking from Messi. The coach must do as he wants.‚Äù Neymar, in particular, has become a target of criticism because of his regular forays to nightclubs. A string of long-term injury problems have not helped the Brazilian‚Äôs cause, while his lamentable form this season has left him vulnerable to such attacks. Presently convalescing from his latest setback, an injury sustained against Saint-Etienne in November, he was given extra time off over the Christmas break in his homeland. While an ultra-professional figure like Cristiano Ronaldo, who famously only drinks water, might have used the time to recover, Neymar took to Instagram to show the world just how good a time he was having. PSG‚Äôs problem is that such an attitude is endemic among their squad. This persistent undermining of Pochettino, Rothen believes, extends from throughout the playing staff. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt respect your coach, you can‚Äôt get to where you want to go,"" he lamented. ""PSG suffers greatly from this in recent years.‚Äù Messi, as a new arrival, is not the source of these problems, which has been seen but ignored by those above the parade of coaches who have tried and failed to win the Champions League for the Parc des Princes side. While much of the criticism of PSG‚Äôs failures falls upon the man in the dugout, the entire football operation is overseen by sporting director Leonardo, who has remained immune from criticism. The Brazilian‚Äôs track record is not all positive. He has helped attract some of the game‚Äôs biggest players to the club but those players haven't always remained under control, while he has undervalued the role of the coach. Thomas Tuchel, for example, departed a year ago after falling out with Leonardo then promptly led Chelsea to the Champions League title. Analyst Rothen is one of the few willing to question the 1994 World Cup-winning midfielder's work. Examining the case of Neymar last week, he fumed: ‚ÄúHow can you accept that from a player? It‚Äôs not normal because the image of PSG still suffers from it through the bulls**t of Neymar on social media networks‚Ä¶ poker, parties, New Year. ‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôre the sporting director of one of the biggest clubs in Europe and you want to win the Champions League. You‚Äôve got the resources, no problem. But go to Germany or go to England and see how he‚Äôd go there.‚Äù The odds are increasingly being stacked against Pochettino, whose ability to direct the squad appears to grow thinner with each superstar arrival. Messi's signing in the summer should have been a blessing for Pochettino but it hasn't always been plain sailing. He, like Neymar, has too big a profile and too much support from above to be dropped, despite only one Ligue 1 goal since his arrival. PSG may perform like a big team in the transfer market, but until these internal problems are sported out, that dream of winning the Champions League may well remain just that.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/messi-psg-player-power-row/bltd027b697f6e039e4,Robin Bairner,880551df-54e6-493a-ba41-3aac718c1de7
Drogba vs Yaya Toure: Whose FA Cup semi-final impact was greater?,"Anyone who intimates that Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure carried the can for Chelsea and Manchester City in FA Cup semi-finals is unlikely to be laughed out of the room. Instead, that assertion will be accompanied by manifold nods of the head in agreement, owing to their decisive quality when the chips were down. The West London outfit and the Citizens are back at Wembley Stadium this weekend, knowing full well another FA Cup title is within reach, even though only one can claim the title. While Thomas Tuchel‚Äôs team and City have been kept apart in the last four this time around, the fact both sides made it to this stage last season and are back again circa a year later somewhat demonstrates the interest both sides have maintained in the sport‚Äôs oldest cup competition since they became dominant forces in English football. Drogba and Yaya played a significant part in supporters of both clubs cherishing the competition‚Äôs latter stages, with both sides claiming five titles altogether while the Ivorian icons represented the clubs. For the retired centre-forward, there was broadly the typical decisiveness and end product in the last four. Jose Mourinho‚Äôs Blues were favourites against Rafael Benitez‚Äôs Reds despite the bad blood between both sides following a heated, controversial Champions League semi-final the previous year. Drogba halved the deficit for the West London side with 20 minutes remaining but he could have put Chelsea in front early on but somehow missed the target having been face to face with Pepe Reina. Joe Cole‚Äôs missed effort in the game‚Äôs closing stages nearly forced the encounter at Old Trafford into extra time but it was not to be for the Blues who may have retained their league title but fell short in the cup. Drogba was the match-winner for the Blues who claimed a comeback victory over their London rivals at Wembley. The marksman raced onto a Frank Lampard ball before going past Lukasz Fabianski who had found himself in no man‚Äôs land outside his box before slotting the ball into an empty net. The Ivorian‚Äôs strike six minutes from time sealed a 2-1 success for Gus Hiddink‚Äôs team who went on to win the club‚Äôs fifth FA Cup. While the outcome suggests Carlo Ancelotti‚Äôs side had things go their way, the semi-final success over Villa was anything but straightforward. A tight contest saw John Obi Mikel lucky to not concede a first-half penalty after clumsily bringing down Gabriel Agbonlahor and a John Carew header at the start of the second just missed the far post. It was Drogba who scored a poacher‚Äôs effort to open the scoring in the 68th minute and it stayed that way before goals from Florent Malouda (89) and Lampard (90+5) added some gloss to the final score. Chelsea went on to claim the club‚Äôs first-ever double with Drogba netting a free-kick in the final against Portsmouth. Another semi-final success for the Blues in which the result perhaps flattered the West London side. Drogba opened the scoring with a brilliant left-footed effort after spinning former Chelsea teammate William Gallas.  However, Spurs could have been ahead but for a goal-line intervention from John Terry and Emmanuel Adebayor failing to connect to Rafael van der Vaart‚Äôs cross which hit the post. Further goals from Juan Mata, Ramires, Lampard and Malouda made sure Gareth Bale halving the deficit just before the hour did not move the needle as the Blues ran away comfortable winners in the end. Again, Drogba‚Äîdespite being past his prime‚Äîwas decisive in the success over Spurs and the decider against Liverpool. As for Yaya, it would be a tough ask to find a more memorable semi-final moment than the 2011 encounter at the Home of Football. Despite Wayne Rooney‚Äôs absence, the Red Devils entered that encounter as favourites to face Stoke City, but the ‚Äònoisy neighbours‚Äô had other ideas. It was Yaya who capitalised on Michael Carrick‚Äôs mistake on the edge of United‚Äôs area, powered past Nemanja Vidic and slotted the ball home to send the Citizens‚Äô supporters into raptures. That strike was enough to win the game for the blue of Manchester who made it into their first FA Cup final since 1981. Unsurprisingly, Yaya was the match-winner in the 1-0 decider over Stoke City, sealing the club‚Äôs first triumph in the competition since 1969. Even though Yaya was no longer a first-choice pick when Pep Guardiola took charge of Man City, the Spaniard trusted the midfield man against the Gunners. For a moment, it seemed the Ivorian would have the desired impact, too, winning the ball on the edge of the City box and releasing Sergio Aguero to open the scoring on the hour. However, goals from Nacho Monreal and an Alexis Sanchez winner in the first half of extra time saw the Gunners turn the game around. Pep‚Äôs troops may have felt unfortunate to fall to that defeat having seen a goal ruled out while Yaya and Fernandinho hit the woodwork in the second half. Admittedly, Drogba racked up more semi-final moments than his countryman but the importance of Manchester City‚Äôs win over United in 2011 cannot be underplayed. City at the time did not go into every competition as favourites to win it as they do now, so claiming that success over Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äôs side was colossal for the Citizens. That landmark victory over their city rivals sent them into a first final in a generation while the eventual win ended 42 years of hurt without claiming one of England‚Äôs prestigious prizes. Indeed, making a case against Yaya‚Äôs moment of brilliance in 2011 against a side they loathe will require great effort. It is arguably a non-debate.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/drogba-vs-yaya-toure-whose-fa-cup-semi-final-impact-was/blt389dbbc709935788,Seye Omidiora,cadbebb2-c126-4c51-a70a-5cee49d3c7a9

"Huddersfield Town vs Burnley: Predcitions, tips & betting odds","The new Championship season begins on Friday evening at the John Smith's stadium where Huddersfield Town host Burnley. The Clarets begin the campaign hoping to bounce back immediately from the Premier League relegation by securing an instant return to the topflight. The Terriers will certainly possess promotion aspirations of their own having coming so close last May before losing in the play-off final to Nottingham Forest. The most recent meeting between these sides came in January in the FA Cup when Huddersfield recorded a 2-1 victory at Turf Moor. The Yorkshire outfit however are outsiders for Friday's clash with bet365 offering them at 17/10 (2.70) with their opponents from Lancashire priced at 31/20 (2.55). The draw meanwhile can be backed at 23/10 (3.30). Having scored 20 goals for MK Dons in League One last season, new Burnley signing Scott Twine is among the favourites to break the deadlock, offered at 6/1 (7.00) the same the price as his teammate Ashley Barnes. Huddersfield have a new attacking signing of their own, with Jack Rudoni joining from AFC Wimbledon where he scored 12 times in 41 League One appearances and the 21-year-old is also available at 6/1 (7.00) to score first, the same price as veteran Terriers striker Jordan Rhodes. Huddersfield ended the regular season last term in spectacular fashion taking 19 points from a possible 21 to finish third in the table and head into the play-offs with real momentum. Burnley for their part battled but ended up suffering relegation after taking one point from their last four Premier League matches and their form on the road really cost them. Sean Dyche's men won just twice away from Turf Moor and they will know that record will have to improve drastically in the second tier this season under new boss Vincent Kompany. An even game is likely to be in store and there should be plenty of interest in backing a stalemate. Three of the last four league meetings between these teams have ended in draws and the price of 23/10 (3.30) for a repeat should appeal. Backing 1-1 in the correct score market at 11/2 (6.50) also looks attractive. Odds correct at the time of writing. Please gamble responsibly.

'F*ck that guy!' - Herbers slams 'pathetic' Inter Miami star Higuain,"Chicago Fire forward Fabian Herbers slammed Gonzalo Higuain, saying that the Inter Miami star is ""destructive"" due to his negative body language. Herbers' Fire faced Higuain's Miami in their respective MLS openers, with both starting in the eventual scoreless draw.

""This guy is so pathetic.

Every time there's a missed pass he's just rolling his eyes and absolutely shockingly negative."" Herbers' cohost, D.C. United star Julian Gressel, agreed with his sentiment. ""That feeling of having your leader, your captain have that type of body language and reaction towards young teammates, guys that haven't played a ton of minutes in MLS because of the budget problems and that stuff, that's definitely a red flag for me as well,"" Gressel said.  ""I don't like to lead that way and I don't think a good captain leads that way."" The Argentinian star made the move to MLS in 2020 and has scored 13 goals in 40 games. Since joining the league, Inter Miami have failed to live up to expectations and now face an uphill battle this season after being punished for violating roster rules last year.

Russia head coach Karpin: I just hope people will stop dying,"Russia head coach Valeri Karpin has called for an end to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, professing his hope that ""people will stop dying"" as he spoke out on the sanctions issued against the national team. Football sides at both national and international level have been hit hard by sanctions across the sport's governing bodies in the wake of Vladimir Putin's invasion of their neighbouring Eastern Europe nation. Among these sanctions include the suspension of Russia's participation in this month's Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers - and now their manager has made a call for peace to come soon while indicating his belief that his side may yet be able to compete again soon. ""Football is important,"" Karpin stated in a post made to social media by the Russia men's national team's channels. ""It brings us together and unites us, [and] things will be difficult without it. ""I am confident the national team and the clubs should be able to continue to play.  ""Speaking on a global scale, I just hope this will finally end, peace will come and people will stop dying.""

In addition, Russian clubs have been banned from continental competition, with Spartak Moscow forced to withdraw from the Europa League last-16, where they had been due to face RB Leipzig. When or whether any sanctions will be reversed seems unlikely given the tight timeframe before this month's matches, meaning that the 2018 World Cup hosts look set to miss out entirely on this year's tournament.

Ex-Liverpool & Ukraine forward Voronin calls Putin a 'son of a b*tch' as he quits role as Dynamo Moscow assistant after Russia invasion,"Andriy¬†Voronin has terminated his contract as assistant manager at Dynamo Moscow amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Former Liverpool striker Voronin has spent the last two years working as a number two on the Dynamo bench, having initially moved into coaching after hanging up his boots back in 2015. The 42-year-old, who also won 75 caps for Ukraine, has now left the club out of support for his country as they continue to try and fight off Russian military forces. Dynamo have released a short statement confirming Voronin's departure, which reads: ""Football club 'Dynamo' and assistant head coach Voronin reached an agreement to terminate the contract by agreement of both parties."" –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –í–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–Ω –ø–æ–∫–∏–¥–∞–µ—Ç ¬´–î–∏–Ω–∞–º–æ¬ª  –§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∫–ª—É–± ¬´–î–∏–Ω–∞–º–æ¬ª –∏ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫ –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞ –í–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–Ω –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–≥–ª–∏ —Å–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∞ –ø–æ —Å–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—é —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω. pic.twitter.com/JLuWFga8SK Voronin, meanwhile, told BILD of his decision to step down: ""I could no longer work in the country that is bombing my homeland.""

Women's FA Cup prize fund to increase to ¬£3m per year,"The prize fund for the Women's FA Cup has been increased to ¬£3 million ($4m), the Football Association (FA) has announced. The increase will come into effect in the 2022-23 campaign, with the funds being spread across each round of the competition. The commitment comes as a result of the increased profile and commercial interest in the FA Cup and the FA's desire to invest more across the women‚Äôs professional and grassroots game. The FA has promised that a disproportionate amount of the new prize money be given out in the early rounds of the competition so that teams lower in the pyramid will see the benefits of the investment. The FA's director of women‚Äôs football, Sue Campbell, said: ""I‚Äôm delighted to be able to make this announcement of increased funding for the Vitality Women‚Äôs FA Cup because it‚Äôs going to benefit so many clubs across the women‚Äôs football pyramid. ""The FA Cup, whether men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs, is the biggest and best domestic cup competition in the world, and this increased investment from The FA highlights that we want clubs competing in it to be rewarded, while also highlighting our ongoing commitment to the women‚Äôs game. ""Women‚Äôs football continues to be in a growth phase and we are always looking to make improvements and investment to drive it forward and break new boundaries. This is certainly one of the most pleasing during my time with the organisation, because I know it means so much to so many."" The quarter-finals of the 2021-22 edition of the competition will be played on March 20. Reigning champions Chelsea and runners-up Arsenal are still in contention to claim the title this year.

Is now the 'perfect time' for new Kane contract at Tottenham? Conte explains why it is,"WHAT HAPPENED? The England international striker has sparked talk of interest from Manchester rivals City and United in recent windows, but he has stayed loyal to the club that gave him a big break. He remains a prolific presence for Spurs, with 252 goals recorded for the north London outfit, and may be about to see fresh terms put to him. WHAT THEY SAID: Conte has said of efforts to tie a talismanic figure down: ""I think that my opinion is only one of one million opinions. To force the club, to tell the club, to sign a new contract for Harry Kane. Because I repeat: We are talking about a world-class striker, we are talking about a player that in this moment is the most representative player for Tottenham, no? For sure, I‚Äôd like to sign a new contract for Harry. ""The perfect time. But you know very well: you create the perfect time with a project. If also the player understands that there is a right process, and that everybody, we are going in the same direction. Every single player wants to see this. And I think Harry for sure is happy, because he is seeing this type of situation."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Kane, who is now 29 years of age, is already working on a deal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium through to the summer of 2024. Spurs are, however, understandably keen to ensure that he sees his playing days out on their books. IN THREE PHOTOS:    DID YOU KNOW? Tottenham‚Äôs Harry Kane has now scored against 31 of the 32 clubs he has appeared against in the Premier League (97%), failing only against Brentford. WHAT NEXT FOR KANE?

2022 World Cup Qualifiers: Cameroon's Song slams Algeria for defensive approach,"Cameroon coach Rigobert Song has hit out at Algeria for their defensive approach in the first leg of the 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off staged at Japoma Stadium on Friday. The North Africans scored the only goal of the game through Islam Slimani in the 40th minute to silence the home team's fans. The Indomitable Lions struggled to break down their opponents who had opted to employ a 5-2-3 system that was occasionally switched to 3-4-3 when attacking.  Song was unhappy with the approach when speaking during the post-match interview. ""Algeria did not come to play. Our players were there to play, our goal was to play. [In] football, if you put seven people behind it, it's complicated,"" Song said as quoted by Dzfoot. ""The players did what they were asked to do. We did not know how to make a difference and we lacked success. ""Playing at home is never easy... our players are coming out of [the Africa Cup of Nations] at which we dreamed of winning. [On Friday] we weren't bad."" Song was appointed to coach the Indomitable Lions in place of Toni Conceicao, who had led the team to a third-place finish at Afcon earlier this year.  The former Liverpool man has now stated it is difficult for him to make an immediate impact but went on to promise fans they will give their best away in the second leg. ""I can't change things in three days or four days, I do what is necessary, I'm a competitor, you have to stay positive. The qualification could be with them,"" Song continued. ""[At Mustapha Tchaker Stadium] in Blida, we will try to put Algeria in difficulty. I will go there for the qualification [to the World Cup]."" Algeria have now defeated Cameroon once in their last six meetings in all competitions - they have managed two draws and three losses. The second leg will be played on Tuesday, where the aggregate winner will earn qualification to represent Africa in the Fifa World Cup in Qatar later this year.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/2022-world-cup-qualifiers-cameroon-song-slams-algeria-for/blte6276b83e468317e,Seth Willis,9be4c8d2-037e-46b3-85c5-57254468c7a1
What happened to Sergio Aguero? Barcelona star's chest problem explained and will he retire?,"What happened to Sergio Aguero in Barcelona's game against Alaves? Much was expected of Aguero following his arrival at Barca in the 2021 summer transfer window, with the Argentine joining on a free transfer following his departure from Manchester City. However, his debut was delayed by a serious calf injury and he is now set for an even longer spell on the sidelines due to a health issue, but how serious is it? GOAL is here to provide you with all the details. Aguero was handed only his second start for Barca in a Liga clash with Alaves on October 30, but had to be withdrawn early after suffering from chest pains and complaining of dizziness. Barcelona coach Sergi Barjuan on Sergio Aguero: ""He told me he was a little dizzy. I have found out now that they have taken him to the hospital to see what he really has. I do not know any more.""Get well soon, @aguerosergiokun üôè pic.twitter.com/uCFBfBPpbS The 33-year-old was attended to¬†on the Camp Nou pitch by the club's medical staff before being taken to hospital for¬†cardiological tests and will be kept under observation before undergoing a course of treatment. Barca released a¬†statement confirming that Aguero will be unavailable for selection for the next three months, with a specialised rehabilitation¬†programme set to be undertaken once doctors have decided on the best approach to take with his condition.

Aguero is now set to miss around 14 games across all competitions, including La Liga encounters with Celta Vigo, Espanyol, Villarreal, Real Betis, Osasuna, Elche, Mallorca, Granada, Rayo Vallecano and Alaves. He will also sit out Barca's final two Champions League group-stage outings against Benfica and Bayern Munich, as well as a Supercopa de Espana clash with arch-rivals Real Madrid on January 12.¬† It has been suggested that Aguero could be sent into premature retirement from the game after a major health scare, which may have been the result of an as of yet undiagnosed heart condition. It is reported that he has already taken the decision to hang up his boots, with an official announcement now said to be imminent. Spanish publication Marca has reported that Aguero will confirm his retirement on Wednesday, December 15. The former City star has previously said that he is waiting on ""more news"" when it comes to making a long-term recovery. Aguero previously said in a video posted on Barcelona's social media channels: ""Hey Culers! Sending you all a hug. Thank you for all the messages of support! Now it‚Äôs time to recover and wait for more news. We are with you, @aguerosergiokun üíô‚ù§Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/jM4peDk6a7 ""Pep Guardiola, who managed Aguero for five years at Man City, has urged the Argentine to put his health first with regards to any decision on his future in football. ""We wish him well from all the people here at Manchester City, we wish him a safe recovery,"" Guardiola told a press conference while addressing Aguero's hospital admission. ""The time doesn‚Äôt matter. Health and life are much more important than anything else. ‚ÄúWe wish him as speedy and safe recovery as possible and he comes back, if possible, to play again, otherwise to enjoy his life and what he has done, and to be careful and be safe for the rest of his life.‚Äù Aguero is not the only player to see his career put on hold by a chest or heart issue, with the other most recent example coming in the form of Christian Eriksen's sudden collapse at Euro 2020. The Inter and Denmark midfielder stopped breathing after suffering cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the pitch before being rushed to hospital, where it was eventually confirmed that he would need to be fitted with an¬†implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba, meanwhile, was forced to hang up his boots early after a similar incident during an FA Cup clash with Tottenham in 2012, with doctors subsequently revealing that he was lucky to be alive after his heart stopped beating for 78 minutes. Real Madrid legend and ex-Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas also retired after suffering a heart attack while in training at Porto in 2019, with the Spaniard announcing his decision a year later at the age of 39. There is hope that Aguero can return to the pitch, though, with Ajax and Netherlands star Daley Blind still going strong at the age of 31 after being fitted with an ICD two years ago and ex-Stuttgarter Kickers player Daniel Engelbrecht having resumed his career¬†after an on-field heart attack in 2013.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-happened-sergio-aguero-barcelona-stars-chest-problem/19o5twhzr5y191soncg3mkx1k8,James Westwood,75d10667-29af-4605-bf4b-89d1d91af408
Explained: Why Bale was absent from Real Madrid La Liga title celebrations,"Real Madrid secured their 35th La Liga title on Saturday, doing so in style with four games to spare. Carlo Ancelotti's side wrapped things up in front of home support, emphatically beating Espanyol 4-0 to usher the trophy into their hands. The victory prompted scenes of elation at Santiago Bernabeu, but one player was notable for his absence: Gareth Bale. So why was the attacker not present? GOAL brings you the details. Bale missed Real Madrid's title celebrations because he was suffering from a back spasm. The Wales international explained why he wasn't there in a Twitter post, writing: ""So disappointed that I'm not able to be part of the celebrations this evening due to a bad back spasm but really proud of the team for winning the title! Enjoy the night boys!"" CAMPEONES üèÜüí™üèº So disappointed that I‚Äôm not able to be part of the celebrations this evening due to a bad back spasm but really proud of the team for winning the title! Enjoy tonight boys! #HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/RbXttKwHSE Bale has won La Liga three times during his nine-year spell at Santiago Bernabeu, while also helping the club to four Champions League titles in that period. However, he has found himself on the periphery in recent seasons. Indeed, the 32-year-old has featured just five times in the league in 2021-22, with only two appearances from the bench in the Champions League. Despite his contributions since joining from Tottenham in 2013-14, Bale has been subjected to his share of criticism in Spain, with the disparaging nickname 'Golfer' infamously applied to a former ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£84m/$105m) player. He endures a mixed relationship with the Madrid support too, with jeers being a frequent feature in the Bernabeu stands, and team-mates have felt compelled to defend him. ""When one player is whistled at, we all get whistled at. I don't agree when this happens,"" Casemiro told a press conference in April 2022.  ""We have to support him. I don't like the way Bale was whistled the other day because he is a historic player for this club. When you whistle at a player like that you whistle at the history of this club."" Bale's time at Real Madrid is set to conclude in the summer, but it remains unclear where the decorated veteran will transfer to. He will be available on a free transfer and a number of clubs have been linked, including Serie A giants AC MIlan, his former club Tottenham and even Championship outfit Cardiff City.

Toney risks Brentford fan wrath again with 'nowhere exciting' reply to where he plays,"Ivan Toney has risked the wrath of Brentford fans once again by replying ""nowhere exciting"" in response to being asked where he currently plays. Toney quickly established himself as a cult hero among the Brentford faithful after joining the club from Peterborough in August 2020. The English striker hit 31 Championship goals in his debut season to fire Thomas Frank's side to promotion, and has been impressive in the Premier League, but his off-field attitude has not always been quite as endearing. Brentford fans turned on Toney after a video showing him disrespecting the club went viral in January. The 26-year-old was heard saying ""f*ck Brentford"" in a clip recorded while he was on holiday in Dubai during the winter break. Toney subsequently issued an apology, writing on Twitter: ""I am aware of a video of me that was published on social media. In it, I used language that was unacceptable.  ""The video was cut short and edited but I have to accept the impact this has had and realise I should not have put myself in that position. I want to apologise to all Brentford fans."" Toney has now appeared in a short Q&A with TikTok star 'callmetoksy', who has built up a large following by interviewing celebrities in their cars. The forward was first asked what he does for a living, to which he responded: ""I'm a professional footballer."" He opened himself up to more criticism with his reply to the next question as he was asked where he currently plays. Toney replied ""nowhere exciting"" and laughed before putting his thumb up to the interviewer as the video ended. The former Peterborough starlet, who has 11 Premier League goals to his name this season, was named in Brentford's latest squad for their trip to Leicester City.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/toney-risks-brentford-wrath-again-nowhere-exciting-reply/blt5a4f05cfae5c07c4,James Westwood,91a938af-c9c7-4323-aac8-e074f93ca522
"'Important' Dest could start for Barcelona against Frankfurt following injury lay-off, says Xavi","Barcelona coach Xavi confirmed that Sergino Dest was in the running to start Thursday's Europa League quarter-final against Eintracht Frankfurt following a prolonged injury absence.  The USMNT star has not featured for his side since mid-March after being laid low with a muscle complaint.  But he has made Xavi's squad for the second against Frankfurt, with the tie poised at 1-1 following last week's opener. ‚ÄúHe is on the squad list, and definitely has a chance to start,"" the coach told reporters in Wednesday's press conference. ""Same for Memphis [Depay].

'Koeman lied to me' - Leeds star Firpo slams ex-Barcelona boss for disrespecting him at Camp Nou,"Leeds star Junior Firpo has slammed former Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman for what he saw as disrepsect towards him and a number of other first team players during his time at Camp Nou. Firpo initially joined Barca from Real Betis in August 2019, and went on to appear in 41 games across all competitions for the club, scoring two goals. The talented full-back saw his playing time reduced when Koeman took charge ahead of the 2020-21 campaign, though, and ended up joining Leeds for ‚Ç¨15 million (¬£13m/$18m) in the summer. Koeman was sacked by Barca three months after Firpo's departure amid a poor run of results, and the former Spain U21 international has now opened up on his struggles under the Dutchman. ‚ÄúI asked Koeman for explanations why I was not playing until one day he started to lie to me,"" Firpo has told SER Catalunya. ""At that point, when the coach starts to lie to you, you realise they‚Äôre misleading you‚Ä¶ Why keep asking for explanations if at the end of the day they‚Äôre going to mislead you time and again? ‚ÄúHe lied to me because he said things that made no sense, that I was training badly, contaminating the group. Things like that. You can ask anyone at the club at the time and they will agree with me."" The Leeds defender added on Koeman's regular absence from training sessions: ""There was a lack of respect, not just to me but to other players. I will never understand that, after a game, when the substitutes train the next day, Koeman stayed in his office while we were training. ‚ÄúIf I have to show to you that I deserve to play and you don‚Äôt pick me‚Ä¶ the only way I can show that is in training. When the whole team trains it is tougher, there are a lot more of us, we do quick exercises and they‚Äôre tired after playing a game. ‚ÄúThe day that I have to prove I should play and want to play is the day after the game when the substitutes train hard‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre not there.‚Äù Barca moved quickly to appoint club legend Xavi as Koeman's permanent successor at the start of November. Xavi inherited a side that had slipped to ninth in the Liga standings, and has managed to guide them up to seventh after winning two of his first three domestic matches. However, Barca exited the Champions League at the group stage for the first time since 2003-04 after a 3-0 loss to Bayern Munich on Wednesday, and will now have to compete in the Europa League.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/koeman-lied-to-me-leeds-star-firpo-slams-ex-barcelona-boss/blt172ad22f38953336,James Westwood,d0714ff2-cd21-49e2-8128-942b389808a7
Man City the big winners as Covid-hit Liverpool slip up in Tottenham thriller,"Was this the day the tide turned in the Premier League title race? As Manchester City enjoyed a Sunday stroll on Tyneside, Chelsea stuttered in the west Midlands and Liverpool came unstuck after a chaotic clash in north London. What an afternoon it was at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Breathless, relentless, dramatic and controversial. English football at its best, some might say. In the end, Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs team may see their 2-2 draw as a point gained rather than two dropped. They certainly had to dig deep into those energy reserves, that ‚Äòmonster‚Äô mentality to ensure they left with a share of the spoils. Heavily depleted, without their entire first-choice midfield and with a 19-year-old making his first league start in the anchor role, the Reds rode their luck at times and cursed their luck at others. There will not have been many fingernails left unchewed in the away end, that‚Äôs for sure. They finished with 10 men, Andy Robertson shown a straight red card for lashing out at Emerson Royal just eight minutes after giving his side the lead at 2-1. They will, though, wonder how Harry Kane escaped the same punishment for a wild lunge on Robertson in the first half.  England captain privileges, perhaps? Klopp also felt, with some justification, his team should have had a penalty when Royal barged Diogo Jota over before half-time. No VAR check for that, which felt strange to say the least. It looked blatant. Jota had headed Liverpool level, his 10th league goal of the season cancelling out Kane‚Äôs well-crafted opener. Tottenham caused the visitors tons of problems with their counterattacks, and Kane, Son Heung-min and Dele Alli all might have extended the lead before Liverpool, as they always do, struck back. When Robertson netted, reacting well to head in Trent Alexander-Arnold‚Äôs volleyed cross from close range, there were 21 minutes to go and a massive win was in sight. But then Alisson Becker, who made a string of outstanding saves, missed his challenge as he slid out at the feet of Son, who gleefully levelled into an empty net. Then came Robertson‚Äôs moment of madness, the red card awarded after referee Paul Tierney was advised to check his pitchside monitor. No real complaints there, other than the decisions which had preceded it. Tierney and his team had an afternoon to forget. Liverpool held out for the draw, though might have stolen the win when Kostas Tsimikas was unable to pick out Mo Salah in injury time. Salah‚Äôs run of scoring or assisting in 15 Premier League games in a row is over, by the way. The Egyptian endured a rare frustrating afternoon. And so Liverpool head into Christmas three points behind City, and having seen their considerable goal difference advantage wiped out in the space of a week.¬† Of more concern, though, is the impact of coronavirus on Klopp's squad heading into the festive period. Thiago Alcantara joined Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Curtis Jones in testing positive over the weekend, while Jordan Henderson was sent home from London with a cold (the Reds captain returned a negative test on Sunday). Klopp said Liverpool wanted to play, and the club have been transparent in their communications about positive Covid tests, but with Leeds United to come on Boxing Day followed by Leicester away on December 28, and then the prospect of a trip to Chelsea early in the New Year, surely things are only going to get worse before they get better. Whether the Premier League will act remains to be seen - there is a meeting of clubs scheduled for Monday, at which a 'firebreak' will surely feature high on the agenda - but for now one thing is for sure. The big winners of this weekend play in light blue and come from the Etihad Stadium.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-big-winners-covid-liverpool-slip-tottenham-thriller/blta118b87fc59278f1,Neil Jones,ab4d562b-bbf8-4997-a3a9-1b2a62056c14
Nicolas Pepe: How Arsenal's record signing turned into a ¬£72m nightmare,"Nicolas Pepe is on his way out of Arsenal. The club‚Äôs record signing, who cost ¬£72m ($85m) when they bought him from Lille just three years ago, is closing in on a return to France after Arsenal agreed a loan deal with Nice for the winger. Talks have been ongoing between the two clubs over the exact make-up of the deal, with Pepe left out of Mikel Arteta's squad for the 3-0 win at Bournemouth in the Premier League as negotiations continued. And an agreement for a season-long loan, which does not include an option to buy, has now been reached for the 27-year-old. So why are Arsenal happy to let a player leave who just three years ago they were willing to smash their transfer record for?

Bayern Munich make ‚Ç¨25m Gravenberch bid as they move ahead of Manchester United for Ajax star,"Bayern Munich have made a ‚Ç¨25 million (¬£21m/$28m) bid for Ryan Gravenberch to move ahead of Manchester United in the race to sign the Ajax star, GOAL and Voetbalzone can confirm. Gravenberch has attracted high profile admirers across Europe since breaking into the Ajax first team at just 16 in 2018, showing off his talents in both Eredivisie and Champions League. Man Utd and Real Madrid have been among those credited with an interest in the Netherlands international, but Bayern have made the first move to secure his services ahead of the summer transfer window. The German champions have submitted an opening offer for Gravenberch, whose contract with Ajax is due to expire in June 2023. GOAL and Voetbalzone have learned Bayern's opening bid came in ‚Ç¨10m below Ajax's ‚Ç¨35m (¬£29m/$39m) asking price, but they are hopeful the Eredivisie club will be willing to compromise in order to avoid losing the 19-year-old on a free transfer next year. Gravenberch is flattered by Bayern's interest and open to a move to Allianz Arena, where he would see his current salary demands met. Gravenberch addressed the speculation surrounding his future last month, insisting he won't run his contract at Johan Cruyff ArenA down because of his respect for the club. The Ajax midfielder did however admit that he is ""ready"" to move onto a bigger challenge.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bayern-gravenberch-bid-man-utd-ajax/blt16434597fe996343,GOAL,482d7218-0d6b-4eec-80ac-6d4d17f94c9a
Lewandowski 'has better chance of joining Barcelona' claims Laporta,"Joan Laporta has said Robert Lewandowski ""has a better chance"" of joining Barcelona in response to a fan asking about a potential move for the Bayern Munich star. Lewandowski has spent the last eight years at Bayern, but his current contract is due to expire in 2023. GOAL has reported the German champions will open extension talks with the 33-year-old before the season ends, but he could depart this summer if an agreement is not reached with Barca among those being linked with a swoop. The Spanish giants are also thought to be interested in Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland, but his reported ‚Ç¨30 million-per-year salary demands are likely to prove too steep. Laporta has insisted Barca won't exceed La Liga's wage restrictions as they continue to try and balance the books following a record-breaking year of debt in 2021. Lewandowski could be a much cheaper option given his age, and the Blaugrana president has now confirmed he is a realistic target. A fan stopped Laporta after spotting him in public this week and asked: ""Joan, is Lewandowski coming or not?"" The Camp Nou chief replied: ""This one has a better chance of coming, yes.""  Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn has confirmed they are eager to tie Lewandowski down to a new contract. However, Kahn also admits the Poland international may take some persuading to stay at Allianz Arena given he has already won seven Bundesliga titles and the Champions League while breaking scoring records with the club. ""As of today, Robert has a contract with us for next season,"" Kahn said earlier this month. ""We are in contact with Robert and want him to stay at Bayern for as long as possible. ""Apparently, some believe that such talks and contract negotiations are just like an online manager game, where I click on something and he then extends his contract. You also have to look at the situation of the players. ""Players who have performed well at this club for many years are outstanding. Robert became a world-class footballer with us. Robert is a player who has the potential to score 30 to 40 goals every year.  ""Of course, at some point, players like this get the idea that 'I've achieved everything here and won everything'. Then it takes time to convince him to stay here.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/lewandowski-chance-of-joining-barcelona-laporta/blt266a788b158617fd,James Westwood,e1d7a9cb-9361-480d-9a07-22fe04f7dc19
Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid transfer: La Liga side have plan on when to announce signing of PSG star,"Real Madrid are still confident about signing Kylian Mbappe and plan to announce a deal at the end of the season, GOAL can confirm. Mbappe pushed for a move to Santiago Bernabeu last summer, only for Paris Saint-Germain to reject three lucrative offers from Madrid. The French club managed to hold onto the 23-year-old for the final year of his contract, but there has been no sign of an extension being agreed and, as it stands, he will become a free agent at the end of June. PSG have submitted multiple renewal offers to Mbappe already, but he is currently refusing to commit his long-term future to the club. GOAL understands that Mbappe gave Madrid his word that he would join them in a year's time after the proposed transfer fell through in 2021. The Spanish giants are relaxed about the situation and expect him to arrive at Santiago Bernabeu ahead of the 2022-23 campaign. Madrid are in no rush, though, and will wait until the current season is over before officially confirming terms for Mbappe in order to avoid any disruption to Carlo Ancelotti's existing group as they continue to chase silverware on multiple fronts. Mbappe scored a stunning winner for PSG as they beat Madrid 1-0 in the first leg of their Champions League round of 16 tie last week. The World Cup winner insisted he has not yet made a decision on his future after the contest and explained how he has avoided becoming distracted by the constant transfer talk away from the pitch. ""It‚Äôs easy, you have to play football,"" he told Movistar. ""We ask too many questions, we say too many things. We talk about PSG and Real, two big clubs.  ""I‚Äôm a PSG player, I‚Äôm always very happy.‚Äù It remains to be seen what Mbappe's next move will be, but La Liga president Javier Tebas has insisted that Madrid will definitely be the only club in the running for the forward if he does leave Parc des Princes. ""Madrid will get Mbappe and Haaland as the others [Barcelona and Juventus] are ruined [financially],"" Tebas said earlier this month. ""That Mbappe comes is great news for La Liga. It would be a joy for La Liga. It's the best thing that could happen to La Liga.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/kylian-mbappe-real-madrid-transfer-when-announce-signing-psg/blt82dd44a7126248db,GOAL,f27aaef6-6ac5-4637-8868-12485053a659
"Di Maria to Juventus would be like Maradona in Serie A, claims Buffon","Gianluigi Buffon has claimed that Angel Di Maria would be ‚Äúlike Diego Maradona‚Äù in Serie A if the Argentine forward were to move to Italy as a free agent. A 34-year-old South American forward finds himself without a club after reaching the end of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain. Buffon spent one season working with Di Maria in France in 2018-19 and believes the former Real Madrid and Manchester United winger has the ability to become another talismanic presence in the Italian top-flight ‚Äì much like a compatriot who once starred for Napoli. Legendary goalkeeper Buffon told Gazzetta dello Sport: ‚ÄúRight now, Di Maria in Serie A, is like Maradona. Am I clear? ‚ÄúFootballers must be valued considering the context where they play. Today Serie A is technically poorer and Angel has so much technique. ‚ÄúHe is decisive in front of goal, he dribbles past his opponents so easily. He is good at delivering assists and runs up and down on the pitch. He can play in different roles. In a few words: he is a football player.‚Äù 18 trophies in seven years üèÜWhat a servant Angel Di Maria has been for PSG. pic.twitter.com/Ej0sN5abbH While plenty of interest has been shown in Di Maria, there is no escaping the fact that he is past his peak. Buffon does not consider that to be an issue for any suitors, with the 2006 World Cup winner still going strong with Parma well beyond his 40th birthday. ‚ÄúI am 44, but I still play,‚Äù Buffon added. ‚ÄúAge doesn‚Äôt matter. Motivation and passion are much more important and the same goes for determination. If Di Maria joins Juventus, it means that he‚Äôs ready to do so. ‚ÄúWe are talking of an exemplary professional, a nice guy, one who never gives up and fights during games and training sessions. I repeat, for today‚Äôs Serie A, he‚Äôd be like Maradona. ‚ÄúAt PSG, I played with Neymar, a young Kylian Mbappe, Marco Verratti, but Di Maria was not inferior to any of them. ‚ÄúWhen he won the Decima at Madrid in 2014, he was playing with Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. He was always a step back but knew how to play as a winger, attacking midfielder and even mezzala. ‚ÄúWhoever signs him, and I hope it‚Äôs Juve, makes a deal.

Man City-linked Haaland to make transfer decision in 'next week' as Kehl admits he 'wouldn't be surprised' if Dortmund star leaves,"Erling Haaland will have ""clarity"" on his future next week, according to Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl, who has admitted that he will not be surprised if the forward departs this summer. Haaland has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester City in recent weeks, with the Premier League champions thought to be at the head of a clutch of major suitors keen to add the Norway international to their ranks. There has been no official call on the star's next steps, and he remains under contract with Dortmund - but with a release clause ready to be triggered this summer if required, Kehl admits that he expects to know about the player's choice sooner rather than later. ""[I expect] clarity in the next week,"" Keh told STAHLWERK Doppelpass on SPORT1 when quizzed on the Leeds-born star's future. ""I wouldn't be surprised if he moved on in the end."" Kehl also commented on moves to bring in Karim Adeyemi as a successor to Jadon Sancho, with the director adding of the RB Salzburg star: ""I assume that we will make progress with Karim this week."" As part of the contract the forward signed under late agent Mino Raiola, Haaland can depart Dortmund at the end of the season if a club meets the ‚Ç¨75 million (¬£64m/$79m) clause to release him from the Bundesliga outfit. For a player whose reputation has only soared in recent years, it represents something of a potential bargain buy from the German club, and has led to a number of interested parties, including La Liga champions Real Madrid. But City remain the heavy favourites to win the race as they seek to bring the BVB talisman back to the country of his birth.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-city-linked-haaland-to-make-transfer-decision-in-next/bltde777a56ef609bd8,Andrew Steel,ba2ca63b-8596-4f66-ba04-ed5090756ce9
Lionel Messi's La Liga debut for Barcelona - Who were his team-mates and where are they now?,"Lionel Messi, an FC Barcelona youth product, was promoted to the senior team during the 2004-05¬†season and he made his La Liga debut for the club on October 16, 2004, against city rivals Espanyol. The Argentine came on as a substitute replacing Deco in the 82nd minute of the match. At the age of 17 years and three months, Messi¬†became¬†the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. Although Messi had played for the Barcelona senior team a year before against FC Porto, it was a friendly tie between the two clubs and not an official game. The Argentine's debut La Liga match has two¬†unusual India connections. Former FC Goa defender Carlos Pena was in the matchday squad but did not feature in the match. Also, former Bengaluru FC and Hyderabad FC coach Albert Roca was a part of Frank Rijkaard's coaching team when Messi played his first game. Since the Espanyol tie in 2004, Messi appeared in a total of 520 La Liga matches donning the Barcelona shirt. He also became the most-capped Barcelona player of all time with 778 matches under his belt.

How much prize money do the Champions League 2021-22 winners get?,"Champions League financial rewards form a major part of the season-to-season plans of the biggest clubs in the world. Simply reaching the group stage of UEFA's premier club competition is worth millions and can change the fortunes of a smaller club overnight. The overall prize handed out¬†depends, of course, on how many games a team wins and how¬†far they manage to get. So, how much prize money will the winners and runners-up¬†of the 2021-22 competition win? GOAL brings you everything you need to know. Winning the Champions League final is worth ‚Ç¨20 million (¬£17m/$22m) and, while losing the final may sting,¬†the runner-up receives ‚Ç¨15.5 million (¬£13m/$17m) to soften the blow. The overall prize money given to the winner is much more than that, however, as rewards are accumulated each round depending on performance. Based on the most recent figures, a single victory in the group stage is worth ‚Ç¨2.8 million (¬£2.4m/$3m) and a draw is worth ‚Ç¨930,000 (¬£783k/$1m). If a team competes from the group stage on and wins every match in the group stage then proceeds to win the entire competition, then they'll earn a total of ‚Ç¨69.8 million (¬£59m/$77m)¬†in prize money. There is also TV revenue to be taken into account for those gracing the grandest of continental competitions. That pot is estimated to be worth around ‚Ç¨292 million (¬£246m/$323m), which is divided up between the teams involved based on their proportional market value and previous performances. When those earnings are added to the winnings of an ultimately successful side, then they start to pull in over ‚Ç¨85 million (¬£72m/$94m). The winners of the Champions League, along with victors in the Europa League, also secure a spot in the UEFA Super Cup final. Qualification for that contest is worth ‚Ç¨3.5 million (¬£3m/$4m), while the team that goes on to lift the trophy is rewarded with a further ‚Ç¨1 million (¬£842k/$1.1m).",https://www.goal.com/en/news/how-much-prize-money-champions-league-2020-21-winners-get/1hkpcgs22bt851tusgowvd71rn,Ryan Kelly,106100c0-6732-4937-b4c6-938e5b908fea

Caf Confederation Cup: Simba SC‚Äôs Gonzalez to Orlando Pirates - Even PSG will get same hospitality,"Simba SC Barbara Gonzalez has maintained they are perturbed by claims made by Orlando Pirates co-coach Mandla Ncikazi in which he claimed they were mistreated during their Caf Confederation Cup game against Simba SC at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on Sunday. Wekundu wa Msimbazi took a slim advantage in the quarter-final first leg meeting after securing a 1-0 victory courtesy of a penalty converted by defender Shomari Kapombe. However, after the game, Ncikazi described their treatment in the East African nation as akin to animals, but Simba‚Äôs Gonzalez has come out to claim they will lodge an official complaint with Caf over the allegations.  ‚ÄúIf you want to play mind games I would like to ask him to keep my country out of his mouth and also my team,‚Äù Gonzalez said as quoted by KickOff. ‚ÄúNo such things happened and even if PSG would like to come, they will be treated with the same hospitality. But for someone to go as far as saying Simba was abusive or didn‚Äôt give them support and was hostile, was absolutely incorrect. ‚ÄúAll the support that was required was given and Simba has never been a bad host. We want to take this further. I want to use this as a teachable moment. ‚ÄúThere are people you can mess with and try to play some psychological games with and I understand there are some fears over job security on his side and the technical team at Orlando Pirates. ‚ÄúBut this is not the right way to save their jobs and this is not the right way to speak of each other.‚Äù Gonzalez further said the comments by Ncikazi have already instilled fear in the Tanzanian champions as they prepare to head to South Africa for the return leg on April 24. ‚ÄúAs CEO of Simba, I don‚Äôt accept it as a citizen of Tanzania and I don‚Äôt accept this and for this reason, I am going to file a strong complaint. So I would like to see Pirates and also the government address this because it puts us in a tricky predicament,‚Äù Gonzalez continued. ‚ÄúIt also creates a lot of fear heading to South Africa. We know that there is a high crime rate and we understand the challenges South Africans are facing at the moment so you start to question the kind of treatment that you may or may not receive. ‚ÄúI am deeply concerned and worried.‚Äù The return leg will be staged at Orlando Stadium on Sunday.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/caf-confederation-cup-simba-sc-s-gonzalez-to-orlando-pirates/blt1d1cba5bb76675a6,Dennis Mabuka,27b0f150-fe63-4f79-ab02-67109f7e58a1
'You're not right!' - Laporta fires back at Neville in De Jong pay-cut row as Man Utd transfer remains possible,"Joan Laporta has issued a reply to Gary Neville after his comments about Frenkie de Jong needing to take a pay cut. The Barcelona president was unimpressed by the former Manchester United defender's comments and although he claims he wants the Dutchman to stay, he wouldn't rule out a transfer to the Red Devils. De Jong's future remains up in the air. Manchester United have been interested in signing him all summer although have yet to agree a deal with the Catalans, with De Jong having insisted that he would prefer to stay at Barca. Indeed, the Catalans would like to retain De Jong, although have requested that he takes a pay cut - something that many of his team-mates have already done. In an interview with CBS Sports, Laporta reiterated that he wants De Jong to remain at Camp Nou, although he kept the door ajar for United to potentially complete a transfer. He said: ""The first thing to say is we want Frenkie to stay at Barcelona. We love the player and him as a human being. I want him to stay in Barcelona. He's a high-quality player and a good guy. I also know that he wants to stay."" Asked what would happen if De Jong refused to lower his salary, Laporta added: ""Then he will continue. He has a contract. We will respect that decision. For us, he's a Barcelona player. We count on him. ""In football, you never know. I can't say categorically [he won't join Manchester United]. It all depends on the different parties. But in principle, I can say there is a strong possibility he stays, and I can say as president I will do my best for him to stay at Barcelona."" Laporta also denied that he'd offered De Jong to Chelsea. On the issue of a pay cut, with Ousmane Dembele having been the latest to slash his salary in order to continue at Camp Nou, Laporta added: ""All we are doing with Frenkie is the same as the rest of the squad. ""The signings coming in have adjusted their salary to the new structure. But Frenkie has a contract and we respect that. We can't force him to take a pay cut. It's his decision. ""We are trying to manage the football club in a prudent and sustainable way. So we have to have these talks and we do so in a calm and considerate way. ""We have explained the situation and are grateful to any players who can help us. It was the same with Dembele and I am very grateful to him. And after months of talks, he accepted a renegotiation of his salary and he can be proud of his decision. ""The club has a payroll that's 40% higher than our competitors. We have to reduce this and it's not easy. But the players we are talking about - who have taken pay cuts - all love Barca.  ""They reduced their salaries for the love of the club. All the players, new and old, understand the constraints. And they want to be artists who bring Barcelona back. They are aware they can be part of one of the most splendorous periods in the club's history."" Manchester United legend Gary Neville has expressed his outrage at Barca on multiple occasions in recent times, taking issue with their treatment of De Jong. Indeed, Neville, who has called the Liga side a ""disgrace"", even urged the Dutchman to take legal action against his club amid a pay dispute that has resulted in De Jong being owed ¬†‚Ç¨17 million (¬£14.5m/$17m) in deferred salary payments. Offering a reply to Neville, Laporta said: ""No answer. I respect his opinion. But in my opinion, he's not right because I insist we are respecting all our players. We follow the contracts. If we invest in new players it's to make the club more competitive. ""It's a circle. You invest in new players, the fans engage and that in turn improves our economy. Gary has been a very good football player for Manchester United. I respect his opinion and that's all I have to say.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/laporta-neville-de-jong-pay-cut-row-transfer-man-utd/bltcf7ff501f9152627,Ritabrata Banerjee,7499ed81-1661-4322-8787-9759782f0eb8
Liverpool's Salah will be desperate to put Champions League final vs Real Madrid to bed - Carragher,"Former England defender Jamie Carragher insists Liverpool winger Mohamed Salah will be looking for 'revenge' when the team plays Real Madrid in the Uefa Champions League final on May 28 in Paris.  The English side sealed their place in the final with a 5-2 aggregate semi-final win over Villarreal while Los Blancos eliminated Manchester City with a 6-5 aggregate score. It will be a repeat of the 2018 final when the two teams met and the Spanish heavyweights won 3-1. In that match, the Egypt captain was forced off with injury early after a cynical challenge by Sergio Ramos. ""Mo Salah will want revenge, 100%. It was a massive blow for Salah himself,"" Carragher told CBS Sports. ""For him, he‚Äôd just come alive that season and everyone knew what he was about. He got over 40 goals and that was going to be his moment. ""Ramos definitely knew what he was doing. You talk about the dark arts of football and there‚Äôs probably nobody as bad. It‚Äôs part of football but he pushes it to the limit."" Ramos has since joined PSG and will not be available for Real Madrid, although the majority of players who featured in that match remain at their respective clubs and should feature once again. ""Ramos won‚Äôt be involved but Mo Salah will be desperate to put that final to bed. To be honest, a lot of that team ‚Äì I‚Äôm thinking of the midfield, I‚Äôm sure that night it was [Luka] Modric, [Toni] Kroos and Casemiro ‚Äì I think that will be the midfield again,"" Carragher continued. ""So even from Liverpool‚Äôs point of view there‚Äôs still a lot of players from that team ‚Äì virtually the whole back four really, obviously not the goalkeeper.

The 34-year-old suggested following Friday's qualifying win over Venezuela that he could call time on his international career after the 2022 World Cup. Messi said he has to ""rethink a lot of things"" after the tournament in Qatar and could opt to quit the national team. Asked at a press conference about the player's comments on Sunday, Scaloni admitted that the day will eventually come when Messi decides to retire.  ‚ÄúAfter playing in a World Cup, everyone makes assessments. I‚Äôm not in the heads of the players to know what they‚Äôre thinking,"" he said. ""In any case, you have to enjoy it. You don‚Äôt have to think about the future, enjoy their spectacular present. ""It‚Äôs the rule of life and at some point it will happen. It‚Äôs useless to think about what will happen after the World Cup."" Fellow Argentina star Angel Di Maria made it clear that he does not expect his career with the national team to continue beyond the World Cup. The Paris Saint-Germain player wrote in a post on Instagram that he has likely played his final home game for Argentina after they beat Venezuela in World Cup qualifying. Di Maria played a crucial role in the 3-0 victory, scoring one goal and assisting another, and Scaloni says it was the perfect way to say goodbye to the home fans. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see the post but I understood it as being about this team, I would imagine,"" he said.  ""I spoke with him some time ago. That it‚Äôs the decision of the coach [for him to stop playing] and not them that leave us. There is an age for everyone, many trips have passed and matches, which I would imagine is difficult. ""I hope he said that about this year. I don‚Äôt know what is going on in his head. If it was the last, it could not have been any better. It came out like he would have dreamed it.  ""He put in the effort to be there and it‚Äôs very difficult that someone else would have played it or been available.

Bafana Bafana ‚Äòresult not so important‚Äô says Broos,"Bafana Bafana head coach Hugo Broos was pleased with the performance his men gave him in their 0-0 draw with Guinea in an international friendly. Had the likes of Evidence Makgopa, Lyle Foster and Keagan Dolly been more clinical, Bafana could well have claimed the spoils, and certainly Bafana custodian Veli Mothwa was the quieter of the two goalkeepers. ""It was a good performance, we asked that of the players, because these are two friendly games. The result was not so important, even if we liked to win today,"" Broos told the media after the match in his home country. ""But okay, I think that my team played a very good game. We had six, seven chances. So when there was a team that has to win the game today, it was South Africa.‚Äù Broos, who previously won the Afcon tournament with Cameroon, felt that his side did lack in one area of the game on Friday night. ""We have a little problem, when we see the tall guys of Guinea - that was sometimes a problem with the aerial duels,‚Äù he pointed out. ""But our football level, I think we played a very good game. I am very happy with the performance."" While Bafana were relatively close to full strength, bar injured Al Ahly striker Percy Tau, Guinea coach Kaba Diawara revealed that his team was somewhat of a makeshift one. ""We are just meeting the players one, two days before the game, so we don't have enough time to work,‚Äù  Diawara explained. ""We had a lot of injuries to players. With that kind of condition, we are very happy to draw today. ""We also give the first selection (debut) for four or five players of Guinea, so for them it was very important to not lose.‚Äù Next up for Broos and his men is France ‚Äì Bafana take on the World Cup champions on Monday night at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Villeneuve d'Ascq, France.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/bafana-bafana-result-not-so-important-says-broos/bltab18b6ef15ceb878,Anthony McLennan,4080ccfe-b4cc-4533-a5ec-8fa0ef982a53
Afcon 2021: Salah not taking penalty for Egypt is madness ‚Äì Carragher,"Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher believes Egypt were wrong not to assign Mohamed Salah among the first penalty takers against Senegal in their 4-2 penalty shootout final defeat at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The 29-year-old forward was not able to take his penalty after Chelsea‚Äôs Edouard Mendy had denied Mohanad Lasheen, leaving the stage for his Liverpool compatriot Sadio Mane to convert the decisive penalty and hand the Lions of Teranga their first-ever Afcon title. After the game ended 0-0 in regular and extra time, it was the Pharaohs who missed the first penalty when centre-back Mohamed Abdelmonem saw his effort hit the left-hand upright  - but their outstanding Egypt goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal immediately denied Bouna Sarr. Lasheen then saw his effort saved by Mendy, who was named the goalkeeper of the tournament, and Mane, who had missed an earlier penalty from open play, then won it with an emphatic finish into the bottom left-hand corner. Salah had been preserved to take the last penalty for the Pharaohs but according to the 44-year-old Carragher, who managed 508 appearances for the Reds, ‚Äúyour best penalty taker should never go fifth.‚Äù That is why your best penalty taker should never go fifth. Mo Salah not taking a penalty for Egypt in a shootout in a final is madness. Also happened to Ronaldo years ago for Portugal v Spain. #AFCON2021 #SENEGY ‚ÄúThat is why your best penalty taker should never go fifth,‚Äù Carragher wrote on his social media pages. ‚ÄúSalah not taking a penalty for Egypt in a shootout in a final is madness.‚Äù Carragher also compared the scene at Olembe Stadium in Yaounde to the 2012 European Championships when Cristiano Ronaldo was earmarked to take the fifth penalty for Portugal during their 3-2 defeat against Spain. However, the Manchester United player could not take the penalty as Bruno Alves saw his effort rattle the woodwork and Cesc Fabregas then stepped up to score and send Spain to the final at the expense of Ronaldo‚Äôs Portugal. ‚ÄúAlso happened to Ronaldo years ago for Portugal versus Spain,‚Äù Carragher continued. Mane‚Äôs penalty kick ensured Senegal finally laid their hands on the Afcon title after making 16 appearances in the competition. Senegal had reached two finals ‚Äì in 2002 when they lost 3-2 on penalties against Cameroon and in 2019 when they suffered a 1-0 defeat against Algeria.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-salah-not-taking-penalty-egypt-final-madness/blt70cc1d08ea850a1d,Dennis Mabuka,c4c48808-a52e-4feb-875d-b0970fe7fd50
Super Bowl: Kroenke's LA Rams on a very different path to Arsenal ,"Arsenal and the Los Angeles Rams are both owned by Stan Kroenke but that's right about where the similarities end. One team's young coach has already established himself as a legitimate gamechanger, one of the sport's brightest young minds who has already seen assistants plucked away by clubs wanting just a small dose of his magic.  The jury is still out on the other coach as he looks to prove that he can be the man in charge on the biggest stage. One team has built a reputation of bringing in players no matter the cost, doing whatever it takes to load up on as much talent as possible. The other is no longer capable of signing the world's elite and recently watched a player once deemed their superstar walk away without a replacement. And, most importantly, one team is on the precipice of winning their sport's most coveted trophy while the other looks far, far away from those days. In short, the Rams are a team built to win now and in the future, while Arsenal remain a team in the wilderness. So when Kroenke watches his Rams take on the Cincinnati Bengals in Sunday's Super Bowl in the multi-billion dollar stadium he helped pay to build, Arsenal will most certainly be the furthest thing from his mind.  For Arsenal supporters, it's felt that way for a very, very long time. The Rams and Arsenal aren't the only sports franchises owned by Kroenke, who also owns the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and Colorado Rapids. But they are the two biggest, the two with the most worldwide appeal. And, as things stand, they find themselves in vastly different places in their respective sports. The Rams are one game away from ascending to the top of the NFL, having established themselves as one of the sport's top teams since making the move from St. Louis to Los Angeles in 2016.  That move was a controversial one, much like any that sees a team ripped from its community, but you can't say it hasn't been successful. In Los Angeles, the Rams have captured the glitz and glam of a true Hollywood team. Their home, SoFi Stadium, might just be the finest sports arena in the world. It cost over $5 billion to build. For clarity, that's over four times as expensive as the cost to build the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The team that plays there, meanwhile, is one that has brought in plenty of expensive starpower. Since moving to LA, the Rams have made numerous win-now moves, sacrificing money and future assets for a chance at glory. They've traded away draft picks and used up every cent of the salary cap to bring in star players whenever the opportunity has arisen. Just this year, they've brought in key contributors Odell Beckham Jr, Von Miller and Sony Michel to join a team that already had stars like Cooper Kupp, Jalen Ramsey and Aaron Donald, all of whom are arguably the best players in the world at their respective positions. But the big move was trading for Matthew Stafford, and it's that move that has gotten them this far.  Stafford, the team's starting quarterback, had spent his entire career with the lowly Detroit Lions but, when the opportunity arose for the Rams to bring in a true franchise quarterback, they didn't waste it. The Rams traded Jared Goff, their former starter, along with a 2021 third-round pick and two first-round picks in 2022 and 2023 to bring in Stafford. And here they are, one game away from a title with Stafford leading the charge. Arsenal, on the other hand, have been unable to attract a similar level of talent in recent seasons. Sure, they've splashed the cash to sign players like Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Aaron Ramsdale, Thomas Partey and Nicolas Pepe, but there are few that would argue any of those players are truly the best in the world in their position. The Rams are in the Super Bowl for the second time in four seasons while Arsenal are struggling to truly compete with the elite of the Premier League.  In terms of coaching, the Rams also have one of the best in the business in Sean McVay.  The 36-year-old became the youngest head coach in modern history when he was hired in 2017 and, in the years since, he's built the Rams into a juggernaut.  He took the league's lowest-scoring offense and turned it into a machine, changing the perception of the Rams within just a few short years.  He's also changed the perception of how the league views young coaches, with several of his assistants being hired away by other teams looking for the next McVay.  Several of McVay's former assistants are now head coaches of top NFL teams, including Zac Taylor, who will face McVay as the Bengals' boss on Sunday.  Matt LaFleur, meanwhile, helped the Green Bay Packers dominate the regular season, while Brandon Staley has totally retooled the Los Angeles Chargers across town. In the NFL, coaching trees are a big deal and teams are always looking to find a guy that has spent the last few years learning under the main man. Right now, McVay certainly is the guy as he's emerged as the NFL's Pep Guardiola, if you will. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta's rise to the Arsenal job came partly because he came with that Guardiola shine. Arteta had long been earmarked for management, sure, but it was his stint as Guardiola's top assistant that truly thrust him into the spotlight.  Arteta has had to guide Arsenal through one rough patch after another. Since the years leading up to Arsene Wenger's departure, Arsenal have always been a game or two away from crisis mode, and every manager in charge has had to try and manage those crises while keeping pace with the Manchester Citys and Liverpools of the world. So far, that's been impossible. Even this season, Arsenal have faced a bumpy road, with the recent exit of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leaving the club without its superstar. No replacement was brought in, though, as the Gunners didn't show any Rams-like ambition to sign a talented striker. As things stand, Arsenal sit sixth in the league with games in hand and very, very real chances of securing a top-four finish. Doing so could serve as the springboard needed to push this club right back into the top of English football, where Arsenal fans will feel they belong. Until then, they'll have to watch on as their sister club competes for their own trophy a whole ocean away, hoping that the ambition shown by the Rams can somehow find its way to London sooner rather than later.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/la-rams-super-bowl-arsenal-kroenke-clubs-on-different-paths/blt709e0d1ca16ff340,Ryan Tolmich,0a9c98d0-759c-411a-9b10-756c31e6a5da
'Let the pretty ones play in bikinis' - Germany's first female agent explains how she beat sexist comments,"Jasmina Covic broke through the glass ceiling in 2014 when becoming the youngest and only female agent in the German football business. Today she runs the Women‚Äôs Football Agency ‚Äì the first of its kind to specialise in women‚Äôs football consultancy ‚Äì alongside Brian Eylert, who once worked with iconic figures such as Lothar Matthaus and Nadine Angerer. It has been a long road to this point, but every obstacle put in Covic‚Äôs path ‚Äì from narrow-minded sexism to stereotypes in the sporting agency world ‚Äì have been cleared in groundbreaking fashion. Speaking to GOAL and SPOX about her initial efforts to work with a men‚Äôs football agency, Covic said: ‚ÄúI contacted a few. ‚ÄúHowever, I either didn't get any feedback or received a disapproving response like: 'Nobody is interested in women's football anyway'. ""An agent once said to Brian: 'What do you want with that? Let the pretty ones play in bikinis and lock the ugly ones away.' ‚ÄúPeople like that are now suddenly also involved in women's football, the great women's experts, and some even call themselves women whisperers. That made me smile a bit.‚Äù Covic is working hard to break down barriers and level playing fields, but concedes her life is still made more difficult than it should be by contradictory approaches within the male and female games. She said: ‚ÄúWith women, there is a huge fight for sponsors, supplier contracts and equality. You fight for everything, so to speak. It is much easier for an average male Bundesliga player than for an average female Bundesliga player. ‚ÄúOne of our national players is the only one without a supplier contract. Adidas says they don't have the money, but when I hear that an average male player can go shopping with the whole family, and even the agent, at the expense of the supplier, I don't know what to say. ‚ÄúWe have always worked closely with Puma because they were the only brand that supported women's football. Now they have the problem that the players are being poached by Adidas and Nike.‚Äù On the advice that is offered to female footballers, Covic said: ‚ÄúSome of the players don't care if the advice is bad or if they have no significant experience in women's football. ‚ÄúMen come in expensive cars and fancy brands and tell them how rich they are and which famous men they have already worked with. That impresses the girls. This makes them fall for people who have nothing to do with women's football. Some players and parents are way too naive. ‚ÄúA German female national player once thought it was great that she became the first woman to work with a big men's agency. Yet they have never worked with a woman and have no idea whatsoever. Some of them just make you shake your head.‚Äù",https://www.goal.com/en/news/covic-sexist-bikini-comments-groundbreaking-agent-women/bltdec6042713c84b8a,Stanislav Schupp,4395ba92-9c47-45f1-8eb0-7f2d48a27313
'A joy to watch him play' - Fearless Elanga an unlikely Man Utd role model for Ronaldo and Rashford,"Manchester United substitute Anthony Elanga was given one job by Ralf Rangnick before he stepped onto the pitch at the Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday night: scare Atletico Madrid's defenders.¬† It took the teenager just five minutes, and one touch, to realise his goal, with the Swede earning the visitors a 1-1 draw in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with the Spanish titleholders by latching onto the first good pass played by Bruno Fernandes all evening before coolly finishing past Jan Oblak. Perhaps if the forwards selected to start the game had played with the same level of ruthlessness and fearlessness, United wouldn't have found themselves needing to be rescued by a teenage replacement.¬† Elanga certainly didn‚Äôt perform like someone who has seen more game time in the UEFA Youth League this season than the Champions League. His goal oozed composure and confidence, and he was not intimidated by the hostile atmosphere created by the home fans.¬† ‚ÄúI have dreamt of moments like this, scoring in the Champions League against top European teams like Atletico Madrid,"" he told BT Sport. ""It's a dream come true. ‚ÄúI told you how calm and cool I am, and whenever I am given an opportunity, I want to repay the manager and give 150 per cent every time I step onto the pitch. ""I just do what I can do. I want to be the best player on the pitch and I appreciate the boss.‚Äù What a moment for 19-year-old Anthony Elanga! üôå pic.twitter.com/QVGhTdTuLb The appreciation between Elanga and Rangnick is mutual. If the 19-year-old had got his way, he would have left the club on loan in the January transfer window but Rangnick had already seen enough to know he wanted him to stay. Before he took charge of his first training session, he had watched clips of Elanga on YouTube and the 19-year-old was the standout performer in Rangnick's first training session.¬† ‚ÄúHe really is playing as though it is a dream come true,"" Rangnick told reporters after the game in Madrid. ""It is a joy and fun to watch him play. ""I wish a few other players would take him as an example and as a role model. ‚ÄúI think right now he has just shown what is possible in football with the right mentality, the right approach, because this is exactly what he did and what he always does in every training session.‚Äù The German boss stopped short of naming the members of his squad that are disappointing him but, after the first-half display at the Metropolitano, you could have put the majority of the team in that bracket.¬† United knew what they were coming into. The raucous atmosphere at Leeds on Sunday was just a warm-up for Wednesday night. Thousands of Atleti fans lined the streets around the stadium hours before kick-off to give the team coach a hostile welcome and United's players were booed and jeered every time they touched the ball.¬† It was an occasion where the biggest stars in the squad needed to step up but, instead, especially in the first half, they appeared overwhelmed by the occasion, looking nervous and lacking in intensity and drive.¬† Maguire leads #MUFC out in Madrid. Some stadium. pic.twitter.com/53TxbQwV92 United only managed to turn the game around because of Rangnick‚Äôs changes. Elanga, brought on with just a quarter of an hour to play, managed in five minutes what Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Cristiano Ronaldo had failed to achieve between them: a shot on target.¬† Given his recent form, Sancho could be forgiven for having a quiet evening, but the way in which Ronaldo and Rashford struggled was concerning. Ronaldo has had plenty of joy against Atletico in his career but he will not be adding this 1-1 draw to any of the classic encounters he has in his memory bank.¬† As for Rashford, he is totally out of sorts at the moment. He wasn't the only player guilty of poor passing and questionable decision-making, of course, but when you also factor in his lack of goal threat, it's hard to argue in favour of him starting against Watford this weekend. Rashford's talent is undeniable but he is going through a tough time at the moment and his confidence has been affected. ""He looks too anxious for me; he looks like he‚Äôs almost trying too hard,"" Paul Scholes told BT Sport. ""Every time the ball comes to him it almost feels like he‚Äôs trying to do something magical. It‚Äôs probably the worst thing you can do."" The contrast between Rashford and Elanga right now couldn't be starker. The Swede looks cool, calm, confident and, most importantly, he is giving Rangnick exactly what he is asking of his players. Some of United's superstars have an unlikely new role model.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/elanga-man-utd-role-model-ronaldo-rashford/blte3b20ff6b6ba04e1,Charlotte Duncker,f474d0e0-d0f9-4aa3-b395-010fdf020a5b
Nice director of football Fournier reveals how he sells young stars like Kluivert on club's 'huge fantasy',"Nice sporting director Julien Fournier has revealed how he sells young stars like Justin Kluivert on the club's ""huge fantasy"".  Nice are currently enjoying a stellar 2021-22 campaign that has seen them rise to second in Ligue 1 after 20 matches, although they are 11 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Christophe Galtier's side are on course to qualify for the Champions League, with the French coach quickly gelling together a strong team after a busy summer of transfers helped by the huge financial backing of owners Ineos. Kluivert, Jean-Clair Todibo, Melvin Bard and Calvin Stengs have all impressed as Nice have emerged as surprise top-four contenders and Fournier has now offered an insight into how he has been able to bring so many talented young players to the club. ""I may be putting down a huge fantasy, but it's done in a simple way,"" the Nice chief told GOAL. ""For my part, I like to move around, show the interest of the club and meet the player in his environment.  ""That is to say, I try to invite myself to his home - and if I can't, we meet in the private rooms of a hotel. When we want to look for a young player, I always try to see the parents.  ""Apart from the agent, I like to talk to the family members because it also allows me to get a feel for the boy's environment."" Fournier added on how he went about arranging the Dutch forward's loan move from Roma: ""We can take the example of Justin Kluivert, in whom we showed interest very early on.  ""Initially, Nice didn't speak to him much, even though he had played and lost against us with Amsterdam [in 2017-18 Champions League qualification]. ""He was coming off three clubs that had played in the Champions League and was perhaps aspiring for something else. So I brought him to the training centre during an OGC Nice match against Reims, before going to see him.  ""That allowed me to show him the facilities and to have a discussion with him in total secrecy. At the time, I couldn't tell him who the coach would be but I said to him 'you'll see, we'll have a top level coach, trust me on that'.  ""He came back a second time with Calvin Stengs. We locked ourselves in the office for a morning with Christophe Galtier and the discussion was about tactical questions. ""We also explained what we, as a club, wanted to do, the competitions they will have to play, the competition they will have and the ambition we have for them."" Nice's wealthy ownership also means Nice do not have to sell on their best players later, a fate often suffered by ambitious mid-table clubs aiming higher in their leagues. Fournier said: ""The project is the same. Today, the arrival of Ineos allows us to keep our best players. At one time, Amine Gouiri would have been sold, as would Kasper Dolberg or Kephren Thuram. The real difference today is in our ability to keep our best players to be competitive in the long term."" Galtier earned plaudits from across Europe after leading unfancied Lille to Ligue 1 glory last season, but just two days after lifting the trophy he announced his decision to leave the club. Nice managed to convince him to embark on a new challenge with the backing of their Ineos ownership group chaired by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, tying him down to a three-year contract. Fournier confirmed Galtier had been on the club's radar long before his title triumph with Lille as they sought to appoint a coach capable of taking their ambitious project to the next level. ""We had identified him, and I'd like to say convinced him, before he became French champion,"" he said. ""Even without winning the Ligue 1, he would have been at OGC Nice.  ""The choice of coach is also a question of timing and we were wrong to bring in Claude Puel and then Lucien Favre.  ""The arrival of Christophe Galtier came at the right time in relation to his profile and where the club is at."" Pressed on his relationship with Galtier, Fournier replied: ""We've known each other for 20 years and he and I have been working together for several years.  ""With Christophe, it's a bit special because we've always had a relationship and a bond, so without me telling him about it, he knew about the project because it was part of our friendly discussions.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/nice-director-of-football-fournier-kluivert-huge-fantasy/blt5bbce529f8c5d371,Marc Mechenoua,4413a331-78b4-4fa2-9a84-90800fa19773

"Afcon 2021: Burkina Faso vs Senegal Preview - Kick-off time, TV channel, squad news","Burkina Faso will be looking to cause an upset when they face tournament favourites, Senegal in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations semi-final match at Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Cameroon on Wednesday.The Stallions are in buoyant mood after defeating a strong Tunisia side 1-0 in their quarter-final clash on Saturday with Dango Ouattara scoring the all-important goal for the West African side.The narrow win earned Burkina Faso their fourth appearance in the semi-finals and they¬†are now hoping to reach the final of Africa's most prestigious football tournament for the second time.Coach Kamou Malo's side will come up against a formidable Senegal side which has hit form at the right time having brushed aside giant slayers, Equatorial Guinea 3-1 in their quarter-finals on Sunday.Prior to that, the Lions of Teranga had secured a comfortable 2-0 win over Cape Verde in the Round of 16 as they kept their hopes of winning their first-ever Afcon title on track.The West African side is making their sixth appearance in the semi-finals and they are eager to reach back to back finals having lost to Algeria in the 2019 final.¬† Burkina Faso will be without two key attackers when they face their West African rivals with Dango Ouattara suspended after being sent off against Tunisia, while Djibril Ouattara is also expected to miss the game due to an injury which he picked up in the same match.Malo could bring in Russia-based centre forward Mohamed Konate and Aston Villa star Bertrand Traore as the abovementioned duo's replacement in the starting line-up.Traore - Burkina Faso vice-captain - was surprisingly an unused substitute against Tunisia, but Malo is most likely to unleash the experienced forward, who scored as they defeated Gabon in the Round of 16 and he could be the man to inspire the Stallions to the final. Meanwhile, Senegal have no suspension concerns and they are yet to report any injuries in their camp ahead of the West African Derby encounter.It will be interesting to see whether coach Aliou Cisse will hand Cheikhou Kouyate a starting berth after the former Lions of Teranga captain came off the bench to score the team's second goal which restored their lead against¬†Equatorial Guinea.Sadio Mane, who provided a sublime assist against Equatorial Guinea, will carry the Lions of Teranga's hopes of reaching the final. The Liverpool star grabbed a goal and an assist the last time he faced Burkina Faso which was in September 2017. In Head-to-Head stats, Burkina Faso and Senegal will meet for the 13th time across all competitions.The Lions of Teranga have the edge in this rivalry as they have recorded three wins compared to the Stallions' two, while seven matches ended in draws.The two sides have met twice in the Afcon finals with Senegal securing a 3-1 win in a Group C match at the 2000 tournament in Nigeria, before the two teams drew 0-0 in a Group C clash at the 2004 edition in Tunisia.The last meeting between the two teams was in September 2017 and Burkina Faso held Senegal to a 2-2 draw in the 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier in¬†Ouagadougou.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-burkina-faso-vs-senegal-preview-kick-off-time-tv/blte188a9a5d9fa55a0,Austin  Ditlhobolo,d48b2b67-bd98-4498-a413-162184eaeb56
Manchester United most expensive signings: How Red Devils splashed over ¬£2 billion on incoming transfers,"Manchester United are one of the most decorated clubs in the history of English football. The Red Devils have won more major trophies than any other English club and have clinched the most Premier League/English top division titles. A major chunk of their successes came in the last three decades and mostly during the era of their legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who guided the team to multiple titles, including 13 Premier League, two Champions League, five FA Cups and four League Cups among many others However, the Red Devils' success has come at a price as they have spent more than ¬£2 billion in the 21st century years on player signings. Just at the turn of the century, United spent ¬£41.4m to sign Rio Ferdinand, which was the club's record signing until Angel Di Maria joined in 2014 for ¬£ 67.5m from Real Madrid.

Zabaleta: Chelsea transfer arrival Sterling not a Man City legend,"Raheem Sterling is not a Manchester City club legend, believes former player Pablo Zabaleta, though he did ""a great job"" in helping to steer them to a period of remarkable success. The England international ended his seven-year stay at the Etihad Stadium this summer with a move from Pep Guardiola's Citizens to join Chelsea, under Thomas Tuchel. Sterling leaves behind a record littered with major accolades, as he aims to solidify his spot for the Three Lions at the Qatar 2022 World Cup - but for former title winner Zabaleta, he never quite reached the iconic levels of several of his club contemporaries. ""I think the word ‚Äòlegend‚Äô is a bit overused in football,"" Zabaleta told Sky Sports on the matter of Sterling's legacy. ""He‚Äôs done a great job for the club. He came at a very young age and has been absolutely brilliant. ""[But] when I say legend, for me, [Sergio] Aguero, [David] Silva, [Vincent] Kompany, those guys and a different level. That is why they have statues outside the stadium."" Arriving in 2015 from Liverpool to much fanfare, the winger set about solidifying his position as one of the top English talents of his generation. A four-time Premier League winner, he completed a sweep of all major domestic honours under Pep Guardiola and helped the club finish as runners-up against his new side in the 2021 Champions League Final. But despite impressive numbers and accolades - he was the FWA Footballer of the Year for the 2018-19 season - some fans have been reluctant to hold him in the same rarefied air as several of his team-mates.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/zabaleta-chelsea-transfer-arrival-sterling-not-a-man-city/bltb0d035ec57390ee7,Andrew Steel,5953bfb0-012b-4a50-8d10-cb2fe6577df3
PSG and Real Madrid set for post-Mbappe transfer battle as both sides target Tchouameni,"PSG are making a late bid to snatch Aurelien Tchouameni from under the noses of Real Madrid, GOAL understands Los Blancos are in talks with Monaco for the highly-rated midfielder but have not yet completed the deal. That has given PSG hope they can convince the France international to move to Paris instead, with Kylian Mbappe reportedly a big fan of the 22-year-old. GOAL understands Real Madrid have been in talks over a deal for Tchouameni for over a year, with former Monaco director of football Luis Campos playing a key role in discussions. Mbappe is also believed to have recommended the signing of his France team-mate when he was in talks over a potential move to Santiago Bernabeu himself. After Mbappe decided to sign a new deal at PSG instead, the Spanish giants accelerated their pursuit of Tchouameni in attempt to ward off rivals also interested in his services. One of those rivals is PSG, with Mbappe now calling for the French champions to bring Tchouameni to Parc des Princes. Further bolstering PSG‚Äôs cause is the imminent arrival of Campos as the club‚Äôs new sporting director, with the Portuguese attempting to change Tchouameni‚Äôs mind over a move to Spain. In addition, there could yet be a third side to enter the race: Chelsea. The Premier League side have scouted the player heavily, including looking at what he is like off the pitch. However, the Blues must wait for their takeover to be completed before making a move. They also have to make a decision on the futures of N‚ÄôGolo Kante and Jorginho, who are about the enter the final 12 months of their contracts. The duo could be sold to make room for Tchouameni, or offered new deals if boss Thomas Tuchel still thinks they have a long-term future at the club.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/psg-real-madrid-post-mbappe-transfer-battle-both-sides/blt343ac697505f70c7,Jorge C.

Manchester City spent ¬£35m on agent fees in 2021-22 with Man Utd a close second with ¬£29m splashed out,"Premier League champions Manchester City spent more money on agent fees over the last year than any other side in the division, with ¬£35 million ($46m) splashed out to help facilitate transfers. Local rivals Manchester United were second on the list with ¬£29 million ($38m) paid to intermediaries. In total the current 20 Premier League clubs paid out ¬£272.6 million ($359.9m) to agents between February 2021 and the end of the 2022 January transfer window, which is a slight increase on last year's figure of ¬£272.2 million ($359.3m). Man City top the agent spending table after a year which saw them break the British transfer record by signing Jack Grealish from Aston Villa for ¬£100 million ($139m). They also completed a ¬£14 million ($18m) deal for River Plate forward Julian Alvarez in January. Their spending would have been higher had they succeeded in their attempts to lure Tottenham striker Harry Kane last summer, but the England skipper remained in north London. Man Utd meanwhile spent ¬£73 million ($101m) on Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund and ¬£41 million ($57m) for Real Madrid centre-back Raphael Varane. Then late in the summer window they completed a sensational deal to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus for an initial ¬£13 million ($18m). Third on the spending list is Chelsea, whose ¬£28.2m ($37.2m) agent fee payments includes their club-record ¬£98 million ($133m) capture of Romelu Lukaku. Liverpool are fourth with ¬£22.1m ($29.1m), with their major signings including Ibrahima Konate and Luis Diaz. Fifth on the list is Arsenal, who spent ¬£18.7 million ($24.6m), with north London rivals Tottenham next with ¬£13.9m ($18.3m) and then Watford, who were promoted from the Championship last year, with ¬£12.6 million ($16.6m).

Cavani nears Valencia deal after 'bitter' Man Utd ending,"WHAT'S HAPPENING? Edinson Cavani is very close to signing with Valencia, GOAL can confirm. Cavani is set to sign a two-year contract with the Spanish club that will see him earn about ‚Ç¨2 million per season. THE BIGGER PICTURE: The move comes after Cavani left Manchester United this summer, saying that his tenure left him with a ""bitter taste"" due to the lack of personal and team success during his final campaign at Old Trafford. Cavani, meanwhile, was labelled a ""disgrace"" by club legend Paul Scholes, who questioned the forward's commitment to the club. AND WHAT'S MORE: Cavani, however, drew plenty of interest this summer, having been linked to Boca Juniors and Villarreal. However, the best offer came from Nice, who were willing to pay Cavani more than double what Valencia offered. IN THREE PHOTOS: Cavani was overshadowed at Man Utd after Cristiano Ronaldo's arrival Cavani will hope for one more World Cup run with Uruguay  Cavani would now play under Valencia manager Gennaro Gattuso. What a duo!  THE VERDICT: Having already played in Italy, France and England, a stint in Spain seems like a logical new frontier for Cavani. Having struggled for form and fitness at Man Utd, he'll get the chance to prove he's still the Cavani of old for a club like Valencia, who will hope the Uruguayan can help lift them back towards the top of La Liga. It seems a logical fit for all involved, and how could you not be excited by the idea of Cavani playing for someone like Gennaro Gattuso? WHAT NEXT FOR CAVANI AND VALENCIA? The deal is close to being finalised, with Cavani desperate to find his next club before the transfer window shuts in Europe. With Cavani coming in, Valencia will try to move either Marcos Andre or Maxi Gomez¬†to free up the money to sign the Uruguayan.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/cavani-nears-valencia-deal-after-bitter-man-utd-ending/blt523708dd8b72d90e,Ruben Uria,e3171e5e-2b5f-4e73-ad6c-2d25e5607ff7
'You didn't sleep' - Shakhtar coach De Zerbi reveals harrowing Ukraine escape during Russian attack,"Shakhtar Donetsk coach Roberto De Zerbi is back in his native Italy after a harrowing journey out of war-torn Ukraine, and he has described the desperate situation he and his players faced following Russia's recent military invasion.  The ex-Palermo, Benevento and Sassuolo boss found himself in Kyiv as Russian troops advanced on the capital.  He spent 24 hours huddled in a bunker in the basement of a hotel until finally managing to get out of the city and cross the border to safety.  ""[My time in the Kyiv attack] lasted 24 hours, but they passed very very slowly because you didn't sleep, at night you could hear everything,"" De Zerbi, who is now back in Italy along with the rest of his coaching staff, explained to Radio 105.   ""There were those who slept in the bunker [of the hotel] and those in the rooms. I slept in the room to understand what was happening outside the hotel, when I heard a roar would go into the bunker. Then I would go back to my room after a few hours. ""We are back at home thanks to the commitment of the UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin who showed great humanity, incredible sensitivity, he organised everything down to the smallest detail and even the embassy treated us well."" As well as De Zerbi, Dynamo Kyiv coach Paulo Fonseca was also able to cross the border into Romania, after a 30-hour coach trip across the country due to the lack of flights.  De Zerbi went on to pay tribute to the Ukrainians who have stayed at home to fight Russian troops in Kyiv and across the nation. ""[Ukrainians] are defending freedom and those who defend freedom have an advantage. Of course, the difference in weapons potential shifts everything. ""From what I have seen, they can continue, no one knows for how long.

'The manager decides the tactics' - Van Gaal snaps at Van Dijk over Netherlands formation following Denmark win,"Louis van Gaal has snapped back at Virgil van Dijk over his comments on the Netherlands' formation following their win against Denmark. The Netherlands produced an impressive attacking display to beat Denmark 4-2 in a friendly clash at Johan Cruyff ArenA on Saturday, with Steven Bergwijn hitting a brace and Nathan Ake and Memphis Depay also getting on the scoresheet. Van Gaal has recorded six wins and two draws since returning to coach his country for the third time last September, but his captain is not a big fan of his preferred system. Liverpool star Van Dijk voiced his opinion after the win over Denmark, telling reporters: ""Until today we have been training hard, with lots of tactics and meetings.¬†There are good times but also things to improve. We will analyse this. ""Of course, we are playing in a new system, different things are required of the players. I think we showed a lot of good things. ""Do I like the system? Well, I'm still in favour of 4-3-3 but I'm not the national coach and the national coach has a very strong opinion about it."" Van Gaal says he had previously sat down to Van Dijk to discuss his concerns over the formation, but won't be changing his methods in order to appease the Liverpool man. Speaking ahead of the Netherlands' next friendly against Germany on Tuesday, the 70-year-old told a press conference: ""I know he has that preference, he always said this publicly.

But he‚Äôs also mindful about taking care of players who have such a heavy workload and with the added requirement of international football - even greater this year because of the mid-season World Cup in Qatar, so it might seem strange to add an extra unnecessary fixture.

What results do USMNT need to qualify for World Cup 2022? Permutations for place in Qatar explained,"For fans of the United States Men's National Team, memories of failing to qualify for the World Cup in 2018 will still be fresh, with fears that the side could repeat their mistakes in the qualification campaign for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar. Gregg Berhalter's squad are on the brink of securing their place in the finals, but what do the USMNT need to do to clinch World Cup qualification? GOAL takes a look at the permutations. The USMNT have one qualifier left and, if they want to secure automatic qualification, they will just need to avoid a heavy defeat in their final match. The USMNT are currently second in the CONCACAF qualification table, three points behind leaders Canada and level on points with third-placed Mexico (but ahead in the table due to superior goal difference). A win or draw against Costa Rica on Wednesday would send the USMNT through, with Costa Rica heading to a playoff in fourth place. A loss by fewer than six goals would be enough for the U.S. to automatically qualify. The format of the CONCACAF World Cup 2022 qualification sees that the top three teams qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with the fourth-placed team having to play an an inter-federation playoff against a nation from Oceania (OFC).

Pedri follows in Iniesta's footsteps as Barcelona's new No.8,"Pedri has been confirmed as Barcelona's new No.8 for the 2022-23 season, with the teenage superstar taking the shirt made famous by club legend Andres Iniesta for the upcoming campaign. The 19-year-old, who moved to the Blaugrana from Las Palmas in 2020, has enjoyed two superb seasons for the club even as they have struggled with a successful hunt for silverware during that spell, establishing himself as a mainstay at both domestic and international level for Spain. That rich form has seen him rewarded with a bump up the pecking order for next term - and it will see him follow in the footsteps of Iniesta, as well as some other famous names at Camp Nou. The youngster was handed the No. 16 shirt in his first season with the club, as he arrived on the back of a dismal 2019-20 campaign that had seen the Blaugrana miss out on a trophy and suffer a legendary Champions League humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich. With the No. 8 shirt then occupied by Bosnia international Miralem Pjanic, Pedri was forced to fight for his spot, and did so, helping them to the 2021 Copa del Rey under Ronald Koeman. Yet when Pjanic was loaned out to Besiktas, Pedri was still retained at No. 16, with No. 8 handed instead to the returning Dani Alves - but now, the latter has departed the club for a second time, finally allowing the teenager to move up to a starting number.

But it is Iniesta with which the shirt is most associated, with the Spain legend taking the shirt number in 2007-08 and holding it through to his departure to Vissel Kobe in 2018 - where he also wears No. 8. During his time in the position, he arguably became the most feared midfielder in European and world football, and led Barcelona to a raft of major honours at home and abroad - though he famously wore No. 6 for Spain in the South Africa 2010 World Cup Final, with now-Barca manager Xavi instead sporting his number on the world stage.

""When you look at the number of teams that were behind him and he decided to come to us, I think this is a really strong statement. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to give us different options at the back and competitiveness between players. I‚Äôm really pleased that an important player like that decided to come to Palace."" Richards will be the fifth new arrival at Selhurst Park this summer, and arguably the biggest of the bunch, save perhaps England goalkeeper Sam Johnstone following the latter's arrival from West Bromwich Albion. The club are yet to credibly fill the gap vacated by Chelsea loanee Conor Gallagher however, who was at the heart of their success last term, earning England caps as a reward for his performances. Palace likely still need to add further creative potential to live up to the efforts they showed last year, but Vieira will hope his side can avoid a sophomore slump under his watch after an impressive first campaign at the helm.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/usmnt-star-richards-a-strong-statement-signing-for-crystal/blt61d720195b904019,Andrew Steel,cbcb8cc3-46cb-4b33-a356-04ad49ce2c34
Mbappe sulk explained by PSG boss Galtier after striker appears to stop running mid-attack during Montpellier victory,"Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier has explained why Kylian Mbappe appeared to sulk on the pitch after not receiving a pass from Vitinha during the club's win against Montpellier on Saturday. The French forward was among the scorers upon his return to the PSG starting XI as they thrashed their opponents 5-2 to make it two wins out of two in Ligue 1.  However, Mbappe also missed a penalty in the first half and appeared to throw a strop during one attack, with Galtier eventually taking the decision to substitute him with four minutes of normal time remaining. During the match, which was broadcast by BT Sport in the UK, PSG midfielder Vitinha made a run down the middle of the pitch from his own half and had the option to pass the ball towards Mbappe, who was on his left, and Lionel Messi, who made a run from the right flank.  In footage which went viral after the match, Vitinha ignored Mbappe's call and decided to push the ball towards Messi, leaving the French star visibly frustrated as he completely stopped his movement and turned his back on the play.

""Kylian played his last game three weeks ago so I knew it was going to be tough on a physical level for him,"" he told Canal Plus. ""He's a competitor. He wants to be good and he wants to be good quickly, but a top footballer is not on and off like that; it takes a little time to regain 100 per cent of his athletic abilities. ""When he's at 100 per cent, he'll make the difference even more. These are players who like to score, who want to score, who attack. It's a bit normal for him to be disappointed at being a little short physically compared to his teammates."" Great to have you back, @KMbappe!  #PSGMHSC I 4-1 pic.twitter.com/1v7H2el0zJ Mbappe was also backed by his teammate Marco Verratti, who insisted that his outburst just proves that he cares for the team. The Italian said: ""With the penalty, he sulked a bit but that's normal. He's a great player, he wants to make a difference.  ""It's good when he's angry, it means he cares about this team.""",https://www.goal.com/en/news/mbappe-sulk-explained-psg-boss-galtier-montpellier-victory/blt5f5d8a7b31da2f08,Ritabrata Banerjee,ad1d0f89-b28b-4427-9f08-a4fce154b6de
"Kulusevski ‚ÄòGimme, gimme, gimme‚Äô chant: Lyrics & meaning behind Tottenham fan song","Hopes were high when Tottenham moved to lure Dejan Kulusevski away from Juventus on an initial short-term loan agreement during the winter transfer window of 2022, but few could have predicted that he would make such an immediate impact in north London. The Sweden international winger has quickly become a fan favourite at Spurs, with another attacking weapon being added to Antonio Conte‚Äôs ranks alongside the more established duo of Harry Kane and Heung-min Son. Kulusevski has adjusted seamlessly to the demands of life in the Premier League and now has his very own terrace chant. How does that tune go? GOAL takes a look‚Ä¶ The song is sung to the tune of the ABBA track 'Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)' and goes: There‚Äôs not a soul out there,No one to hear my prayers,Gimme, gimme, gimme a ginger from Sweden,He came from Juventus,And he plays on the wing.

He feels proud to have been welcomed so quickly into the hearts of Spurs supporters, saying of the chant delivered in his honour: ""I love it, of course.

Real Madrid duo Bale & Hazard in top three highest-paid La Liga players despite hardly ever playing - and they're both above Benzema,"Gareth Bale is the highest-paid player in La Liga, according to Marca, while fellow Real Madrid outcast Eden Hazard occupies third spot on that list despite struggling to justify a ‚Ç¨100 million (¬£85m/$111m) price tag at Santiago Bernabeu. The Blancos fill six places inside a rundown of the top 10 biggest salaries in the Spanish top-flight, with prominent figures at Barcelona and Atletico Madrid completing that set. There are plenty of big names on a notable chart, but Bale and Hazard stand out in the top three having made just 21 Liga appearances, scoring one goal, between them this season. Bale, who joined Real from Tottenham in a record-breaking deal back in 2013, has made his way to the top of the list following the recent departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi from Spanish football. He is followed by club colleague Hazard, who made a move to the Bernabeu from Chelsea in 2019, and Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann ‚Äì with the French World Cup winner currently taking in a loan spell back at Wanda Metropolitano from Barcelona. Real captain Karim Benzema, who has been in red-hot form this season with 32 goals to his name from 34 appearances, can only take fourth spot. Barca skipper Sergio Busquets, with his entire professional career spent at Camp Nou after stepping out of the famed La Masia academy system, rounds off the top five. Rank Player Annual salary 1 Gareth Bale ‚Ç¨34m =2 Antoine Griezmann ‚Ç¨30m =2 Eden Hazard ‚Ç¨30m 4 Karim Benzema ‚Ç¨24m 5 Sergio Busquets ‚Ç¨23m 6 Toni Kroos ‚Ç¨22m =7 Jordi Alba ‚Ç¨20m =7 Jan Oblak ‚Ç¨20m =7 David Alaba ‚Ç¨20m =7 Luka Modric ‚Ç¨20m All figures as reported by Marca Jan Oblak of Atletico Madrid is the only goalkeeper on the list, with the Slovenian shot-stopper widely regarded as the best in the world in his chosen position. David Alaba was handed a lucrative deal when joining Real Madrid as a free agent in the summer of 2021, while Luka Modric‚Äôs value to the Blancos continues to be recognised in rolling 12-month agreements. The vast experience of Barcelona left-back Jordi Alba and Real midfielder Toni Kroos is also handsomely rewarded by their respective employers. Questions are being asked of how long both Bale and Hazard will be sticking around in Madrid. A Wales international that has savoured four Champions League triumphs during his time in Spain is due to become a free agent in the summer and has generated talk of heading into retirement if his country miss out on a place at the 2022 World Cup. Hazard is among those that Real are trying to offload as they look to free up funds and squad space that will allow moves for the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland to be made in the next transfer window. Atletico have the option of extending Griezmann‚Äôs loan, having brought him back from a frustrating two-year stint in Catalunya, while there has been speculation to suggest that Benzema will need to look for a new challenge in the not too distant future as Florentino Perez reverts back to his ‚ÄòGalacticos‚Äô recruitment model.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/real-madrid-bale-hazard-highest-paid-la-liga-hardly-playing/blt557505736f841d04,Chris Burton,53bcba90-c5fe-4bad-bda2-96837c3fe1b4

USMNT star Adams given Leeds transfer blessing as RB Leipzig coach admits 'it hurts to say goodbye',"Tyler Adams has been given the blessing of RB Leipzig coach Dominic Tedesco to seal his transfer to Leeds United - but the Bundesliga boss admits that ""it hurts to say goodbye"" to the U.S. men's national team star.  Midfielder Adams has departed the German outfit to undergo a medical with the Premier League side, who are expected to confirm his arrival as their fifth signing of the summer in short order. It reunites Adams with both former Leipzig boss Jesse Marsch and USMNT team-mate Brendan Aaronson, as he looks to push on for more game-time following limited minutes in Leipzig. ""The topic is so far through,"" Tedesco told RB Live on Adams' departure. ""He was very liked here, he‚Äôs a really good player. ""[He is] a fine character. It hurts to say goodbye. But you have to be honest with each other. ""If a player is unhappy with his playing time ‚Äì we have an extremely large number of players in the centre ‚Äì then you have to understand him and fulfill his wishes.‚Äù Tedesco is not the only figure to back Adams on making the leap to the Premier League, with the latter's USMNT team-mate Weston McKennie also speaking on the impending move. Taking to Instagram, the Juventus star included an image of Adams with the Leeds logo, and professed his delight on the switch. ""Yessss!

'They will fight on their battlefield - the football pitch': Dynamo Kyiv's youth team prepare to make Ukrainian sporting history,"Though a match between two youth teams taking place in Romania might not seem like a momentous occasion, on Thursday, such a game is taking place that will be about more than just football. Dynamo Kyiv‚Äôs Under-19s side will take on their counterparts from Sporting C.P. in the last 16 of the UEFA Youth League, marking the the first competitive match played by any Ukrainian team since Russia‚Äôs invasion of the country began on February 24. The war may have started less than two months ago, but it feels like an eternity, while no one could have predicted the disastrous scale of the damage that has been done. Not least Dynamo, who a week prior to Russia‚Äôs advancement into Ukraine, were complaining of Sporting‚Äôs refusal to enter the country, as the Portuguese outfit cited the increasing number of Putin‚Äôs troops appearing on the country‚Äôs border as a reason not to travel. ‚ÄúSporting decided to use the difficult situation in Ukraine in order to deny Dynamo of their home advantage,‚Äù read Ukrainian website Football24 ahead of a game that was originally scheduled to be played on March 1. ‚ÄúOn February 14, they wrote to UEFA, stating that they won't go to Kyiv, basing the decision on recommendations of their foreign ministry and the Portuguese embassy in Ukraine. ‚ÄúDynamo insist on playing in Kyiv, or at the very least in Lviv."" As it happened, UEFA insisted that the game be played in Kyiv, and rescheduled it for March 9. That announcement came on February 23. A few hours later, it proved utterly irrelevant. And while Sporting were proven right to have concerns, the whole row over when and where the game should be played does not matter now. Peace is the main objective, but trying to make life as normal as possible for the people of Ukraine will help maintain morale in the meantime. Football, then, has the opportunity to offer a glimpse of normality, even if the national champions currently find themselves over 900 kilometres (560 miles) away from home. When the war began, Dynamo's veteran Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu started negotiations with numerous key officials in his homeland in order to enable him and his players to move there. His mission proved to be successful, and in the beginning of April the first team of Dynamo began training in Bucharest, ahead of a series of high-profile friendlies against teams such as Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, with all proceeds to be donated to Ukraine. The U19s squad, though, moved to Romania even earlier, in the middle of March. Aided by FCSB owner Gigi Becali, they were provided with accommodation and training facilities, and began preparing for a game against Sporting that has suddenly taken on unimagined significance. ""It wasn't easy to assemble the team, because at the beginning of the war the players were not only in Kyiv, but also in Poltava, Cherkasy and other regions of Ukraine,‚Äù Dynamo‚Äôs deputy director general, Serhiy Mokhnyk, said. ‚ÄúWe will do our best to ensure that the young footballers, who are the future of our club, justify the trust put in them and represent Ukraine with dignity. ""The players are preparing for the upcoming match with great zeal and motivation. They are grateful for the chance to fight and defend the honour of Ukraine on their battlefield ‚Äì the football pitch. ‚ÄúThe young Dynamo players are trying to play this match for all their compatriots and will do their best to win, in order to give Ukraine at least a small moment of joy and sporting pride in the dark times of war.‚Äù Dynamo certainly are capable of pulling off a victory. They won 4-0 away at Bayern Munich and 4-1 at home to Barcelona in the group stages, with only four players having scored more goals in the competition than the five netted by Senegalese forward Samba Diallo, who has been likened to his compatriot Sadio Mane. Since their arrival in Romania, Lucescu has personally assisted U19s coach Ihor Kostyuk and attended all the team‚Äôs training sessions, while two friendly matches against Romanian opposition were scheduled, with Dynamo scoring five goals in each game. Now they are ready for the big test, which will take place at the newly-opened Giulesti Stadium, the home of Rapid Bucharest. Lucescu, who had two spells as Rapid coach in the 1990s, was present at the opening ceremony on March 26 in front of thousands of fans, who rose to their feet to give a standing ovation to their guests of honour, the Dynamo Kyiv players. Dynamo hope that the locals will now come and support them on Thursday, while Sporting find themselves in the strange position of being determined to win a game that almost everyone watching will be hoping they lose. ""We understand the importance of the moment,‚Äù Sporting coach Filipe Pedro said. ‚ÄúIt's much more than just a match. However, our goal is to qualify, and the players are focused on that. ""The fact that we didn't know if the game was going to take place affected us a bit psychologically. Of course, Dynamo had more difficulties, but they only played a couple of friendlies lately. Our team has a busier schedule, and less rest. ‚ÄúDynamo are proud to represent their country, but we also have a lot of ambitions.‚Äù All eyes, then, will be on Bucharest for what has unexpectedly turned out to be one of the most important UEFA Youth League matches in history.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/dynamo-kyiv-youth-league/blt5e68d724d72df40d,Michael Yokhin,72d596a1-e62d-4e74-8071-0360c87ede06
"Man Utd are still an attractive club, insists Rangnick after transfer capabilities called into question","Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick does not concede that the club are no longer a lucrative pull in the transfer market, especially if they fail to secure Champions League football. The Red Devils look set to be in the lower tiers of European competition next season, way off the race for a top-four finish as things stand. But ahead of another season-defining encounter with Chelsea, Rangnick insists the club still are an attractive proposition, pointing to Bruno Fernandes' recent renewal and the arrival of Erik ten Hag as his successor next term as key indicators of their allure. ""Of course, it would be better if we played Champions League next season but this also affects other clubs, it's not only a problem only Manchester United has,"" Rangnick said. ""The renewal of the contract of Bruno showed it is possible this club is an attractive club, with a new manager, a new approach, in the way he wants to play, this is still a massively interesting club. ""I look forward to helping Erik and everyone at the club to get the best and change the whole approach next season so Manchester United can be a top club again."" Ten Hag will likely face some kind of squad overhaul this summer, but quite who may be shown the door - and who may be brought into the fold - remains to be seen. Cristiano Ronaldo has a year left to run on his deal, but the absence of Champions League football may make the Portuguese consider twice about staying at Old Trafford. Paul Pogba meanwhile looks set to walk away from the Theatre of Dreams, but there could be a recall for Donny van de Beek from his loan stay with Everton, while Ten Hag may seek to raid current club Ajax for new faces.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-are-still-an-attractive-club-insists-rangnick-after/blt951dc6e70329e5ef,Andrew Steel,7311c738-082a-48e4-9759-59c885ad4e85
Pepi reveals 'big dream' of playing Champions League football with Augsburg and doesn't feel pressure of ‚Ç¨17.5m transfer fee,"Augsburg forward Ricardo Pepi has big ambitions with his new club, with the U.S. international hoping to take them to the Champions League.  Pepi, 19, joined the Bundesliga side from FC Dallas in a deal worth a reported ‚Ç¨17.5 million ($20m/¬£15m), making him the second most expensive player to move from MLS to Europe in league history.  And while Augsburg are currently in a relegation battle, the youngster sees big things on the horizon.

And that's the only way I could make progress."" Pepi's Bundesliga move also brings him closer to Robert Lewandowski, for whom the teenager has huge respect. ""I look up to Robert Lewandowski. I want to get to this level, I work on it every day,"" he added, while affirming that the value of his transfer will not hang over him. ""I wasn't the one who called that price. I don't feel any pressure at all, honestly.

Queretaro-Atlas match in Liga MX suspended due to ugly fan violence ,"Saturday's Liga MX match between Queretaro and Atlas was halted after a violent brawl involving dozens of fans at the Estadio Corregidora. Fans fought in the stands and on the field with several appearing to use weapons to cause injuries. The match was called off midway through the second half as the violence erupted throughout the stadium. There were numerous pictures and videos shared across social media showing graphic scenes, with Liga MX confirming several fans had been transported to the hospital. ""Unacceptable and unfortunate violence at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro,"" Liga MX president Mikel Arriola said on Twitter. ""Those responsible for the lack of security in the stadium will be punished in an exemplary manner. The safety of our players and fans is a priority!  ""The match will not be resumed for the protection of everyone's safety."" In a statement, Liga MX added: ""The league has begun an in-depth investigation into what happened in the stands, on the field and outside the stadium during Queretaro vs. Atlas. ""Corresponding criminal complaints will also be filed for the acts of violence at the Estadio Corregidora.  ""Reports of the Liga MX commissioner and the Queretaro authorities indicate that injured people were transferred by ambulance to nearby hospitals and the official report on their health status is awaited.

He added that the company that owns the club ""must answer for the facts. I have given instructions to apply the law with all its consequences. In Queretaro there is no impunity.""

Gvardiol to Chelsea? Leipzig respond to reports that Blues have launched ¬£77m transfer bid,"WHAT HAPPENED? It has been reported that the Blues are in advanced talks to sign the Croatian defender, who would head to Stamford Bridge in 2023 under the terms of any final deal. However, Leipzig chief Mintzlaff has indicated that they want Gvardiol to see out his current contract. WHAT THEY SAID: He told BILD when quizzed on Chelsea's interest: ""Josko is a great player who will certainly arouse a lot of interest - he still has a contract with us until 2026. We assume that he will not only play with us this season, but also next season."" THE BIGGER PICTURE: Chelsea are looking for centre-backs in the market after the departures of Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger. They have already signed Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli but remain in the hunt for another quality addition to shore up their defence, especially after conceding eight goals in their opening four Premier League matches. IN TWO PHOTOS:  WHAT NEXT FOR CHELSEA? Chelsea will look to return to winning ways when they take on West Ham at home on Saturday after falling 2-1 to Southampton in their latest outing.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/gvardiol-to-chelsea-leipzig-respond-reports-blues-launched/blt9696e89bf4c12f7f,Soham Mukherjee,acb271bd-30b6-4f3d-bfa5-b2874d98fa3d
Rudiger in verbal agreement to join Real Madrid on lucrative four-year deal ahead of Chelsea departure,"Antonio Rudiger is close to joining Real Madrid after giving his word during advanced negotiations over a lucrative four-year contract. It is unclear exactly what the 29-year-old will earn but it will be a significant pay-rise to his current Chelsea contract and similar to the ¬£200,000-a-week offering from the west London outfit. It is expected the Spanish giants will get their man after Carlo Ancelotti instructed his club to restart talks after failed negotiations in December. The aim is to complete the talks in the next week after Rudiger got frustrated waiting for Chelsea's takeover to be completed. The sanctions on the Stamford Bridge club mean they can't renew contracts for any of their players and, despite Thomas Tuchel and other senior staff asking Rudiger to wait until the takeover is complete, he opted to explore one of the many offers on the table. Ironically, some close to the process believe an answer on a new owner could come this week. For Rudiger, he will choose Madrid over options that include Manchester United, Barcelona and Juventus, with PSG and Bayern Munich having also previously had negotiations with him. Los Blancos could wait until the end of the season to announce Rudiger after he gave his word to Tuchel that he will remain focused and professional until the end of the season. ""He has no doubts and has made no doubts about it, he will play until the end of the season with everything he has,"" Tuchel said after his side's 1-0 win over West Ham this weekend. ""This is what he did from day one, and it's what he will do until the last minute. I am 100 per cent sure."" Chelsea do not have the ability to sign players until the ownership situation is resolved. However, the scouting teams continue to operate and Sevilla's Jules Kounde will likely remain a target for whoever comes in. Chelsea tried to sign Kounde last summer but saw their offers repeatedly snubbed for the France international. They are also known to be admirers of Leicester City's Wesley Fofana but he has signed a new deal at King Power Stadium. Similarly, Barcelona's Ronald Araujo was briefly a target but Xavi's team feel they will successfully renew their young defender's deal. It is likely that Tuchel will want to sign two defenders to replace both Rudiger and Andreas Christensen who is expected to join Barcelona. That is unless Huddersfield Town loanee Levi Colwill can impress enough in pre-season to force his way into Tuchel's plans.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/rudiger-real-madrid-deal-chelsea-departure/blt2300242b4d5821bf,Nizaar Kinsella,a7f25e74-10b1-41b4-96d5-fc82b4bbc1f7
Afcon 2021: Ugly Egypt must lose Salah dependence,"Mohamed Salah‚Äôs words before Egypt‚Äôs Round of 16 encounter with the Ivory Coast were particularly clear-cut. The Liverpool superstar emphasised the need for the team to be at the forefront and centre of Africa Cup of Nations conversations, rather than any one individual. ‚ÄúIf you love Egypt and the Egyptian national team, you should support the team and not a specific player,‚Äù Salah said before the Pharaohs played the Elephants.  ‚ÄúYou harm the player and make him feel that he‚Äôs more important than the team, and this is not true. There is no player more important than the team, whether it‚Äôs me or anyone else. ‚ÄúAlso, my message to people in the TV studios is that I hope you can talk about the entire team and not one or two individuals. I don‚Äôt follow these shows, but some follow and are affected by them. ‚ÄúKeep supporting the team until the end of the tournament and then talk about each player.‚Äù As is his wont, Salah is reasonably preaching the importance of a strong team dynamic, but there is a feeling his teammates ought to take those remarks on board as well. Indeed, it will not be out of place to imply the North African giants are reliant on the Liverpool star‚Äôs decisiveness for success. Truthfully, it will be hard not to because of his ability, menace and end product. The former Chelsea attacker entered this year‚Äôs finals as the best player at the showpiece and arguably the best in the world owing to strong performances and wider consistency for Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs men. He signed off before Afcon in style, too, scoring a brilliant strike at Stamford Bridge as Liverpool and the Blues played out a 2-2 draw at his old stomping ground. It signalled the Egypt talisman‚Äôs readiness for the finals, looking to inspire the seven-time winners to an eighth crown. Be that as it may, it has far from plain sailing despite the Pharaohs confirming their place in the imminent quarter-finals following a shootout success over Ivory Coast on Wednesday. It ended goalless after 120 minutes, with quality chances at a premium. While Egypt have let in only one goal all competition ‚Äî their 1-0 defeat by Nigeria ‚Äî they have not pulled up trees at the finals‚Ä¶and neither has Salah. Of course, the forward‚Äôs goal against Guinea-Bissau earned the North Africans their first points of the competition, but their absence of a killer instinct could have been costly had Mama Balde‚Äôs 84th-minute strike stood. With their best player still to find his range, the team have struggled for goals as a consequence, and Mohamed Abdelmoneim remains the only player not named Salah to score for Egypt in Cameroon. Maybe this situation should not come as a surprise. Before the start of the ongoing competition, the 29-year-old had been involved in 60 percent of the nation‚Äôs goals at Afcon finals since his 2017 debut, scoring four times and assisting two of the side‚Äôs 10 strikes. Heading into what will be a mouth-watering North African derby with Morocco, he has now scored five and set up a couple of his team‚Äôs 12 strikes since 2017. Perhaps worryingly, Carlos Queiroz‚Äôs team have struggled to fashion quality chances for most of the tournament and it is no surprise Salah‚Äôs goal against Guinea-Bissau is hitherto the nation‚Äôs only one from open play. Amid all the ongoing troubles has been an excessive inclination to lean on the Liverpool man, passing him the ball at every opportunity even when there are other sensible passing options for the man in possession. While you understand how the presence of a talented player could often lead to such an overdependence, the Pharaohs‚Äô proclivity is arguably doing more harm than good for their Afcon prospects. The absence of any integration was obvious against Nigeria and the inability to convince in subsequent victories over Guinea-Bissau, Sudan and Ivory Coast is a concern for Africa‚Äôs greatest side. Weaning Egypt off their Salah dependency will likely increase the North African nation‚Äôs Afcon chances, yet such an eventuality is improbable to foresee‚Ä¶not at the ongoing finals, at least.",https://www.goal.com/en/news/afcon-2021-ugly-egypt-must-lose-salah-dependence/blt97ae090e0aa7a043,Seye Omidiora,18b0b11a-7f55-444f-8606-a394184886d7
